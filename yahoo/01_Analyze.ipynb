Who applied it to a football field and why? ; Hi there...\\n\\nHere is the answer I found from the Word Detective site:\\n\\nThe use of \"gridiron\" as a metaphor for the football field, and, by extension, to the game itself, dates back to 1897. The original \"gridirons\" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a \"gridiron,\" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of \"gridiron\" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.</td>\n",

       "2786  Where does the term Grid Iron originate and how did it get applied to a football field.? ; What is the original meaning of gridiron. Who applied it to a football field and why? ; Hi there...\\n\\nHere is the answer I found from the Word Detective site:\\n\\nThe use of \"gridiron\" as a metaphor for the football field, and, by extension, to the game itself, dates back to 1897. The original \"gridirons\" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a \"gridiron,\" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of \"gridiron\" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.                                                                                                                             \n",

Who applied it to a football field and why? ; Hi there...\\n\\nHere is the answer I found from the Word Detective site:\\n\\nThe use of \"gridiron\" as a metaphor for the football field, and, by extension, to the game itself, dates back to 1897. The original \"gridirons\" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a \"gridiron,\" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of \"gridiron\" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.</td>\n",

       "2786  Where does the term Grid Iron originate and how did it get applied to a football field.? ; What is the original meaning of gridiron. Who applied it to a football field and why? ; Hi there...\\n\\nHere is the answer I found from the Word Detective site:\\n\\nThe use of \"gridiron\" as a metaphor for the football field, and, by extension, to the game itself, dates back to 1897. The original \"gridirons\" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a \"gridiron,\" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of \"gridiron\" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.                                                                                                                             \n",
