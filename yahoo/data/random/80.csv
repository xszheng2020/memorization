1,"Marble Rollocoster? ; I am learning about Nutin's law an object going in a straight line will remain to until it is acted on. I am doing an obsticle corse for it in school, so does anyone know anything that will slow a marble down? ; A marble is a rolling mass.  The theory is that the marble rolls along and the area of the marble in contact with the surface it is rolling on is not slipping.\n\nAs the marble rolls along, the forces that act on it are \n\n1.  Gravity\n\n2.  Air resistance\n\nI recommend that you focus on gravity to create forces of predictable magnitude and direction.  You can use ramps and then apply Newton's laws and a little trig to calculate the force magnitudes and predict the motion of the marble. As long as you have a decent velocity without being too fast, air resistance will be negligible.\n\nI designed a simple track for you that you could make out of light plywood and some glue.\n\nThe track I propose will be a valley that is 2 meters long (a little over 6 feet) and 1/2 meter wide( 20 inches wide will give you some margin).  The valley sides are set at an angle of 30 degrees.  At one end of the valley at the top of the valley side set up a ramp that will inject a marble such that the direction of the velocity of the marble is straight with respect to the edge of the valley.  The height of the ramp will control the velocity of the.\n\nNow, consider a coordinate system that has x starting from the same end as the ramp and running parallel to the sides of the valley.  y is perpindicular to the sides of the valley.\n\nI created a variable, h, that is the vertical height of the starting end of the ramp with respect to the entry point of the marble.\nUsing conservation of energy, the velocity of the marble will be related through the equation:\n1/2*m*v^2=m*g*h\nv=sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nThe time it will take the marble to roll the length of the valley I set as t\nlength of the valley is 2m\nso 2m=v*t\nt=2/sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nWhen the marble enters the top edge of the valley it will have a velocity in the x direction of v as derived above.  This is your constant velocity since the only forces that will act on the marble in the x direction is air resistance, which we will assume to be negligible.\nSince the marble enters the valley near the top edge, it will be acted on by gravity to pull it down the edge.  If you have the marble enter the ramp at exactly .25m from the center, it reach the center of the ramp in time t'\nwhere \n.25=1/2*g*cos(30)*t'^2\nor t'=sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\n\nI thought it would be fun to consider an experiment where you control how many times the marble rolls across the center of the valley before exiting at the other end.\nThis I set as N\nNote that t/t'=N\nN=(2/sqrt(2*g*h))/sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\nN=2*sqrt(g*cos(30))/sqrt(2*g*h*.5)\nN=2*sqrt(cos(30)/h)\n\nThen I thought that it would be fun to set up an equation where we decide how many Ns we want according to how high we set the end of the ramp.  Sound like fun?\n\nN^2=4*cos(30)/h\nh=4*cos(30)/N^2\n(h is in units of meters)\nN   h(m)   h(inches)\n3    .385    15.15\n4    .0771   3.04\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nj",9

5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13

5,"Which college football team will wimp out this year? ; Last year, Tennessee was rated highly in the pre-season polls and didn't even get into a bowl, they were so lame.

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

""an often malevolent being that is bodiless but can become visible; specifically : GHOST 2 d : a malevolent being that enters and possesses a human being""\n\nWebster has 7 definitions for the word ghost with the first 2 being very similar to those for spirit:\n1.  the seat of life or intelligence : SOUL \n2.  a disembodied soul; especially : the soul of a dead person believed to be an inhabitant of the unseen world or to appear to the living in bodily likeness\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I refer to a ghost and rarely use the word spirit at all.",260

9,"Wat is the protectionist policy followed by US and other developed countries part of WTO? ; and why isnt free trade good for everyone? ; I am assuming you are referring to trade policy.  Protectionist policies are those that advantage domestic goods over foreign goods (exports v imports) through either tarriffs (surcharges added to the price of a good being imported) or through subsidies (price supports or distributive policies within a country) to grow or make some item.\nObviously, similiar to the micro level of a larger grocery store being able to get better prices when negotiating with its suppliers compared to a smaller chain or a 'mom & pop' type store, larger countries (typically first world) are better positioned to DICTATE supply agreements (not much can be done about demand---other than to decrease it through tarriffs (VAT) which would be passed on to the consumer).  \nThird and second world countries are often in a very tenuous position:  their government wants to expand their economy through increasing exports, however, often this is done through either internally, creating subsidies (which many cannot afford to do) or agreeing to 'lopsided' trade agreements, which wind up exploiting or at a minimum, disadvantaging their citizens and other workers in their respective countries or nations.  Additionally, there are contravening issues like human rights and environmental standards which may also be of concern.\nI hope this helps, but here are some articles for you to read and consider; as well as the WTO link",341

All the while, I keep writing very, very large cheques. Am I being unreasonable? Are there real treatments I'm missing out on? What should I ask or, or insist on, at my next visit? Many thanks!! ; Sounds liek your doctor is a quack. A relaxation CD? Well TMD is a complex disease that people don't really understand all that well but there are steps to treatment. First step is that if you grind or clench at night or in the daytime is to correct that problem. Stressing a bad joint is only going to make the problem worse. So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain. Stop ibuprofen though if it tears up your stomach. There are treatments .... and there are steps.  This guy giving you a CD and charging you money for that crap is not medicine",364

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

They will normally require at least 2-4 names so if the main one is used they have a couple of more to research.\n\nThere are a few sites that will incorporate you for less than $300.00, but you would need a Corporate Seal that you can pick up at staples. Some of the sites sell them for as low as $45.00\nYou will have to check out the add ons that you would want them to do in the forming of your corporation.\n \nIf you do not live in Nevada and you incorporate in Nevada, you may do business in Nevada. If you don't live in Nevada and you decide to do business in the state in which you live your Nevada corporation would be considered an alien Corporation in your state. You would have to pay an additional fee for your state to allow your alien Corporation to do business in your state. This fee is any where from $200.00-$600.00.\n\nThe reason people set up a corporation in Nevada is because Nevada does not give out information about the corporation officers, money earned and stuff to the IRS. If you set up business in your state with your Nevada corporation I think you lose that shield in the other state, because the corporate with the IRS.  \n\nTry this link and see if they can offer you a good deal on doing your corporation.\n\nhttp://www.clickandinc.com\n\nI hope this has been of some use to you, good luck. \n\n""FIGHT ON""",525
3,"What is the quickest way to get a degree in Nursing? ; I am interested in becoming an R.N. and I have heard it is possible to do in as little as 2 years. I would be starting from scratch (just high school diploma) Is 2 years possible? ; There are 3 ways in becoming a nurse (RN).  Diploma program, associate's degree, and bachelor's degree.  You can also become an LPN.  The diploma program and associate degree program take 2 years to complete.  However, most AD (associate's degree) programs require sciences to be completed or will put you on a wait list.  The AD program is usually offered by a community college or local college.  The diploma program is easier to get into (no wait list, no sciences prior to admission) and is offered by a hospital or adult community classes.  The LPN is usually offered through adult classes and will only take 1 year.  The advantage of becoming an LPN is that you will become a nurse in one year and can transfer to a college to then become an RN for only an additional year.  (You can work as an LPN as you study to become an RN).  So, yes it is possible for you to become an RN in 2 years.  If you are a senior now, look at all of the programs near you NOW.  You need to apply because the spots to fill up quickly.  I hope this was helpful in your quest to becoming an RN.  If you can, brush up on your sciences.",526

I have some foreign talent candidates that are interested. Is there a service to do this on your behalf or a recommended book to read.? ; Since you are new to this, you should consider retaining an immigration attorney.  The procedure is not rocket science, but requires some interaction with you state's Department of Labor (not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Labor) before you actually file the paperwork with the immigration.  \n\nLegal fees will probably run you about $2,000 per case (I've seen as low is $1,500 and as high as $5,000 with level of service completely uncorrelated to the price; a cheap lawyer can be as good or as bad as an expensive one); you will also have to pay a non-refundable filing fee of $1,500 per case to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  There may be other expenses, such as the cost of evaluating your prospective employee's education credentials (the law requires that H-1B workers hold at least a Bachelor's degree in the area of their proposed employment or a related area), but they are typically small compared to attorney fees and filing fees.  \n\nYou will be requried to post a notice to your employees about the fact that you are hiring H-1B workers and sign an affidavit stating that you in fact posted such notice.  \n\nYou should also remember that the best time to file for an H-1B is right after the beginning of the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1), so you should file in October or November.  Usually, USCIS stops accepting H-1B petitions in January or February, because the annual quota for H-1B visas gets filled.  If your attorney neglects to mention this at the initial interview (as some sleazy ones do), don't hire him; he is trying to charge you for putting together a petition that he knows full well will be rejected.\n\nIf you are in California, I can recommend a good attorney (knowledgeable, approachable, and reasonably priced) whom I have repeatedly used over the last few years.",536

4,"If somone knows your IP address, can they access your computer and know everything? ; I am curious to know, if soemone can hack into your computer and see what you were doing either online or not online? Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?

Instead, people vote for individual representatives in parliament for their district (like how we vote for Representatives), and the party that receives a majority of seats (or coalition of parties if none has a majority) votes for who among them should be prime minister.\n\nIn countries that have both, the President has very little power and is mainly a ceremonial position, much like the Queen in England.",876

1,"whats -16x squared + 80x + 3? ; i think u have to solve it by binomiels but i cant think of 2 numbers that multiple to 16 and add to 80. its a parabala and i have to graph it please help ; y = -16x^2 +80x +3\n\nFirst of all, it is a negative quadratic function, so, you expect this quadratic function to open downwards. Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943

This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950

2,"Is it healthy to lose about 3 lbs a week? ; I'm trying to lose 37 lbs in 14 weeks and I would need to lose 2.8 lbs a week.  Is this healthy or too much?  I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963

6,"Why hasn't the doubling of the price of crude oil started an economical depression? ; I remember that when the price went up by far less a few years ago it was blamed for the major depression that followed. ; Because all the people who went out and spent a ton of money on a big SUV now have to go out and spend a ton of money just to drive it. Add to that the owners of the new Hummers and you have gas guzzling taken to a new level.  This massive spending by owners of gas guzzlers will prevent any economic downturn.\n\nPoliticians will always blame things on something else, so they will shift the blame for their bad economic policy to increased oil prices, figuring Americans are too dumb and stupid to know the difference.  This is why they get away with $200 million pork barrel spending for a bridge in Alaska, bigger than the Golden Gate, to connect to a remote island where nobody lives.",987

In the months following 9/11 President Bush could have asked us to do almost anything, I think.

Most of us don't really have anything vested in it. I personally know ONE guy over there and he's not family. And that's when Bush has asked nothing from this country for the war---the money is borrowed from the Chinese, there's no rationing, no homefront commandos, no war bonds, no victory gardens, no raised taxes.  Supporting the war means paying lipservice and that's it. If you support the war it's because you also support the President and his ""spend and borrow, and it's all about me"" philosophy, which would naturally preclude actually doing something for the war effort.\n\n\n""Hmmm probably alot more than the anti war idiots, who do not have the guts to go to the middle east in person to kiss the terrorists *sses!""\n\nSweet Seductress,  that's a cheap shot.

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",1179

1,"Soil Conservation? ; CausesConsequencesSolutions\nSoil Erosion•••\nDesertification\n\nSalinization•••\n•••\n\nDescribing ways in which your lifestyle directly or indirectly contributes to Soil degradation. ; Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms (in the case of bioerosion). Although the processes may be simultaneous, erosion is to be distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock. Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n\nA certain amount of erosion is natural and in fact healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continually move downstream in watercourses. Too much erosion, however, can cause problems, clogging streams with gravel, filling reservoirs with sediment, reducing soil fertility and water\n \ncauses : What causes erosion to be severe in some areas and minor elsewhere? It is a combination of many factors, including the amount and intensity of precipitation, the texture of the soil, the gradient of the slope, ground cover (from vegetation, rocks, etc.) and land use. The first factor, rain, is the agent for erosion, but the degree of erosion is governed by other factors.\n\nThe first three factors can remain fairly constant over time. In general, given the same kind of vegetative cover, you expect areas with high-intensity precipitation, sandy or silty soils, and steep slopes to be the most erosive. Soils with a lot of clay that receive less intense precipitation and are on gentle slopes tend to erode less.\n\nThe factor that is most subject to change is the amount and type of ground cover. When fires burn an area or when vegetation is removed as part of timber operations, building a house or a road, the susceptibility of the soil to erosion is greatly increased.\n\ncontrol : Examples of some erosion control methods include:\n\nconservation tillage \ncontour plowing \ncover crops \ngabions \nhydroseeding \nreforestation \nriparian strips \nriprap \nstrip farming \nvegetated waterways \nterracing \nwattle (construction) \nwindbreaks",1267

Does anyone know why?\n\nAt first I thought it was just a weird anime character design, but I don’t think that is it.  It has to have more meaning…  Then I thought maybe it helps them fight?  Maybe they use that leg more, so the bandages might help constrain the leg from twisting it funny or stretching their muscles while fighting, so they will be less likely to get injured!  Don't know, just a thought...\n:-P\n\nAdded:\nHey, I think I know why!  Look at this picture:\nhttp://www.asylum-anime.com/pboards/naruto-0204C.jpg\nSee where the bandages are at?  He has a strap fastened around his leg, over the bandages, with a bag that holds more weapons.  So, the bandages are there to help hold the weapons in place!  I don’t know how to describe it…  \n\nBut it holds his clothes closer to him, so that it will not get in the way when he reaches for the weapons.  It also has a greater chance that the weapons will not move because the clothes will not move and possibility loosen the straps.  Also, it will help so that their legs, where they have the bag of weapons fasten to, won’t get irritated from constantly rubbing against their skin.  It gives extra padding!!!  And not all of the ninjas have the bandages on that leg!  One of the sounds group (I think it was the sounds, it was in the episode where they are in the death forest) had the bandages on the other leg.  Sasuke makes a point about this when one of them pretends they are Naruto, but has the bandages on the wrong leg!  It's because the sound guy is left handed!  Everything makes sense now!!!\n\nYea!

You need to keep lotion on them all the time. Also, make sure that when you wash your hands, you dry them completely and NEVER go outside in cold weather with wet hands!

She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

In these poorer countries, good, honest doctors are hard to come by, and even harder to afford. Many only want to save the lives of their dying loved ones. These people work long hours and do back-breaking work for a very inadequate salary. To get here, they have to pay large sums of money, and risk their lives. I know I wouldn't want to have to do that to enjoy the opportunities that I have. I don't understand why they can't be considered refugees. I know that not everybody that has migrated to the US has come for these reasons, but many have. Oh, and America makes it very hard for the latinos to immigrat legally. I costs a lot and they have to own property, and have a good job, and then they can only apply for something temporary.""Love thy neighbor as thyself.""America loved itself enough to help itself to pre-owned land\nTheir countries are full of hard workers, if only given the chance in their homelands, they could succeed. Then they wouldn't need theUS ; Look, we have laws and these laws need to be respected. It has absolutely nothing to do with the race and nationality of immigrants, and every bit to do with the right of this nation to defend itself. Moreover, as a tax-paying, skilled, and educated citizen, I think it is extremely unfair to expect only the naturalized citizens of this nation to pay all of the bills and just give everyone else a free pass. That is completely absurd. \n\nFor the record, Mexico and Japan have the strictest immigration law. If you knew what the Mexican government did to persons whom they caught illegally entering their country you would totally rethink how the US treats immigrants. \n\nAlso, our government isn't saying these people can never come to the US to live or work, we just want them to respect the law. That means filling out the forms, paying the fees, paying taxes, background checks and not breaking the law when they get here. That really isn't asking too much.",1679

1,"What Is The Material Called That Is Used To Transfer Heat Between A DC Voltage Regulator And A Heat Sink? ; It's A Grey Rubber-Like Material With Metal Fibers Interwoven Into It... ; A Thermal Interface Material (aka TIM) is used to fill the gaps between thermal transfer surfaces, such as between microprocessors and heatsinks, in order to increase thermal transfer efficiency. These gaps are normally filled with air which is a very poor conductor.\n\nThey take many forms.

When is everyone going to relize that christianity is about your own personal walk with Christ?  God gives eveybody a choice to do exactly what they want to do. So if a person wants to go to church, claim Christ as their savior, pray and then turn around and kill somebody, then they just have that choice, God didn't create robots.  You cant associate the personal choices of people with those of all christians.  That's just like saying because a white guy with a beard robbed you, then all white guys with beards are theives. If some christians judge or do wrong, then they'll have to deal with God themselves, but for a person to use that as an excuse to reject christianity is stupid.

How much money do they have together? (Assume that Nadine only has nickels and Delano only has dimes.) \n\nUse only one variable and show work ; Okay, here it goes...\n\nDelano has an amount of dimes n\nNadine has an amount of nickels equal to Delano's dime plus 7 or n + 7.\n\nThe amount of money each of them has can be represented this way.\n\nDelano 10n\nNadine 5(n +7)\n\nNow we've also been told that if Delano gives four of his dimes to Nadine that they will each have the same amount of money. If then happens then Delano will have an amount of money that is the equivalent of four dimes less that he had:\n\n10(n-4)\n\nAnd Nadine will have an amount of money equal to four dimes more than she had:\n\n5(n + 7) + 40\n\n40 being the amount of cents equal to 4 dimes\n\nSo therefore, we can create the equality:\n\n5(n + 7) + 40 = 10(n -4) or by distributive multiplication\n\n5n + 35 + 40 = 10n - 40 or by performing initial arithmetic operations\n\n5n + 75 = 10n - 40 or by adding 40 to each side\n\n5n + 115 = 10n or by subtracting 5n from each side\n\n115 = 5n therefore, if we divide each side by 5\n\n23 = n\n\nTo check this, Delano's 23 dimes would give him $2.30. Nadine would have 7 more nickels that Delano has dimes and so she would have a total of 30 nickels for a total of $1.50. If Delano gives her 4 dimes or $.40, her total will rise to $1.90 while his will fall from $2.30 to $1.90. The value checks.",1712

I am graduating from a university in 2008 with a degree in criminal justice. I am looking at one agency in particular, Diplomatic Security. Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

5,"what is rong with my fantasy baseball team? ; my team is doing terrible, please help me with trades ,adds/drops.\n\nMy team:c,R martin,c,J varitek,1b,B broussard,2b,J vidro,3b,B hall,\nss,E renteria,of,C crawford,of,C crisp,of,R johnson,of,A rios,\nu,A ramirez.Pitchers:T glavine,B howry,R lopez,D lowe,B penny,\nK rogers,B wagner,D willis.BENCH:c,D ross,3b,M ensberg. ; OK, follow me here because this is gonna take a while, but in the end I promise it will help your team a bunch if you give it a few weeks to take shape.\n\n1 catcher is all you need...you need to drop 2 and pickup a first baseman who plays EVERY DAY, I personally would keep Varitek or Ross.  Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

I need to find the good versus evil in the jehovah witness religion. for example christians have God as being good and satan as being evil. What do the Jehovah witness religion believe is good and evil. ; I think you will find that Jehovah Witnesses would have a view almost exactly like that of Christians. But they are not Christians, and they are identified as a cult because they deny that Jesus is Jehovah incarnate. They make Him out to be a created angel. Since they deny that God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, they divorce themselves from historic, biblical Christianity. But they would agree that God is good and Satan is evil, that doesn't change. \n\nSomething to be aware of though, Satan is not an equal, negative version of God. Satan was created by God. God made him, and God will judge him. Satan is evil on a short leash. \n\nBut if you want to find out about Jehovah's Witnesses, check out some of the sites that have to deal with their errors on a daily basis:\n\nhttp://www.watchman.org/jwtools.htm\n\nor\n\nhttp://www.macgregorministries.org/jehovahs_witnesses/jehovah_witness_index.html",2433

As well as the appropriate wood for an arrow. ; Hard question to answer, bud.  A simple survival bow is easy enough but I have no idea how much work you want to put into it.\n\nEasiest way to learn?  Find a good sapling approx 3-4"" in diam that's scrub.  Lop it off approx a foot above the ground and cut it so it's approx 6' long.  Lots of really good woods out there and most everyone has their fav....me I just say cut a sapling.\n\nUse a semisharp knife and a hammer and split it right down the middle from the thin end.  Do that again so you have a 1/4 trunk.  That's called a bowstave.\n\nRound off the sharpness on that triangle shape in the exact middle, but keep the triangle shape.  Starting about a foot on either side of the center point, start whittling the triangle flatter and flatter as you move out to the ends.  Always whittle the back, not the front!\n\nKeep experimenting with bending it as you whittle....so if one end bends more than the other, simply whittle a bit more on the other end til it bends approx the same.  That's called ""tillering"".  I won't get into it.\n\nOnce both ends (the limbs) bend in a good solid arc and it feels good to you, carefully notch the ends so they can hold a string.\n\nTie your string on one end and then keep bending the bow and retying the other til the tight string is approx 8"" from the back of the bow.\n\nThat's a really basic survival type bow.  You could spend years mastering each step if you wanted to really make bows, but that one will have you shooting within an hour or two and they're fun to teach the kids as a summer project.\n\nArrows....you can use the same old 1/4 trunks that you cut for the bow.  Each one will make approx four arrows.  Simply split each 1/4 stave like before and just start whittling the corners.  Keep whittling the corners until they're round.\n\nAnything I need to cover in more depth?",2482

Thanks if you can make me smarter with this bit of info :) ; C. \n\nTechnically the answer could be argued for either, so if you picked A, and it's wrong, but can give a good argument, then you may get credit for it.  A good argument would say ""The people of the nation elect a president because it is their votes that make the decision on who the state casts a vote for.  The people are a necessary part of the process of the way the electoral college is executed - de facto vs. de jure.""\n\nIf the answer is A and you picked C, then I would argue the following.

I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice.

I might get one of them. ; Dental implants vary tremendously in cost depending upon how many you will need.  Some of the answers here are wrong - very wrong.  A dental implant is better for your jaw bone and your own dental health because once the implant is properly seated in the bone it will stimulate your bone to grow just as your normal teeth stimulate the bone to grow.  \n\nI would guess you have seen little old men and or ladies who have almost now lower jaw and no teeth.  The jaw actual stopped growing new bone tissue because of the lack of stimulation for having teeth anchored to the jaw bone. \n\nHere is how they should work. You should have  a CAT scan done of your upper and lower jaw.  Depending upon where the implant is to be placed.  The dentist may want to make a surgical guide that will allow him to drill at the exact angle that is needed to the base of the implant is screwed into the correct type of bone.  This is critical because there are different  types of bone density in your jaw and you want your implant seated in the bone with the greatest density.  Once the implant is placed in your jaw bone he may or may not depending upon the opinion of the dentist  attache the final prosthetic onto the implant.

They aren't calling him an idiot as a general thing, it is calling him an idiot for making a stupid decision. Yes he is 100% within the law. That doesn't mean people don't think the law is stupid. Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head. Remember depending on the helmet they don't really go down enough to prevent a jaw from being broken.\n\nTo old school Yinz is Pittsburghese although most use yunz.\nAs to the one who commented about it being against his contract, sorry but you are mistaken.

6,"2 dollars bills? ; how come the u.s. is not making any more 2 dollars note??? ; In spite of its relatively low value, the two-dollar bill is one of the most rarely seen denominations of U.S. currency. This is partly due to the low production of the note; approximately 1% of all notes produced today are $2 bills. Two-dollar bills, unlike other denominations, are not frequently reissued in a new series. This is because bills are printed according to demand. When the Federal Reserve Banking System runs low on its current supply of $2 bills, it will submit an order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which will then print more. Demand for $2 bills is low enough that one printing can last for many years. There is still a large supply of series 1976 bills that have not been circulated.\n\nIt is still a common perception that the $2 bill is rare, and when the general public encounters them, the bills are frequently hoarded and not circulated. According to the Treasury, they ""receive many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation."" [1]. In response, the Treasury states: ""The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations. According to BEP statistics, 590,720,000 Series 1976 $2 bills were printed and as of February 28, 1999, there was $1,166,091,458 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.""",2693

I was out on a pontoon boat on a local lake that I had fished for ages.  Loads of people go out there for a fireworks show at night, but being the avid fisherman I am, I took along a few rods and a couple tackle boxes.  \n\nWhile we were out there, a few of the people I was with started asking me questions about that particular lake.  One other kid who I knew didn't fish at all and didn't know diddly squat about fishing started answering everything.  He's your stereotypical frat boy and no offense to anyone out there, but he was fishing w/ a zebco 33.  Well after a while, I realized that he answered every question w/ ""Well the only real lure on this lake is a spinnerbait.  It's the only one that works anyways.""\n\nSo I waited until he said it a few more times, and then I said loud enough for everyone to hear me, ""You fish with that spinnerbait, and I'll use a plastic worm and we'll see what happens.""\n\nThis is where it gets good...\n\nFirst cast, I flipped a black trick worm about 3 feet behind an underwater tree that had reached the surface.  I pulled it a few times kinda jerkin' it, and in the next second, BAM!  I hooked up to a 4 pounder.  In about the next hour, I had landed about 25 pounds worth of bass in 5 fish.  \n\nI've fished plenty of tournaments, and I would have killed to have been in one that day, but as they say, ______ happens.\n\nMeanwhile, spinnerbait boy is over there in the corner w/ no bites at all.  By this time the people have tuned him out when he starts talking, and I'm loving it.  Then he casts and says he had a bite.  ""I missed it, I'll get him again.""\n\nThree or four more times, the bite is in the same place, and he keeps missing it.  (I'm starting to think it's a log, weeds, rock, etc. but I didn't say anything)  On the next cast, he got to the spot where he had been getting a ""bite"" and set the hook violently.  He fought and fought and fought and said he had a big one.  ""Get the camera, this one is going to be a good one""  <== Exact words.  \n\nWell when the monster surfaced, it was about a 4 ft. stick.  Everyone kept giving him crap about it and eventually he just sat back and shut up.  From that point on, every question from anyone on the boat was directed towards me!",2719

Then double click within the second viewport and the go to View - 3d Views - Isometric (there are 4 to chose from) this will give you your isometric view. Again adjust the scale to suit.

0,"Is Bernard Lonergan more influened by his Louvain heritage than by Aquinas historically understood? ; That is to say, the Louvain tradition was commissioned by Leo XIII to answer the challenges of skepticism a la Kant. Lonergan's magnum opus ""Insight"" turns out in the end to be an argument for the existence of God. In light of Victor Preller's work on Aquinas (which argues that Aquinas's Five Proofs were not meant to prove God's existence but to show the insufficiency of such proofs), should Lonergan be understood to be proving the existence of God as a response to Cartesian and Kantian epistemologies and not (goes the implication) by faithful extension of Aquinas historically understood? ; I've only been through ""Insight"" once, and read the ""Verbum"" articles years ago, so somebody might have a more detailed answer. \n\nLonergan does seem to have a Kantian agenda, though he doesn't directly engage Kant. The Kantian question is: by what right do we make metaphysical statements, such as ""God exists."" Lonergan argues by describing the process by which we makes true statements, though not in the same manner as Kant. His approach is more empirically oriented, looking at everyday experiencing and judging (whereas Kant was interested in the validity of those judgments necessary for Newtonian physics). From this basis, he argues that metaphysical judgments are possible; thus we can give an argument that God exists. \n\nIs this a faithful extension of Aquinas? Leaving aside whether or not Aquinas was interested in proving the existence of God in the modern sense, I would say yes. In fact, much of ""Insight"" sounds to me like a standard neo-scholastic epistemology manual. It's questionable whether his ""turn to the subject"" is a move Aquinas would have made, but I don't see that there's a contradiction between being a response to modern concerns and being a faithful extension of Aquinas.",2734

The original ""gridirons"" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a ""gridiron,"" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of ""gridiron"" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.",2786

6,"someone help me? ; my teacher asked me that: how to put a elephant into a refrigerator, and after that how to put a lion into that same refrigerator\nIf someone know how, please help me\nThanks ; I smelled a rat when I heard this. Sounded like the teacher had a joke in mind, so here is the answer. It is very long. I have included a source so it is properly academic. \n------------------------------\nHow To Put An Elephant Into A Refrigerator\nAnalysis:\n1) Differentiate it and put into the refrig. Then integrate it in the refrig.\n2) Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).\n3) Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.\n\nNumber theory:\n1) First factorize, second multiply.\n2) Use induction. You can always squeeze a bit more in.\n\nAlgebra:\n1) Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig. Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.\n2) Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.\n\nTopology:\n1) Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.\n2) Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.\n3) The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.\n4) The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.\n5) The property of being inside the referigerator is hereditary. So, take the elephant's mother, cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.\n6) For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals. Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.\n\nAlgebraic topology:\nReplace the interior of the refrigerator by its universal cover, R^3.\n\nLinear algebra:\n1) Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.\n2) Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator. By linearity, x% will fit for any x.\n\nAffine geometry:\nThere is an affine transformation putting the elephant into the refrigerator.\n\nSet theory:\n1) It's very easy! refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the refrigerator both have cardinality c.\n\nGeometry:\nDeclare the following:\nAxiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.\n\nComplex analysis:\nPut the refrig. at the origin and the elephant outside the unit circle.

It's urgent!I? ; I need specifics and please back up why or how it is the lesson/ moral... or give a good argument for the purpose!! ; The ram with golden fleece was a gift from Mercury to Nephele, to get her children away from their step-mother.  (Ancient child custody issues.)  The girl drowned, but the boy was ""hospitably received"" by Aetes, King of Colchis.  The boy then sacrificed the ram to Jupiter and gave the golden fleece to his host.  He placed it in a consecrated grove with a dragon to guard it.  Eventually, Jason's uncle, who was supposed to surrender the throne of his kingdom when he reached maturity, sent him on a wild goose chase, er golden fleece quest, claiming the fleece was the rightful property of their kingdom.  Which it was not.  Anyway, Jason rounded up a tough bunch of friends of his, and off they went looking for the fleece.\n\nFrom this point on, you can substitute what you know of grail quests, for the symbols and traditions have been intermingled for centuries.

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.  Have faith that what you really need will be available to you when the need actually arrives.  Never lose hope...it is stronger than experience.  Live life!!!",2871

In astronomy, the best-known type of eclipse occurs whenever the Sun, Earth and Moon line up exactly. If this occurrence is at the time of a Full Moon where the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow, it is called a lunar eclipse. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depends upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital node. If the lining up of the Sun, Moon and Earth occurs at New Moon, the event is usually referred to as a solar eclipse (although the term is a misnomer and can more accurately be referred to as an occultation of the Sun by the Moon).",2896

9,"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity shouldn't African Americans receive also? ; Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice. ; Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm.  Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.  All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery, after all, since some immigrated to America after slavery, or since some have no slave ancestors.  It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry, and then to divide some sum proportionately.\n\nAdditionally, the vague ""400 yr+ of oppression"" is unhelpful in crafting legislation.  Slavery ended.  Segregation did exist also, that's ended for over 50 years now.  If you're problem with ""White supremacy and injustice,"" then I'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem.  Instead, educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice.",2923
9,"Why did Democrats choose the donkey for their mascot? ; Donkeys are asses and Elephants never forget. ; When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, his opponents tried to label him a ""jackass"" for his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson, however, picked up on their name calling and turned it to his own advantage by using the donkey on his campaign posters. During his presidency, the donkey was used to represent Jackson's stubbornness when he vetoed re-chartering the National Bank.\n\nThe first time the donkey was used in a political cartoon to represent the Democratic party, it was again in conjunction with Jackson. Although in 1837 Jackson was retired, he still thought of himself as the Party's leader and was shown trying to get the donkey to go where he wanted it to go. The cartoon was titled ""A Modern Baalim and his Ass"".\n\nInterestingly enough, the person credited with getting the donkey widely accepted as the Democratic party's symbol probably had no knowledge of the prior associations. Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist, came to the United States with his parents in 1840 when he was six. He first used the donkey in an 1870 Harper's Weekly cartoon to represent the ""Copperhead Press"" kicking a dead lion, symbolizing Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had recently died. Nast intended the donkey to represent an anti-war faction with whom he disagreed , but the symbol caught the public's fancy and the cartoonist continued using it to indicate some Democratic editors and newspapers.\n\nLater, Nast used the donkey to portray what he called ""Caesarism"" showing the alleged Democratic uneasiness over a possible third term for Ulysses S. Grant. In conjunction with this issue, Nast helped associate the elephant with the Republican party. Although the elephant had been connected with the Republican party in cartoons that appeared in 1860 and 1872, it was Nast's cartoon in 1874 published by Harper's Weekly that made the pachyderm stick as the Republican's symbol. A cartoon titled ""The Third Term Panic,"" showed animals representing various issues running away from a donkey wearing a lion's skin tagged ""Caesarism."" The elephant labeled ""The Republican Vote,"" was about to run into a pit containing inflation, chaos, repudiation, etc..\n\nBy 1880 the donkey was well established as a mascot for the Democratic party. A cartoon about the Garfield-Hancock campaign in the New York Daily Graphic showed the Democratic candidate mounted on a donkey, leading a procession of crusaders.\n\nOver the years, the donkey and the elephant have become the accepted symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. Although the Democrats have never officially adopted the donkey as a party symbol, we have used various donkey designs on publications over the years. The Republicans have actually adopted the elephant as their official symbol and use their design widely.\n\nThe Democrats think of the elephant as bungling, stupid, pompous and conservative -- but the Republicans think it is dignified, strong and intelligent. On the other hand, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn, silly and ridiculous -- but the Democrats claim it is humble, homely, smart, courageous and loveable.\n\nAdlai Stevenson provided one of the most clever descriptions of the Republican's symbol when he said, ""The elephant has a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by grasping the tail of its predecessor.""",2931

Does anyone know what I can do? ; Yes.If they've gone to collections or an attorney then they're on your report(s) and marked key derogatory or 30,60,90,120 days late.Sometimes the creditor will sell these written off accounts to resurgent companies.At that point you should contact the resurgent company and dispute with all three bureaus.\nOnce you dispute an account that's sold or written off the creditor has no claim to it anymore and will not reply to the dispute.Then the bureaus will remove the information.I did this very same thing and am paying Capital Management only 2477.00 back on 7079.00.They buy these accounts for just a few cents on the dollar and don't report to the bureaus.Resurgent companies don't want your credit ruined.\nBankruptcy is the very last resort.It screws up your credit almost as badly,and yes these bankruptcies go on your reports.\nBarring any of this contact an agency(like the ones you see commercials for) and they can help reduce your payments.I have to do this with my evil ex-wife because I unknowingly married into 27,000.00 of credit card debt.I think we used Credit Guard but I try to think of that experience as little as my failed marriage",3005

We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

I have reason to believe this is a hardware problem. The manufacturer, however, says they can not be sure that it is not a software problem, that one or more of my Windows files could be corrupted. They say if I send the computer in for service the first thing they will do is reformat the hard disk. To me this is like shooting the side of a barn with a cannon.

When this person reads all of them, the last one will have your picture glued on it and a place where they can meet you. You could leave a number as well. \n\nOr you could just walk up to this person and say, ""I'd like to go out with you as soon as possible"". This would require some balls but it would be worth it.\n\nOr you could get six of your friends together, tell each one to say one of the following words in order: ""will you go out with (your name)""? Get them to walk by this person, one after the other, each giving this person a rose when they walk by. That will commmand attention.\n\nIf this person doesn't know who you are or asks who you are, that would be your cue to pop out from some where with a rose and introduce yourself. \n\nWell, that was all could think of, off the top of my head.

It's your life and you are only trying to better it!\n\nGood luck :)\n\nP.S......... purchasing a house sans marriage has absolutely NOTHING to do with who gets what should you seperate prior to getting married.  How you take title DOES!!  Should you purchase the home prior to marriage, you would each take title in your individual name, then after each of your names, you would state ""single man"" and ""single woman"" (assuming neither of you has been married before.  If either of you has been married before, then after that person's name it would say, ""unmarried man/woman"".  You would then have to decide that should one of you die before the other whether or not you want to leave your share of the house to the other person OR to someone else.  I'll give you an example of each:\n\nThis would be if both have never been married before AND want to leave the house to the surviving partner:\n\nJonh Doe- single man and Suzie Smith-single woman as joint tenants.\n\nNow if each of you would prefer to leave your half of the house to someone else, this is how you would take title (again, assuming neither of you has been married):\n\nJohn Doe-single man  (list his percentage of ownership) and Suzie Smith-single woman (list her percentage of ownership) with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this case, you would state in a will or trust or even on a notorized piece of paper, ""who"" your percentage of the house goes to.

1,"How come when it rains, some times there's thunder and lightening with the rain and sometimes there's not? ; And how come sometimes there's wind with the rain and some times there's not? ; Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth. At the same time, it also is one of the least understood. While lightning is simply a gigantic spark of static electricity (the same kind of electricity that sometimes shocks you when you touch a doorknob), scientists do not have a complete grasp on how it works, or how it interacts with solar flares impacting the upper atmosphere or the earth's electromagnetic field.\nLightning has been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes. However, it is most often seen in thunderstorms.At any given moment, there can be as many as 2,000 thunderstorms occurring across the globe. This translates to more than 14.5 MILLION storms each year. NASA satellite research indicated these storms produce lightning flashes about 40 times a second worldwide.This is a change from the commonly accepted value of 100 flashes per second which was an estimate from 1925. Whether it is 40, 100, or somewhere in between, we live on an electrified planet.\n\nThe Sound of Thunder\nRegardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000°F (30,000°C), a temperature that is five times the surface of the sun! When lightning occurs, it heats the air surrounding its channel to that same incredible temperature in a fraction of a second.\n\nLike all gases, when air molecules are heated, they expand. The faster they are heated, the faster their rate of expansion. But when air is heated to 54,000°F in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon known as ""explosive expansion"" occurs. This is where air expands so rapidly that it compresses the air in front of it, forming a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. Exploding fireworks produce a similar result.\n\nWhat is the difference between a thundershower and a thunderstorm?  \nTechnically, there is none. In general, the term ""thundershower"" tends to denote a fairly weak storm with light to moderate rainfall and low levels of lightning activity. However, there are no defined parameters that distinguish between a thundershower and a thunderstorm. In fact, in order to avoid confusion, we in the National Weather Service do not use the term ""thundershower"". If a shower is strong enough to produce lightning, even just one single bolt, it's called a thunderstorm.\n\nTo Learn More about Lightning and Thunder go to \nhttp://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_intro.htm\n\nLIGHTNING SAFETY A MUST READ\nLightning is the MOST UNDERRATED weather hazard. On average, only floods kill more people. Lightning makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts.\n\nIn the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes COMBINED. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nLightning is one of the most capricious and unpredictable characteristics of a thunderstorm. Because of this, no one can guarantee an individual or group absolute protection from lightning. However, knowing and following proven lightning safety guidelines can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death. Remember, YOU are ultimately responsible for your personal safety, and should take appropriate action when threatened by lightning.\n\nWhile no place is 100% safe from lightning, some places are much safer than others.\nWhere to Go Where NOT to Go \nThe safest location during a thunderstorm is inside a large enclosed structure with plumbing and electrical wiring. These include shopping centers, schools, office buildings, and private residences.\n\nIf lightning st",3565

5,"Difference between soft ground and firm ground cleats? ; I'm in need of new soccer cleats and have become curious about this question. ; Soft ground boots come with replacable studs (usually 6 per boot).  These studs can be metal or plastic and screw into the bottom of the boot sole.\n\nFirm ground boots come with the studs already molded (usually 13) on the sole of the boot.  They can be small studs or in case of the newer boots nowadays, blades.\n\nUnless you are playing at an elite level, where you are playing on very good grass pitches that are properly maintained and watered, it is probably a waste of time buying '6 studs'.  Best to stick with the molded boots.\n\nKeep in mind too that if you play in a climate where rain is quite frequent (UK, etc.) it might be better to buy the 6 studs as you will be playing the majority of your games in those conditions.\n\nBest solution, if you can afford it, is buy a pair of each.\n\n:)",3676

(I know that it is from this medication because it says so on the side of the bottle.)\n\nHow long are these side effects suppose to last?\n\nIf I'm supposed to have these for the duration of the treatment, is there a way to lessen their effects? ; With regards to dizziness, it has been my observation of my own response that there are two different conditions. One is almost always postural and is benign. Being attentive to the possibility of dizziness, light-headed, fainting, and blacking out with change of position plus insuring adequate hydration and some salt intake is usually all that is necessary.\n\nIf you salt your food to taste and eat any processed foods, you should be getting enough sodium. \n\nSome folks have reported they were able to increase their very low blood pressure by increasing their fluid intake (6-8 cups per day of any fluids is usually enough) to maintain adequate hydration and increasing their salt intake. Foods that are canned, pickled, processed or cured are high in salt. You can also drink 1/4 tsp of salt in a large glass of water to increase sodium.\n\nAlso, I would strongly advise you to stay away from Gatorade for I do not recommend the use of Gatorade or similar products. Even the ones that are low in sugar contain extra potassium which you may not need. \n\npaaatches --Discussing your concerns with you physician is a must.

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

Flyer should have their hands on the bases shoulders, elbows out, and shoulders square.  The backspot then grabs the back of the flyers ankles and counts off 1,2 - on two, everyone bounces once, and then throws the flyer in the air.  This gets more height because it allows the flyer to push off better instead of relying on the bases to throw her up in the air right away.\n\nEasy stunts for small girls could include small pyramids or small lifts without a backspot.  Take two bases and a flyer.  Set up one base in a pocket (deep lunge) and another across from her in a prep stance (bent knees, straight back, hands together with palms facing up.)  With both hands on the bases shoulders, the flyer sets one foot in the pocket and bounces into the other bases prep stance.

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199
0,"What does it mean to be Emo? ; Can someone explain it to me. What would someone look like or what activies would they do? Can someone define it. I am a 31 year old housewife and i don't know exactly what this term means. ; Emo is short for emotional.  Now, in the society today, it has turned into a high school stereotype such as jocks, nerds, geeks, goths, and groups like that.  If someone were to be stereotyped as emo, they would generally keep to themselves, be more timid than others, and not really want to do anything about it.  The majority of kids who fit this stereotype generally like to listen to music.  They feel it helps them escape the stresses of reality.  Music has essentially become their anti-drug.  Most kids have jumped into this fad thinking it's cool for guys to wear girl pants and wear black and such, but hey, if they want to express themselves like that, more power to them.  Everyone, to an extent, is ""emo,"" considering it is derived from the word emotional, and if you're not emotional, you're not human.  \n\nLooks:  \n\n""Emo"" girls tend to have shorter hair with sweeping bangs that cover one eye.  \n\nGuys tend to wear tighter jeans with the same hair cut.\n\nPiercings on the face are usually a big thing.

Also where in their bodies do they make the webs?  Do you know what kind they might be? ; Many different types of tree-leaf feeding caterpillars do this; there are at least two reasons. As forex says - if a predator, like a spider, approaches, some species drop on a line of silk to avoid getting eaten. At other times and with other types of caterpillars, they dangle on a line because they're ready to turn into moths. They need a safer place to make a cocoon and pupate so they dangle until it feels right and then, hopefully, the wind will blow them into a lower, warmer and safer place to spend the winter in their cocoon. In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look. They spin silk from modified salivary glands which secrete a strong, elastic thread through spinnerets right next to their mouths; it’s similar to spider silk but their own recipe.",4300

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

Since your son's eyelashes are full of a crusty discharge it is likely that the cause is bacterial and will need an antibiotic eye drop.

2,"Erosive Esphogas? ; What is erosive esphogas and what are the symtoms? ; Erosive Esophagitis\n\nErosive esophagitis is a condition in which areas of the esophageal lining are inflamed and worn away.\n\nThe most common cause of erosive esophagitis is chronic acid reflux. Corrosive substances, such as cleaning solutions, can erode the esophagus if they are swallowed accidentally or deliberately, as in a suicide attempt. Some pills (for example, aspirinSome Trade Names\nECOTRIN\nASPERGUM\nor other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alendronateSome Trade Names\nFOSAMAX\n, doxycyclineSome Trade Names\nVIBRAMYCIN\n, and certain large iron and potassium tablets) can cause painful erosions if they lodge temporarily in the esophagus.\n\nDiagnosis of erosive esophagitis is made by esophagoscopy. If an erosion results from a pill, the pill usually can be washed down with large quantities of water; the pain often resolves within hours. Rarely, erosions caused by corrosive substances or pills persist, leading to narrowing of the esophagus.",4445

2,"is Ginkgo a good herbal suplement? ; has any one tried this before? ; Medical uses\nThe extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nOut of the many conflicting research results, there seem to be basically three effects of Ginkgo extract on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals (antioxidant); and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders. Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication.\n\n Side effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ginkgo should also not be used by people who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women without first consulting a doctor.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include: possible increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, and restlessness.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced consumption should be halted immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40–200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nAnd that's My Best Answer!",4465

I do not have anything against people from my country, but I do believe that if people come here they should embrace the americamn culture and its good values.

1,"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical(china syndrome) would it actually melt it's way to china? ; This is prob a stupid question, I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome. ; All nuclear plants that are producing power must be ""critical.""  The plant is shut down when it is ""subcritical.""  A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes ""supercritical.""  A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it.  A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world (like anything else that falls).  Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe, the core would fall toward China, thus the China syndrome.  Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth.  For those with a wild imagination, China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core.  None-the-less, China Syndrome is a catchy phrase.",4732
2,"Is there anyone who is suffering from Phobia or how u get recover from that?  Your answer is mostly appreciate ; Looking forwards to hear from you, for I need ur support! ; I feel sorry for your anxiety caused by your phobia and for the other people writing about their phobias in your answer column. I to have suffered with many different phobias; as a child it was injections (both dentists and doctors), and Dogs; now it is the feeling of fear itself that I fear. (Because of years of panic attacks)\n\nI can tell you what helps, if you need to take an oral pill (tranquilizer) if you are really bad (one every night before going to bed for a short time) or (half an hour before you need to go to the doctor for an appointment involving an injection). \n*However this will not teach you too become brave or help you cope with your underlining fear which has become a phobia. \n\nI suggest you learn to relax through different sources.\n\nFirstly you can do positive self talk as your fear comes from negative thoughts causing you to have a chemical release in the brain which in turn causes the physical sensations of heart racing, sweating, feelings of faintness, fear, anxiety, nausea, light headedness, numbness, and so on…..oh yeah feelings of unreality is another one.\n\nNext learn relaxation or meditation either through physical participation in yoga classes or by listening to these sorts of cd, tape, or videos. There are hypnotic and relaxation available through JB Hi Fi stores designed to relax and strengthen your subconscious.  Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.  However this option is the most expensive and time consuming because it takes many sessions and time to feel you can trust or open up fully to another person.\n\n\n\n*If you use drugs as a crutch you can become addicted and that would start a whole new problem. \nP.S. the side affects of many tranquilizer drugs are feelings of anxiety and panic which you don’t want anyway.\n\n*The body is affected the same with legal and illicit drugs (downers or relaxants) like tranquillizers, sleeping pills or (marijuana, heroin, and alcohol) \n*Stimulants which are (speed, & cocaine) (cigarettes = nicotine), (tea & coffee =caffeine), and (ice & ecstasy which is often a combination of both stimulants and relaxants). \n*Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Marijuana are most accepted by the general public however they cause the most disease related deaths. Through internal organ diseases, like *Cancers and Blood clots (causing amputations, strokes and heart attacks) \n*Lung diseases from asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer.  \n*Liver diseases from damage trying to alienate the body of toxic poisons and chemicals associated with medications and alcohol over years. \n*Hepatitis, sclerosis, and cancers of the liver.  \n*Marijuana has a chemical THC which our body has receptor in our brain and we also store for long periods in our blood and fat cells; (up to one month each time you smoke just one joint). Regular bong smokers and users will cause many different chronic health problems including lung disease (as the same toxic chemicals are in tobacco and marijuana excepting nicotine which is a stimulant) mental health suffers with paranoia, anxiety, fear, loss of memory, loss of appetite or increased appetite for sweets, loss of motivation, poor health, poor sleeping patterns and a dependency to use marijuana to get to sleep. Personal hygiene problems like sweating, bad breath and rotting teeth and the best for last you only feel mellow for a short time the rest of the time you are short tempered and unbearable to be around.\n*All drugs both legal and illicit have one thing in common the same side affects which is anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.",4735

5,"facts about javelen? ; history ; Javelin throw\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nA high school athlete throwing the javelin.The javelin throw is an athletics (track and field) throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fibreglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber. Because of its potential danger, it is not always included in track and field meets; for instance, Michigan high school track and field does not include javelin.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Competition and throws \n2 Javelin redesigns \n3 History and the javelin at the Olympics \n4 World records \n5 Famous Javelin Throwers \n5.1 Women \n5.2 Men \n5.3 Top Ten longest throwers of all time (current 1986 model)- men \n \n\n\n[edit]\nCompetition and throws\nRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws or six when they are placed to the eighth position, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimeter. The javelin's point must touch the ground first for the throw to be legal. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface from which they must release the javelin. The run-up culminates in a 40 degree fan emanating from a point 8m behind the line. Throws are measured from the point of landing to the inside of the painted line with the measuring tape co-linear with the point of landing and the focal point of the fan. Javelin throwers also normally use spikes unlike other throwers, with eleven small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.\n\nJavelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more similar physical characteristics to those athletes rather than the bulky frames of the strength throwers. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 70 mph (113 km/h).\n\n[edit]\nJavelin redesigns\nIn 1986, the men's javelin (800 g) was redesigned because of the prodigious distances being thrown culminating in a world record throw of over 104m by the then East German thrower, Uwe Höhn. The javelin throw was in danger of being banished to outside the arena on safety grounds so the javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved further away from the centre of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act) so that the javelin had a downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% and also causing the javelin to stick in. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g) was similarly redesigned.\n\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.\n\n[edit]\nHistory and the javelin at the Olympics\nThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1908. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. The objective there, however was to throw at a target rather than for distance.\n\n[edit]\nWorld records\nThe world record for men, at 98.48 meters, is held by Jan Železný from the Czech Republic, set at Jena, Germany, on May 25, 1996. The world record for women, at 71.70 meters, is held by Osleidys Menéndez from Cuba, set at Helsinki, Fi",4760

5,"Any Ideas On What To Do On The Weekends With Your Husband And 5 Month Baby When It Is .? ; LIKE GOING TO THE ZOO,SHOPPING,ECT. ; A five month old wouldn't enjoy the zoo, but if you want to go, five months is a good time if the baby can sleep in a stroller. If your little one must take a nap in her/his crib, then forgo the long outing. Five month old babies are amused by anything, as you know, but only in small doses. I think you should try to find local places that take only a short drive to and from - that way you maximize your time at the place you want to be, and your baby probably won't fall asleep in the car on the way back if it's a short trip. I recommend just staying in your yard (if you have one) and playing or gardening; there are lots of things outside that would interest a five month old. Buy a bag of rice and dump it in a bowl; let him/her mess around with it outside, then hose it away when s/he is done. Buy a flat of cheap annuals along with whatever other flowers/vegetables you would like to grow; give your baby a clump of flowers (minus much of the soil) and let him destroy them (it's a great learning experience).

Once you start on the medication that has been prescribed for you, DO NOT STOP TAKING IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL GOOD!!!! That is one of the biggest mistakes i have seen by patients over the years.

0,"Is there a word in Japanese that sounds like ""quantify?""  If so, what does it mean? ; My boss made a presentation to a group of Japanese people.  Everytime he said ""quantify,"" they would giggle.  Does it sound like something in Japanese? ; This is a tough one.  How does your boss pronounce the word?\n\nOften, people change the ""t"" in ""quantify"" to a softer ""d"" sound so it sounds like ""kwandifai.""\n\nOthers leave it out entirely so it sounds like ""kwannifai.""\n\nIn both cases, they start with kwan, which sounds to me like ""kuwan"" an informal form of the verb ""kuu"" which means to eat.  To eat is usually translated to ""taberu"" but ""kuu"" has a baser hungrier meaning.  That sounds giggle-worthy to me.  :-)\n\nThere aren't any words that are close to ""nifai"", but ""fai"" by itself is close to ""faibu"" (the final bu is not always very loud), which means ""five.""\n\nI remember a similar incident while I was teaching English at a Japanese Junior High and every time I said ""Ready, set, GO!""  the class would giggle.  It turned out that the rhythym of the words was very similar to a slogan for a popular moth repellant on TV that went ""Tansu ni GON!""  \n\nI didn't think it was funny / similar at the time, but something like that could have been going on their heads.  It could be a way to initiate some conversation with members of the group, if that is still possible.  After all, shared experiences are a good foundation for a lasting relationship.",4917
3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, isotretinoin acts by inhibition of sebaceous gland function and keratinization. This retinoic acid derivative is also used to treat other skin diseases, although it is known to cause birth defects in humans and should be used with extreme caution (preferably not at all) during pregnancy. \n\nSide effects are not common, but include chest pain, dizziness, fast heartbeat (more common for injection), and skin rash.\n \ncc",4971

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness. It is often brought on by stressful situations, such as relationship difficulties, health problems, the aftermath of an accident or the death of a loved one. \n\nThe mental illness known as a ""nervous breakdown"" may also be something like panic attacks, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder. \n\nSurveys show that about one-third of Americans feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown at some point. Studies estimate that 50-million Americans suffer some form of mental illness in their lifetime. \n\nThere are many disorders that can fit within the criteria of ""Nervous Breakdown"", but those that most commonly occur are those related to:\n•Anxiety \noGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \noPanic Disorder \n•Panic Attacks \n•Trauma Disorders \noPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder \noAcute Stress Disorder \n•Psychotic Disorders \noSchizophrenia \n•Mood (Affective) Disorders \noDepression \noBipolar Disorder",5073

It’s been a month and she hasn’t really kept in touch at all, not like she used to. Any ideas on what her intentions were and what the heck she is thinking now? Thanks gals, I appreiciate it ; Well she may be moving on she already stated she don't want a long distance relationship, and know that you have a ""girlfriend"" she may be trying to find her own that pause mean she has been dating but nothing serious.  But you opened up the possibility she can find someone too. You guys are good friends but I think the time isn't right for the both of you.  Not to say if you visit her she want come see you or vice versa, but i don't know what's going on in HER mind she would have to tell you that and just ask ! Email her and ask her for her honest opinion if you want more from her then you both can come to an agreement of what this relationship is truly going to be just friends or lovers!!!",5136

1,"Does blood plasma contain oxygen or fibrin protein? ; This question was on my exam today. I looked it up but still not sure. Oxygen is insoluble in water and plasma is made up of 90% water. Also fibrin is a substance converted from fibrinogen protein. If fibrinogen protein is in plasma, does this mean that fibrin protein is in blood plasma? The question on the exam asked what was NOT in plasma: oxygen, fibrin protein, antibody, or electrolyte? ; Plasma contains a very small fraction of oxygen.Almost all oxygen is loaded in the RBC.Fibrinogen has to be converted into fibrin and this is possible when the platelets rupture to release thrombokinase.This enzyme converts prothrombin into thrombin which acts upon firbrinogen to convert it into fibrin.However this is dangerous as much of fibrin in the plasma will block the flow of blood in the  blood vessel.The blood clot is bunch of fibrin molecules. Clotting inside the blood vessels is called thrombosis.",5161
5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.  Many people thought they'd fall apart once they lost Mulder and Hudson, but they keep contending.",5172

The symptoms have continued ever since. I seem to be in a constant state of decline regarding my mood - how do I determine wether it is really S.A.D. and not just regular depression? It doesn't seem to occur at particular times of year, and I'm not sure if an overcast day affects it or not, I live in a rainy city so it's overcast a lot. Was the doctor wrong? ; You can have symptoms of depression with SAD even in summer months if it is overcast.  People who live in areas of the world that only get sun for limited times during the day or year can sometimes experience the symptoms year round.  A common treatment for SAD, in addition to meds, is to give the person a light source for the home that mimics the sun's rays.  Have you ever tried this?

Shortly after, in September 2001, he inked a new seven-figure deal with ABC to develop a series for the 2002-2003 television season, but once again, the deal failed to produce a series. Later, in 2002, he turned down the chance to play the lead in ""CSI:Miami"" and backed out of the lead role in ""Boomtown"" at the last minute. In 2004 he was attached to star in a Jerry Bruckheimer produced drama for NBC called ""City of Dreams"" as an L.A. private investigator who caters to the rich and famous. However, script problems eventually caused that project to be scrapped. Finally, in August 2004 he inked a deal to join the cast of ""The West Wing"" for the 2004-2005 season, and a few weeks later, made a separate deal with ABC and Touchstone studios to develop and star in a new series after his time on ""The West Wing.""\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal quotes \n""They'd say, 'Explain this again: If you finish this degree, you'll be able to teach high-school drama?'"" -- Former ""NYPD Blue"" on his parents' reaction after he told them he wanted to be an actor - USA Weekend (August 1999)\n\n""Celebrity hits like a bomb.

0,"Apologetics, No. 4:  If we all evolved then why are there still apes? ; This is a common question asked by people who are not familiar with the concept of evolution.\n\nThe evidence from the fossil record, from genetics, from molecular biology and so on, is that we are a species of ape, closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas, less closely related to other primates, less closely still to other mammals, and so on.  The reason that there are still other apes is that they and we had a common ancestor several million years ago.  Chimpanzees, for example, have evolved just as much in the intervening time as we have - Biologists do not say that chimps or monkeys we see today are our ancestors, as is sometimes mistakenly claimed.\n\nHence the ""why are there still apes?"" question is invalid, and due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nAgreed? ; Yep. I totally agree that it is due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nI once was told, as an example of why evolution was faulty, that ""you cannot put a typewriter into a closet and open up the door a few days later and expect it to be a computer"". I remember explaining the relationship between the computer and typewriter and that the ideas, concepts, etc that the technology did evolve, but that certain elements of the typewriter were carried over to the computer (like the keyboard and how it is styled).

Go with a natural fit, don't force yourself to try and love computers just because you think it's the most successful route. After you have that hammered out, find out what is in demand in your area or someplace that you want to move (yes, there are unemployed engineers with skills that don't fit the location). An easy way to do this is look at some of the job boards and find out what types of engineers people are hiring. \n\nPicking a school: this is VERY important.

Don't waste your time and money! \n\nOk, you picked a school, great! At this point, there are 3 things you need to do: 1. keep your GPA over 3.2. 2.

5,"What can be done to fix the BCS? ; The BCS is the biggest crock ever conceived. As of the Week 12 ranking, there are some inexplicable rankings. USC: 3rd? I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th). Furthermore, the Pac-10 as a league is laughable, they have one or two powerhouses that basically play scrimmages for a season and have an easy roll into the BCS bids. Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid. A playoff system needs to be established to discover a true champion, maybe use the bowl games as the playoffs leading to an ""Uber"" bowl game. Preferences should cease being given to bigger schools, both in rankings and officiating, by my count USC should've lost at least 2 other times.

PLEASE HELP! ; I don't know what Php mean.. I guess you are somewhere outside of the United States.\n\nAnyway, let me explain what an investment in a life policy is. First, this investment is not for your retirement. This investment is known as a ""cash value"" in the life insurance industry. If you wanted to use it anytime, you will have to borrow it and pay back with interest. This interest does not go back into your investment, but rather kept by the insurance company. If you miss any premiums or decide to stop paying in the future, the insurance company will use your cash value to pay for it. When you die, you will lose all cash value and your family will only get the death benefit.\n\nWhat I would do? Buy a 30 year term policy with Php500,000 coverage. You said you want to invest in real estate. You may do that, but I recommend investing in mutual funds too. When your term policy expires, you probably won't need life insurance if you invest wisely and continue to put away money each month.",5548

At the level I'm at, I am able to blow away batters and strike out 7-10 a game, but I want to be able ot play in college. ; First off you have good height strong upper body helps but pitching is 30% body strength 70% technique ask yourself these questions \n\n1.do i have good balance from the point of my rotation into my stride.\n\n2.am I using full arm motion = on a 360 degree scale wich means are you releasing the ball at the top point into your stretch.\n\n3.you say you have long legs that is a good tool for alot of pitchers. question from me to you. So I can be a bit more helpful . After you go into your stretch from the wind up what is the position of your trail leg into your stretch do have a habbit of pushing off the mound . Not good gets you into bad habbits .Its more like a pulling off the mound into the stride then pushing into the release . \nA good practice for this is stand at the mound go into your routine simulate your movements to the place go step by step every motion check your body position into each step. Break it down steps 1 to 5  \n\n1.your starting stance Check your balance \n2.your raise into your windup check balance look at your footing \n\n3. from windup into your stride check balance arm position did you get proper waist rotation did you push off the mound. \n\n4 look at your arm are you at your right release point .is it in correct position if not at a perfect point gonna cause loss of velocity and cause improper control of the pitch.\n\n5 check your balance after the stretch do you still have proper balance.\n \n\n\ncauses balance issues and takes away from your volicity and has a tendency of causing alot of wild pitches. Do you see  \n  yourself with this problem?\n\nThe leg kick is a tool but if you dont have balance from the kick to the stride your wasting your time .\n\n4. Do you have proper waist rotation going from windup to the stretch this is important. (note) proper hip motion=rotation) if your not balanced going from your turn into the stride this will cause a potential  loss of velocity thats where alot of power pitchers    get this down to tee.\n\nYou say you have a 3qtr arm slot question when you release the ball at what point of your stride are you release what is your arm position .Always release the ball at the top of you stride Balance+  release point = velocity .I hope this gives you some ideas on  where your at or where you need to be at .Please feal free to e-mail question's if you have any .Id be glad to help",5578

1,"What came first, the chicken or the egg? and why? ; must be the chicken ; In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.\n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.\n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.",5797

6,"How to program a vending maching for foreign currencies? ; I wonder how I can set up vendind machines so that they can accept currencies other than americans coins or bills ; There would be two problems - getting readers that count the foreign currency, and getting up-to-date conversion rates sent to it, so that you con't get cheated by currency rates changing.\n\nYou'd have to set it up so that it either gets an update once per day, say, or like an ATM, it would 'phone home' for every transaction to verify rates.  A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.  It would be cool to select an item and just start feeding in all those different currencies until the item is paid for, and it spits out change in Dollars or something.  This would make displaying prices difficult, since you are using several currencies to pay for an item, but this would be a valuable thing to have in airports around the world.\n\nInteresting idea.",5917

1,"How astronomer measure the distance between galaxies? ; If a galaxy is 50 million light years from earth, it means it takes 50 years for light to travel from the galaxy to earth. How astronomer knows the light from a galaxy is 50 million years old? ; By the red shifts of the measurement. Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

I can try Rue Care Oil that not only treat the hemorrhoids but also helps to straighten the veins and can be used for this purpose after the surgery to help hemorrhoids from re-appearing. Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

Rank them from easiest to hardest to pay off based on total owed, minimum payment due, and (tiebreaker) highest interest rates.\n\n2. While making minimum payments to all other debts, pay this one, PLUS as much extra as you can swing- AT LEAST an extra 10%, but the more the better!\n\n3. As soon as this one is paid off, apply all of the payments you WERE making on it to the next debt in line, WHILE still paying the amount on it you were. By this time, you should be paying about twice the minimum so this one will go faster.\n\n4. Repeat for each other debt- the monthly payment will be getting bigger and bigger, paying it off faster and faster.\n\n5. Throw whatever 'windfalls' you can at this also- tax returns, bonuses, etc.\n\nThey say the snowball will get you debt free in the quickest amount of time- even faster than consolidation loans, etc. One nice thing about it is that YOU are in control of it.

I've got a 2.4 Ghz Skt. 754 Athlon 64, and a dual-core 2.2 Ghz Skt. 939 based system.  Before I overclocked the Skt. 939, it was slower than the Skt. 754.  Well, it was slower using ALMOST all software.  The Skt. 939 dual-core was considerably faster while using software that was multi-processor enabled, of course.\n\nThe biggest difference between the two will be if you're using the systems for gaming.  Nearly all Skt 754 motherboards are AGP based, and the few that had PCI-E slots weren't very good.  With Skt 939, you can spend alot of money on a really nice PCI-E video card, and will be able to play games like never before, if you spend enough.",6154
3,"I have a report on to kill a mokingbird (see below for details)? ; I have a report on Mrs. Dubose's characteristics in To Kill a Mockingbird. Can someone give me all the traits and details? It is due tommorow \n\nPLEASE HELP ; summary:\n\nScout (Jean Louise) Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama county of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris (Dill), who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside in daylight.\n\nScout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ black cook, takes them to the local black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAtticus’s sister, Alexandria, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem, Dill, and Scout, who snuck out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death (though it might be that he tried to escape so he could get shot deliberately because he wanted to die looking like a hero. However, in the book, it is said that he could've escaped if he had two good arms instead of one). In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a halloween pageant at their school. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children. Atticus at first believes that Jem fatally stabbed Mr. Ewell in the struggle. ",6166

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

They can pretty much condition the lease on anything they can find enough renters to agree to. \n\nNow, renters insurance isn't terribly expensive, and has benefits to you and the landlord.  I suspect it's going to cost you about $15 per month, get a quote somewhere.  Look at it as if it were a rent increase, and make your decision whether to accept it or not. \n\nWhat renters insurance does for them is protect against damage done to their place by your pets, or a fire you cause, some other things.  What it does for you is protect you if a guest of yours is injured on your property, cover your belongings if there's a fire or burglary, some other things.  \n\nThey sell renters insurance to a lot of people that aren't required to have it by their lease.

4,"i have a virus problem an somebody help me? ; i am 13 years old and my father is a verybad man and i dont have any money to pay an antivirus program . I need a free full antivirus or antispyware because i am infested with the Trojan virus i scanned the computer with the NOD32,Adware-SE and Spyware Blaster but no succes.When i start the windos explorer i dont see my default page, i see a website safety security or something like that and he told me that i have a virus and i have files exposed on the internet such as System32,Program files and other files.They said that i need some update or patch but it doesnt work yesterday i tried to download the update but it says that Page cannot be displayed. what should i do i need to get this virus out of my computer but how? ; First of all, one of the easiest wey to stop online attacks is, STOP USING INTERNET EXPLORER. Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

Do you have any suggestions that I could pass along? The boys are only five and six. ; Try taking the advice given here. Be prepared to march down to the school a lot to try to get this taken care of. Your grandkids CAN learn! Then, if none of that works, consider homeschooling, or have the parents consider homeschooling, whichever is more appropriate. Like some of these teachers said, they are trained to educate regular student, not special children. I know a boy with FAS and a myriad of other diagnoses, and when he was eight years old, he snuck out of a locked campus and was halfway home before his grandma was called and told he was missing. He had walked about five miles. Homeschooling gives you the advantage of knowing your grandson's individual problems. There are so many different types of problems going on in a special ed class, that I don't blame the teacher for being overwhelmed. Most special ed kids excel once they start being taught at home because they are in an environment they know, with loving caregivers who understand the complexities of their own disorders, and are able to work at their own pace. There's no distractions like there are in a classroom. It just seems to work. There are several place you can turn to to learn about homeschooling kids with special needs. Check yahoo groups, there's a lot. I'm on HS-Plus, and it's a really good group. Lots of different disorders being dealt with, FAE/FAS is a big one, so you'd get lots of help.

Do you think time can be thought of in terms of a straight line or is it a circle.  No beginning and no end. ; By definition, the big-bang is the beginning of the known universe; that is to say: everything that can be known is from after the big-bang. And so, implicitly your question is answered – time started with the big-bang, simply because we can not find any proof of it’s existence before. (I know, it is a little confusing.)\n\nAs to time’s linearity –\nI’ll start with a different difficult concept – infinity. \nDraw a square grid. Stretch it to infinity. ALL of its edges are now at infinity. In any direction you choose to move, you will eventually reach infinity. The same word describes your location no matter where you are. If all these places are denoted by one word-symbol-number, than all these places are one!\nGauss was first to visualize this: take your infinite grid and wrap it around a sphere with a radius of one that rests at its origin. The point (0,0) would become a southern pole, the point we called infinity would become the northern pole. \nAny infinite straight line would become a circle when drawn on this sphere grid. \n\nNow I’ll give you back your question: what do you think is the shape of the time line?",6764

Exercising WHILE you have the cramps only makes them worse-- trust me, I had that problem when I was 18 (at first the doc thought it might be a cyst, but then I just started working out all the time because of a school activity, and I am 21 now, still work out regularly, haven't had them since).  And you said cheaply-- exercise is free!\n\nBut speaking of cysts, it could be one of those.  My friend's sister had killer cramps, and it turned out that a cyst was the reason.

5,"What is the top scuba gear for 2005 for the following items...? ; Mask\nFins\nTorch\nWetsuit\nRegulator\nOther gadgets worth mentioning? ; A mask is all about the fit.  A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.  My preference is the Apollo bio fins although there are many excellent choices out there.\n\nIn terms of torch, I think that depends on your application.  I like the Ikelite PCA, the UK SL4 and the small UK pocket light.  These would work for tropical night diving.  Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.  I really like the scubapros but there are *many* great choices.

1,"Does the full moon affect the speed of the earth's rotation? ; Can the moon's effect on gravity and tides vary or affect the speed of the earth's rotation i.e. speed it up/slow it down ever so slightly during monthly moon phases? If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time. Of all of these Stephen Hawking's were the easiest for me to understand and the most interesting to read.  You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.  The visible phases of the moon would still have nothing to do with the affect on time however.  \n\nThat was an interesting question, I hope my answer was of some use to you!\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus\n*thanks for correcting me on the orbital change Answer Guy.",6806

Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds.

The stated fact that she is a highly valued employee would suggest that salvaging her is the direction to take, sometimes forgiveness can be applied in the secular world and people who are afforded second chances often go on to become role models. The fact that she has confessed should also be considered in this argument, as this can be deemed as remorse for these actions and remorse is generally an indication that the offence will not be committed again.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power??

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026

My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.  Basically, OW wasn't even in my list of places to consider.  Perhaps some things have changed in the last 15 years or perhaps not, but no new news has prompted me to change my opinion.  I made a point of visiting quite a few universities when I was searching in 1990.  I probably visited OWU, but I don't recall.  It had that much of an impression on me.  In the meantime, Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, Kenyon, Baldwin Wallace, Maimi U, OSU, and some schools in SE Michigan DID make an impression on me and I still wonder if some of them would have been a better choice.  As it was though, I made the decision based on finding a program that was relatively unique and that I found very attractive so that it wasn't the university, but the degree program that won me over.",7102

The kids were tested and came back positive and were taken away. She says that she was told that she was legally responsible for him now. They've been together for approx 10 yrs but are not married. Is this true? I don't believe it is. ; Whether it is true depends on exactly what she was actually told.\nIf she had just posted bail/bond for the guy; then yes, she is legally responsible for him until his court date. That's the same for anyone putting up an appearance bond: you are legally responsible for the person showing up to court.\nIf they told her she could be legally responsible for him cooking in the house; that's a little gray. If she had any prior knowledge at all, she could be held legally responsible for not removing the children from the danger he posed by using the house for a meth lab.\nNow, there is a secondary element at work here. You said they were living together for about ten years. Depending on their conduct, and the laws regarding it in IA, the argument could be made that they actually *are* married, at least by common law; which would open her up to more liability.",7151

Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse.

It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

2,"My husband was told his hep c has gone away, Is that possible? ; This came from our family dr. He was first diagnosed three years ago. ; When people are diagnosed with Hep C, the doctor will order a VIRAL LOAD which reports exactly how much of the virus exists in the body.  A high viral load means that the person has more of the virus in their system.  Conversely, if someone has a low viral load, they have a low amount of the virus in their system...\nI am assuming your husband went through the Intereferon treatments to interefere with the progression of the virus.  If this is the case....\nObviously you know that throughout treatment your husband went in for periodic blood tests.  The doctor was checking his viral load which tells how well the treatment is working.  As long as your husband's viral load was decreasing, it means the treatment was effective.  There becomes a point where the Hep C viral load becomes indetectable.... meaning the viral load is basically 0.  This doesn't mean that it is cured, as your husband will always run the risk of having the virus become active again, but at this point he has no detectable Hep Viral particles in his system.  So for all intents and purposes, he is cured.  At this point he is less contageous than before.  Technically if he has no virus in his system, he cannot pass it along.  \nI hope this informations helps and good luck to you and your husband in the future!!!!  Congrats!",7311

You know, she does all the socially right things (like immediate thank you notes, volunteering to cook on family holidays, sending flowers when people have had a rough week- that type of stuff). But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could.

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Maybe my computer will be so full of virus it won't work any more ha ha. Ifr you see me around smiling you ""NO"" I escaped ha ha.\n\nI know a little boy who just loves those guys who do try to explain the trinity. Ha Ha He says he gets to go home with a pocket full of candy every time they use candy to explain cause the believers in the trinity always give their to him ha ha He said since jesus is God and the three are one they only get one piece and he gets three every time cause he insists the three are3 different.\n\nWow very wise the little boy who says there is no trinity cause he always has plenty of candy and those who do accept the trinity only get to watch his eat it ha ha\n\nNot exactly because that little boy says at times he feels sorry for those trinity believers and does share some of his candy with them. Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

Prolactin production is stimulated by the infant suckling.  \nOxytocin is also a hormone that plays a role in lactation.  Just as prolactin is stimulated by infant suckling, so is oxytocin.

4,"what is DD-RAM? ; answer my question plz... ; I dont know if You mean DVD-RAM\n\nA dvd is a digital video/versatile disk and RAM is Random Access Memory.\nThe DVD-RAM format is based on PD-RW (Phase-Differential) drives, and actually uses a cartridge to hold the media (just like its PD-RW predecessor). Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are).

The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business. Treat your loyal customers well and they will return to you every morning and will start bringing in their friends. Give customers a few low cost freebies and taste tests. They will definitely remember your generosity. \n\nI hope that helps a bit!\n\n~Mark Lim\n\nhttp://www.poisonappleshirts.com",7576

For instance, I am a nurse, and when I go into a patient's room to discuss something with them or give them discharge instructions - I can't even guess how often the stupid cell phone goes off and suddenly it's the most important thing in the world.

1,"Do you know how stones are cut? Also, how did the ancient Egyptians cut the stone and place it in the pyramids ; How did the Ancient Egyptians place the cut stones into the Great Pyramid? I wonder, so please help me answer this question. It is for a research paper, due on Mon. 1/23/06!!!!!!!!! ; the stone may have been cut with a chisel.  the stones may have been placed by workers moving them up ramps and into position.  it is hard to imagine either of these possibilities, but they are the best explanations that i have read.  chiselling such large blocks(i've read as much as 200 tons) and pushing them up a ramp seems unlikely, because even if u had the stones on site(which they probably didn't), building a ramp that could support that much weight, and to that height, would be just as difficult a building the pyramid in the first place.  it's also hard to understand how they had so much time to work on pyramids, when they should have been fishing and farming.  unless you think aliens or magic was involved the best answer is ""with lots of hard work"" and maybe more importantly a long time.",7622
1,"How to solve the Three-Jugs Problem mathematically (Very Complicated!!)? ; Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of water wish to share it evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

9,"what is the difference between peace and war and which one is better? ; so if you're answer is peace is better than war why the people also choose the war and why they broke the peace why they all takecare about the war hate died and all bad thing why they don't wanna to take carre about the gift of the GOD peace live and love ; Unfortunately War is a necessary evil. It sucks, and no one wants to go through it. Well let me re-phrase that, normal people don't want to go through it. But that is why it is at times necessary, not everyone is normal. Occasionally you get a bad guy or group who wants to dominate people by fear and torture. These are not reasonable people, and therefore are not reasoned with by peace or the nicer ways to negotiate, they see peace as a weakness, and try to use it as a way to overcome the peaceful. Anyone who thinks peace is the only way is right (in a perfect world). We don't live in a perfect world so at times war is the only way to get rid of the bad people. Yes war also means death to innocent people and harm and danger to the good forces who fight for the pure cause. Well it is either that or everyone around the world die and suffer under tyrannical groups/rule. The US and Allied military forces understand this concept now more than ever, and they are willing to put their lives on the line to fight for the citizen's of the World freedoms and liberties, which is the desired result of the War on Terror (which does include Iraq, whether anyone wants to admit it, the past regime was a regime which supported and committed terrorist activities on it's own people and the rest of the world).

1,"why is momentum important in physics? ; I personally don't think that momentum is particularly important, but if so, why is it important in physics? ; Momentum is the direct result of the following Newtonian Law of Inertia\nAny object in motion remains in motion and any object at rest remains at rest (unless a net force acts upon the object)\nMomentum (p) is the mass (m) of the object times its velocity (v).\np = mv\n\nForce (F) and Newtons Second Law can be derive from a change in momentum.  That is (t is time)\nF = delta p/delta t \nF = delta (m*v) / dt\nwe usually say m is constant so\nF = m * v/dt\nF =  ma    (a is acceleration or a change in v/time)\n\nNewtons third law is also based on momentum.  ""For every action there is an equal, yet opposite, reaction.""\n\nSo...  When a gun is fired what we see is the bullet propelled forward and the gun (and gun holder) propelled back.  Both received the same Force but because the gun and person holding it are much more massive than the bullet, the bullet will travel much faster. \ne.g F1 is the force on the bullet which is the same as the force on the person F2\nF1 = F2\ndelta p1/dt = delta p2/dt\nm1v1/dt = m2v2/dt\nm1v1 =m2v2\nImagine the bullet is 1 gram and a 180 lbs (~8182 grams) person shot the bullet...

CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc ; Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode.",7790

5,"when was the first time someone used a snowboard and what country or if in usa what state.? ; please answer this correctly it for a school assiment. ; Did you know that the first of the snowboards goes back all the way to 1929? Back then they has skis, but the first person to come up with the idea of a snowboard was a man named M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett. He cut out a plank of plywood and tried to stick his feet to the wood with the help of some clothes and horse reins. It was over 30 years after Burchett that the next step was taken towards the evolution of snowboards. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a chemical gases engineer in Muskegon invented the “The Snurfer”. The name was given by his wife. He came up with the “The Snurfer” in order to entertain his daughter. He made the Snurfer by putting two skis together and putting a rope at the nose so that the rider could hold it and keep it stable. Many of his friends were interested in this Snurfer and that inspired him into licensing his idea to a manufacturer. The Snurfer sold over half a million in 1966 but was only seen as a toy for kids, not something serious enough for adult entertainment. Poppen organized competitions in order to make the Snurfer even more poppular. Jake Burton was really into the Snurfer and participated in the competitions organized by Poppen. Since Burton’s parents wouldn’t buy him a board and let him surf, he amused himself with the Snurfer. He was also very into skiing alongside the Snurfer, but he broke his collarbone in a car accident and couldn’t participate in ski competitions anymore. Meanwhile, a college student, &#92;Dimitrije Milovich started making snowboards in 1969. He came up with the idea after sliding down with a cafeteria plate in College. He started his own company in 1972 with the name “Winterstick”. He got reviewed on Newsweek and Playboy, which increased the popularity of snowboards. Although he left the business in 1980, he is still recognised as one of the most important pioneers in developing snowboards. In 1977, Burton, after graduating from NYU moved to Vermont and started producing new versions of the Snurfer which he still remembered from childhood. He came up with the first binding and he amazed people when he won the Snurfer competition with his very own board with the bindings on it.",7967

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

1,"Explain theory of relativity.? ; please explain it in simplest language.\n\nalso is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nif it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets in it!! ; There are plenty of good websites that answer this question, for any knowledge level. The concept is complex enough that you won’t get a meaningful answer here.\n\nIn horribly oversimplified terms Relativity simply states two things.\n\nOne that there is no universal ‘at rest point’, it all depends on how you choose to define it. You sit in a car doing 100mph and I stand beside the road. Normally we assume that you are in motion and I am at rest. Relativity states that we can just as accurately say that you and the car are at rest and I am moving at 100mph. Alternatively, we normally believe that the Earth orbits the sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Relativity states that it is just as accurate to say that the Earth orbits the moon and the sun orbits the Earth, or we could say that we all orbit some imaginary point in between all three. It is all a matter of choice what we define as being the fixed point.\n\nThe second is that the speed of light is constant regardless of whether you are at rest or moving, and regardless of how fast you move. If you are sitting in a car doing 9/10 of lightspeed and are going past me standing still beside the road and we both look at exactly the same light beam shining down the road we will both see that light beam travelling away from us at exactly the speed of light relative to both of us. You don’t see it slowed down just because you are travelling almost as fast as it is. It will move away form me just as fast as it moves away form you.\n\nThose are the basics, and they aren’t all that hard to understand, even if they don’t seem to make much sense. What Einstein did was sit down and think really hard about the logical consequences of those two points.\n\n\n>>>>>>also is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nYes.\n\n>>>>>if it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets\n>>>> in it!!\n\n\nNo. Just as the Earth doesn't suck the moon in despite having much higher gravity.\n\nThe planets orbitthe Sun. In simple terms that means they are constantly falling around the sun in a ciruclar pattern.\n\nThe best way I have heard this described for the layman  is to imagine yourself throwing a heavy weight like a shotput. You could only throw it a few metres. Now imagine standingon the roof of a house and throwing that same shotput. This time it will go much further before it hits the gorund. Now go to the top of a rally high cliff and throw it. This time the shotput will travel for 20 or 30 metres before it hits the ground.\n\nThe higher you go the further somehting thrown will travel before it hits the ground. And if you go high enough the object will travel right around the world and back to where it starts before it hits the ground. It will continue falling forever. \n\nThe planets are doing exactly that WRT the sun. We are constantly flaling aorund the sun, but we can't be sucked in because we are falling from such a great height.",8070

I have read that it isn't always effective? ..Taking into consideration factors like weight of ammo you can carry, range,recoil,accuracy,and effectiveness against hostiles,vehicles and buildings would you prefer something else? Maybe the 7.62x39 or what about the new 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge? Any news on how this last cartridge is performing in action? Maybe they have finally found the right balance of cartridge size and effectiveness? ; Unhappy.\nHowever there are many different and important factors to keep in mind. The 556 is a small round. Its actually a 22 caliber round.  It is very light weight. Much less then the 7.62x51 (308 winchester). However the 556 is meant to be fired at full auto. The 7.62x51 (by which i will refer to as the 308) is much heavier much more powerful and has too much recoil for full auto. The 308 is still used as a sniper round, even though several others are much better, such as 30-06, or several other (e-mail me and i will tell you why they use the 308) and the 308 is the ammo used for the M240 light machine gun. the 208 is the perfect round for the light machine gun. Say any different and my brother will mix words with you. \nWhatever the government says, the 556 was designed to penetrate soviet body armor. It mushrooms when passing through body armor and actaully has more shock value (due to increased surface area) despite going through the armor. It takes too many hits to take down an opponet and wastes too much ammo. Its really a shame, because there are civial loads of 556 (teachnically 223, because they are on the civilan market) that have much heavier bullets and have far greater stopping power.\n\nthe 6.8 is too dangerous.  Say you are a Marine Force Reacon guy, or Amry Ranger and you are shooting these great 6.8 bullets and killing every enemy. No problem, right? But wait.... You have run out of ammo. you can not resupply from friendly troops, and no one has 6.8 anywhere.

When you check out books, the librarians would ""desensitize"" the books.  When you return the books, they would ""sensitize"" them.  Do these systems use magnetic fields?  The amazing things about them are that they hold their sensitivity for a long time and these tapes can be desnsitize and resensitize as many times as possible. ; yes, they use magnetic fields.  3m appears to not publicize how the technology works (presumably for good reason, if it was well understood then it would be easy to defeat!)\n\nanyway i found a patent for a detection system that has some background that explains how they work.  basically they are a sandwich of 2 kinds of material.  one is a permanently magnetic material, and the other is a permanently-magnetizable material.  the poles of the two materials are oriented in opposite directions.  when you bring the magnetizable material near a strong magnet, it is magnetized, and the magnetic fields cancel out.\nthis allows them to pass through a detector without setting it off.  then when they are returned, they are exposed to a field that orients the magnetizable material the other way, which makes the fields add up into a strong magnetic field. this makes them set off the detector when you walk through it.\n\nmore info at the link below, which is not a patent for tattle-tape, but a patent for some kind of sensitizing/desensitizing system for tattle-tape:\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1='tattle+tape'&OS=%22tattle+tape%22&RS=%22tattle+tape%22",8308

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393

1,"Importance of limiting reagents? ; Why is it important to have a limiting reagent when performing a lab experiment? and why is it not simpler to make both reactions go to completion? ; In some cases, when the reaction rate is fast, and the reaction goes all the way to completion, one uses the stoichiometric amounts necessary to convert all of reactants.  But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.  So, you use a large excess of one of the reactants, which causes all, or almost all, of the other reactant to be converted.",8475
1,"How can I design a BKU chiller heat exchanger? ; Any sample calculations would be useful to calculate the LMTD and heat transferred ; When you say you want to design a chiller, I assume you mean the process design not the mechanical design. \n\nThe amount of heat being transferred is a given based on the process requirements. \n\nSince this is a BKU the shell side temperature both in and out will be the temperature of the refrigerant ""bath"" therefore the LMTD calculation is pretty straight forward.\n\nThe inlet and outlet temperatures on the tube side are also process design requirement and fixed by the process. \n\nThe actual materials of construction have very little to do with the actual sizing of the exchanger. Knowing the overall heat transfer coefficient is more a factor of the boiling liquid on the shell side and any condensing on the tube side. Velocity through the tubes is also a main factor.\n\nThe actual calculations are a trial and error method, because of this there are many computer programs to do the calculation for you. To attempt to provide a set of useful sample calculations on this site is not possible. You have to assume a tube size, number of tubes, tube length, tube arrangement, tube spacing and an acceptable pressure on the tube side.",8476

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602

2,"Why do I yawn all the time, I am not even tired? ; I mean I yawn all freaking day! I cant stand it! ; THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, and the one that is taught in medical school, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. \n\nStudies have shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung capacity; for the most part, we just use the air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sacs, called alveoli, don’t get fresh air, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or take a yawn to get more air into the lungs.\n\nBut certain aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning in the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t take oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reasons unclear.\n\nAnother puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn in association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).",8680

1,"Why does vitamin d cause thirst? ; For instance, drinking milk or anything else fortified with vitamin d will only make me more thirsty after 5 or 10 minutes. ; Your experience is interesting!  My first thought is as follows:  Vitamin D inhibits the renin-angiotensin system which plays a role in fluid balance (and therefore blood pressure) in the body.  You may have a genetic polymorphism (variation) creating a 'hypersensitivity' to vitamin D in this system.  However, if Vitamin D is really the cause of your thirst response, does exposure to sunlight also produce this effect in 5 or 10 minutes?  Lastly, I would expect it to take longer than 5 or 10 minutes for any vitamin D consumed to actually get into your blood stream.\n\nSo....if I haven't confused you by now, I guess the best answer I can offer is.... ""that's a good question!""\n\nBest wishes and good luck!",8721

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788

9,"Dose every child has a right to a meaningful life? ; First of all, what are the criteria for a meaningful life, and who decides whether or not a life is meaningful? This kind of reasoning has already gone so far that some courts have convicted parents for giving birth to children that they knew ahead of time, from prenatal tests, would be deformed!\n\nIt should be kept in mind that this same logic leads to the murdering of larger deformed human beings who live elsewhere (that is, outside the womb.) The logic of abortionists leads inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia. Even some pro-abortionists (Joseph Felcher, for example) admit that the two issues are logically tied together. In fact, there would be greater logical justification for taking the life of someone already known to be deformed than one which prenatal tests have simply indicated might be. ; Oh, please state your source. I'd love to hear the details of a case where parents were convicted (of what, you don't say) for having a deformed baby.\n\nNo one has a right to a ""meaningful life."" Life is what you make it.

You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

I tell her all the time she looks fine, but she just argues with me. ; The general formula for a female is 100lbs + 5lbs for each inch over 5ft tall.  So for you sister her ""ideal"" weight would be 140lbs.  Keep in mind that this is just a guideline.  Other factors which will affect this are genetics, bone structure and muscle mass.  Small bone structure will obviously weight less.  And since muscle weighs more than fat, a more muscular person will weigh more than the same physical size person with a higher % bodyfat.  My guess is your sister sounds like she is pretty thin, with a small bone structure and not much muscle mass.  And I would think she would benefit from starting a full body resistance exercise routine to add a little more healthy muscle mass and probably improve your body shape as well (muscle gives shape to the body).",9126

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146

However, i was a shy boy (though still is) and the fact is that she had boyfriends one after another THROGHT OUT the teen years. and God know how many times i felt sour and my heart sank whenever i saw her with her guy(s).\n\nDuring the poly years, i had a girlfriend and she was having a relatively more committed relationship. so my heart was with my girl at the time and hence u can only say that i have been a secret admirer ""on-and-off"" for 10 years.\n\nOFF, is when i have a gf, my heart have no one else. and even when i'm single, i won't fall for a girl who is attached.\n\nON, is for the times when we were both unattached. it kind of give me hope bcoz she is available. For the past 10 years, i never take any action for these ""on"" periods. \n\nFor the past 2 months, we kind of reconnect our communication. Bcoz i'm studying in uni now and she is working, we have chance to chat for few hours daily on MSN. (mon-fri working hours only though, coz she don't usually use msn at home)\n\nFrom recent chats, \nshe told me that she is now single, and she mentioned that she is not a late-queen for dates nowadays. \nAnd after she know that i used to have one painful and hurtful relationship, she said that ppl have to move on and ""if there's a good girl whom u like then give it a try"" \nShe also claims that she only regard herself who had only 2 relationships coz sec sch histores are just childish ones.\n\nWe talked a lot rubbish, shared a lot of views, joked a lot and ""suan"" each other a lot and i feel (or maybe only i feel)that we start to have some connection.\n\nSo, last week, i managed to find some courage a said.. \n\n""you wrote on my sec sch autograph book that i can call u anytime, so.. can i call u tonight??"" \n\nbut she replied ""lol.. i have a dinner appointment tonight."" \n\nI was rather disappointed. I thought, if she doesn't mind me calling she would have state a time or sth. \n\nBut soon after, she said ""next time we catch up with a movie, after your exam?"", ""when your exam finish?"", ""talk is cheap, fix a date now""....\n\nso, our tentative date (or sec sch class monitor-monitress re-union if putting it mildly) is 3 dec!! just 2 days aft my exam. But the point is that we only chat on MSN and have not advanced into phone-talk and constant sms-es.\n\nI keep thinking of her recently. and thinking..\nShd i postpone it? coz i just had a bad haircut.\nwhat shd i say? how shd i behave? will i just blush and panic? is that anything in my walldrode that can match her smile and style? shd i pay for everything? where shd we eat?? It's not like i don't have experience.\nAlthough i had gf before. But this time is different. She is a special person to me.

The romantic female side of me thinks it has great potential to be a wonderful love story.  That's the problem.  Love stories are just that..stories.  In reality you sound like a stalker.  It is just not that serious for this girl.  She probably sees you as an old school chum she would not mind spending an evening with sometime.  \n\nIt seems to me that you need to move on with your life and get out more.  Consider it just a date.  I thought only women thought things through this deeply when it came to relationships.  Hearing a man confess to such flights of whimsy (the gift, the love note confession, et' all) is a little creepy to be honest.  Sensitive is nice, obsessive is just creepy.  You sound obsessive, or at least quite immature and inexperienced.  Almost a stereotype of, well, an engineering student.  \n\nDon't confess undying love.  Don't buy a gift.  Don't write the love note.  Don't sweat the haircut.  Just pick her up.  Take her to dinner, enjoy the moment, escort her home and tell her you'd like to see her again.  \n\nYou've waited 10 years, so you have time.  Get to know her.

However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

Personally, I think burning a flag is disgusting...however, I respect your right to express your views despite the fact that I may find them highly disagreeable.\n\nP.S. This will help you with your paper: http://www.vote-smart.org/  Check out that website.  You can find the names of the members of Congress from your state, see how they voted on the recent proposal to ban flag burning, and even read a copy of the proposal.  It also gives you the e-mail addresses of your representatives so you can write them and ask them more about it, why they voted the way they did, etc.  Good luck.",9486

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.  This requires crunches but sit ups will work if you don't have access to a machine.\n\nYou could try taking creatine ester.  It causes your existing muscles to swell a little bit.  It might make you look a little better in the two weeks.  You get it at the health food store.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to tone and increase your build, you need to join a gym because its really difficult to do it without machines.  Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

By this, I don't mean that I'm arrogant. I don't go around bragging about my ability, I don't go looking for fights, and I can't catch bullets with my teeth. What I mean is that if a situation does arise, I KNOW I can handle it. \n   You take on a different viewpoint when you know that you can really hurt someone...when you know that you could break bones, cripple or kill someone if you really had to. The question becomes ""Was what this guy did REALLY worth hurting him that badly? Does he REALLY deserve that?""\n   So, when some loudmouth ticks you off and insults you or your siginficant other, you have the self confidence to walk away. You know you could go hand him his butt on a silver platter, but you don't HAVE to just to prove a point to yourself. When some immature clown says, ""Hey, you take Karate...show me something!"" you know you don't have to get into a sparring match just to prove to them that you are good. \nYou get to that point when you don't feel you have anything else to prove to yourself, and you certainly don't have to prove anything to anyone else. A sort of serenity sets in when you realize that life is not a competition where you win when you are the absolute best and everyone knows it. You're good.....you're good enough that you can deal with something BAD if it should happen. That's all that matters.",9727

Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came to Earth in an attempt catch Zeus with the nymphs.\n\nEcho wanted to save her nymph friends, so she talked to Hera incessantly in order to distract her and allow time for Zeus and the nymphs to leave. However, Hera eventually interrupted Echo and went into the field where Zeus and the nymphs had been. When she saw the field was empty, Hera realized what Echo had done and punished her.\n\nOvid's version of events states that Zeus employed Echo to occupy Hera whilst he continued with his adulteries. Hera soon saw through this ruse and punished her so that she could say only the last words of other people's sentences (echolalia). She could not speak of her own accord and so was deprived of the thing she loved the most.\n\nIn the time of Echo's suffering, there was a human named Narcissus. He was so handsome that every girl or boy that saw him immediately fell in love with him. But Narcissus had no heart, and loved no one.\n\nOne day, Echo met Narcissus and, like every other girl and boy, fell in love with him. Echo could not speak to him, but she had felt she needed to see him. So Echo followed him, just enough to see him, but not enough to be seen.\n\nNarcissus became lost and called out, ""Is anyone here?""\n\nEcho said, ""Here, here, here.""\n\nNarcissus told whoever was there to come out. Echo came out and, because she couldn't talk, used her hands to show Narcissus how much she loved him. Narcissus, annoyed that so many people liked him, rejected her love. Echo, heart-broken, prayed to Aphrodite for death. Her prayer was answered, but Aphrodite loved her voice, so she let her voice live on.",9804
0,"For those who believe in Jesus Christ.? ; If Jesus died for ALL your sins why do you still have to go to confession. ; Good question. \nLet me see if I can explain.\n\nOkay sin is all sin, but there are 2 ""kinds"" of sin. There is sin and then there are sins (plural).\n\nAll sin seperates us from God becasue God is perfect and he can't be with sin. So sin always blocks us from him.\n\nWhen we are born, we are born in sin, therefore sin is in our hearts. (To put it another way, we have a root of sin in us) That is why we need to be saved. When we accept Christ, he forgives us and that root (sin) is gone. We are completely forgiven, and we recieve access to God. That is what salvation is.\n\nHowever, even though we are forgiven and saved, we still mess up sometimes because we are human and we're not perfect. In other words, we commit sins. The sins we commit will not keep us out of heaven (becasue we have been saved)but they will keep us from God (because all sin does that). They get in the way of our faith and hinder our prayers. (For example have you ever messed up and felt guilty, then you were hesitant to pray because of the guilt?) Those sins will always get in our way, but as soon as we confess them to God, he forgives them and takes them away. Then the block is gone and he is free to continue moving in our lives. \n\nSo think of it this way, we are saved when we accept Christ, so we no longer have to worry about going to hell. But confession helps us to maintain a good relationship with our father.\n\nLook at it this way. If you have a child, you will love your child no matter what. Hopefully you would discipline your child, but you would never seriously harm them, and you would always protect them to the best of your ability. But if the child decided to rebel, run away from home, and ""live a life of sin,"" it would be harder for you to protect the child, and the child would get hurt along the way. On the other hand, if the child was obediant and respectful to you, it would be easier and the child would be better off (safer, better taken care of becuase you would have the ability to provide better in that case). But you would still love the child either way right. In the same way, God loves us no matter what we do, but as we confess our sins and obey him, we give him more ability to care for us better. If we run away and rebel, he still loves us, but we are on our own to sufer the consequenses that go with the sin we commit. So obviously the best thing for us is to confess and stay close to our father, so that we may recieve the full protection and benefits. (Plus from the parent perspective that's what He wants us to do becasue he wants to care for us closely.)\n\nOf course how you confess is between you and God. Ultimately God is the only one you have to answer to. However confessing to others (whom you trust) often does help becasue it helps us to ""walk in the light"" and avoid sin. I personally have never been to a formal confession, but I have benefited alot from accountibility partners and groups. In other words I have turned to trusted friends and confessed to them when I needed to. They in turn prayed for me and encouraged me, helping me get through things I needed to get through in life. I would definately suggest hooking up with a person or small group where you can do this.",9812

1,"RH-NEG blood types? ; I'm curious to know if anyone has info about research being done on the origins of this type of blood factor. Some argue that it's a mutation, but if that's so then why is o-neg the universal blood. Others say it was the original blood factor, but why then is there no rheses strain in it? Any idea's or info? ; Rh Blood Types\n\n\nRh click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced blood types were discovered in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener.  This was 40 years after Landsteiner had discovered the ABO blood groups.  Over the last half century, we have learned far more about the processes responsible for Rh types.  This blood group may be the most complex genetically of all blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cells that are controlled by 2 closely linked genes on chromosome 1.\n\nThe Rh system was named after rhesus click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced  monkeys, since they were initially used in the research to make the antiserum for typing blood samples.  If the antiserum agglutinates your red cells, you are Rh+ click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  If it doesn't, you are Rh- click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  Despite its actual genetic complexity, the inheritance of this trait usually can be predicted by a simple conceptual model in which there are two alleles, D and d.  Individuals who are homozygous dominant (DD) or heterozygous (Dd) are Rh+.  Those who are homozygous recessive (dd) are Rh- (i.e., they do not have the key Rh antigens).\n\nClinically, the Rh factor, like ABO factors, can lead to serious medical complications. The greatest problem with the Rh group is not so much incompatibilities following transfusions (though they can occur) as those between a mother and her developing fetus.  Mother-fetus incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh- (dd) and the father is Rh+ (DD or Dd).  Maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells.  The risk increases with each pregnancy.  Europeans are the most likely to have this problem--13% of their newborn babies are at risk.  Actually only about ½ of these babies (6% of all European births have complications.  With preventive treatment, this number can be cut down even further.  Less than 1% of those treated have trouble.  However, Rh blood type incompatibility is still the leading cause of potentially fatal blood related problems of the newborn.  In the United States, 1 out of 1000 babies are born with this condition.\n\nRh type mother-fetus incompatibility occurs only when an Rh+ man fathers a child with an Rh- mother.  Since an Rh+ father can have either a DD or Dd genotype, there are 2 mating combinations possible:\n\ndrawings of two Punnett squares showing the possible Rh positive mates of an Rh negative woman and the probability of their children being Rh positive--100% if the father is homozygous dominant and 50% if he is heterozygous for this trait\n\nOnly the Rh+ children (Dd) are likely to have medical complications.  When both the mother and her fetus are Rh- (dd), the birth will be normal.\n  \n\ndrawing of a fetus in its mother's uterus; the placenta and the umbilical cord are highlighted\n\nHuman fetus in a mother's uterus\n(the umbilical cord and placenta\nconnect the fetus to its mother)\n \n\nThe first time an Rh- woman becomes pregnant, there usually are not incompatibility difficulties for her Rh+ fetus.  However, the second and subsequent births are likely to have life-threatening problems.  The risk increases with each birth.  In order to understand why first born are normally safe and later children are not, it is necessary to understand some of the placenta's functions.  Nutrients and the mother's antibodies regularly transfer across the placental boundary into the fetus, but her red blood cells usually do not (except in the case of an accidental rupture).  Normally, anti-Rh+ antibodies do not exist in the first-time mother unless she has previously come in contact with Rh+ blood.  Therefore, her antibodies are not likely to agglutinate the red blood cells of her Rh+ fetus.  \n\nPlacental ruptures do occur normally at birth so that some fetal blood gets into the mother's system, stimulatin",9822

You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.  I get the two confused all the time but hyperthyroidism means your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone and hypothyroid means it makes not enough.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, a young thin person can have hypothyroidism.  I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850
1,"Is there dwarfism in turtles? ; Okay here's why I asked this: I've been enjoying catching and releasing turtles since I was a little girl.

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

Give it all, and always be there when she needs you. May be you can give yourself as a present? Don't be afraid , because you love her.",9882

3,"Is it correct to say, ""I don't hardly...""? ; I'm trying to solve a petty dispute about double negatives. My friend always uses this sentence structure. He says something like, ""I don't hardly sleep."" I say this is incorrect because I was taught that even though the word 'hardly' isn't like any other negative, it is still a negative nonetheless. In saying the quote above wouldn't he be saying the exact opposite than he means, which is something like ""I sleep a lot."" He means to say, ""I hardly ever sleep,"" or ""I don't sleep very much."" I'm just a little confused. I need someone who knows their grammar. ; It's better to say ""I hardly"" or ""I rarely."" ""Don't Hardly"" is a double-negative.",9951
4,"Ebay are a joke? Ebays Reply!? ; I have reported one of their precious ""power sellers"" not only for misleading advertising on their auction but a method of auction posting that is actually doing Ebay out of money and is forbidden according to their selling rules. The seller advertises goods for 49p and displays £1.49 in the postage section at the top section of the advert when people buy and pay they are then sent an email asking for a postage and packing fee! Apparently the £1.49 was for collection! I reported this on Friday. It's now the following Wednesday and all EBAY are doing is faffing about send me emails to ""validate my email stream""! They are a disgrace and they are just fobbing me off. It seems Power sellers can get away with it? See what you think?\nhttp://cgi.ebay.co.uk/usb-dongle-charger \nAnyone that thinks I should read the small print should also read ebays sellers rule about low buy prices and extortionate postage prices\nEbays Reply ...\n\nHello,\n\nThank you for your reply regarding your transaction with \n""21st-century-gadgets"" for the mobile phone case, item number \n28004xxxxxebay. I'm sorry that this matter hasn't yet been resolved. I \nunderstand you feel that the seller is charging too much for postage of \nthe item.\n\nThe seller is responsible for determining the shipping and handling \ncharges on their listings, and eBay encourages sellers to clearly \ndescribe the item and terms of shipping / delivery in their listings to \navoid possible confusion. Before bidding on a listing, bidders should \ncontact the seller about any questions they might still have that are \nnot directly answered in the listing's description. \n\nWhen a bid is placed, the bidder is entering into an agreement with the \nseller to purchase the item, which most often means incurring shipping \ncharges that may also include handling fees.\n\nI would encourage you to try and work this out with the seller. Usually \nthese situations can be amicably resolved. However, refusing to purchase\nan item may result in negative feedback, as well as an Unpaid Item \nstrike against your account. For more information on our unpaid item \nprocess, please see the following eBay page:\n\nhttp://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/tp/unpaid-item-process.html\n\nWe also urge you to leave appropriate feedback for this user via our \nFeedback Forum:\n\nhttp://pages.ebay.co.uk/services/forum/feedback.html\n\nYou can reach the Feedback Forum by clicking ""Services"" and then \n""Feedback Forum"" in the Navigation Bar.\n\nI hope that this information is useful.

6,"Looking for software:Run under Windows,Outlook Express-like which archives my incoming and outgoing mail.? ; Help me add columns to create my own database.\nHelp me add transactions to it like abstracts of my normal mail and faxes.Archive those stuff. ; First and Foremost - have you looked at Yahoo's email?  It's very good - and sound like it will do what you want.  Plus, the Beta (not yet fully released - but soon - I HOPE!) is looking like it will blow all other web based emails (Hotmail, Gmail) out of the water!!!  I can't wait!  :)\n\nSecond - try Thunderbird.  (http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird)\n\nIt's supposed to be an excellent email program - and offers a TON of add-ons that will help you make it even more powerful.  Just know that it is a program in flux.  It's what is called ""Open-Source"" meaning the code for it is open, and everyone helps build it and work with it.  This is a good thing, but also means a program like that will operate like a beta program at times because it needs to be ""tweaked"" yet.\n\nI also have a friend who likes ""The Bat.""  I know nothing about it - other than he LOVES it and swears by it.  Do a Yahoo search on ""The Bat Email"" and you'll find it.  :)\n\nI hope this helps!",9954
