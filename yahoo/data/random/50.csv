1,"Marble Rollocoster? ; I am learning about Nutin's law an object going in a straight line will remain to until it is acted on. I am doing an obsticle corse for it in school, so does anyone know anything that will slow a marble down? ; A marble is a rolling mass.  The theory is that the marble rolls along and the area of the marble in contact with the surface it is rolling on is not slipping.\n\nAs the marble rolls along, the forces that act on it are \n\n1.  Gravity\n\n2.  Air resistance\n\nI recommend that you focus on gravity to create forces of predictable magnitude and direction.  You can use ramps and then apply Newton's laws and a little trig to calculate the force magnitudes and predict the motion of the marble. As long as you have a decent velocity without being too fast, air resistance will be negligible.\n\nI designed a simple track for you that you could make out of light plywood and some glue.\n\nThe track I propose will be a valley that is 2 meters long (a little over 6 feet) and 1/2 meter wide( 20 inches wide will give you some margin).  The valley sides are set at an angle of 30 degrees.  At one end of the valley at the top of the valley side set up a ramp that will inject a marble such that the direction of the velocity of the marble is straight with respect to the edge of the valley.  The height of the ramp will control the velocity of the.\n\nNow, consider a coordinate system that has x starting from the same end as the ramp and running parallel to the sides of the valley.  y is perpindicular to the sides of the valley.\n\nI created a variable, h, that is the vertical height of the starting end of the ramp with respect to the entry point of the marble.\nUsing conservation of energy, the velocity of the marble will be related through the equation:\n1/2*m*v^2=m*g*h\nv=sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nThe time it will take the marble to roll the length of the valley I set as t\nlength of the valley is 2m\nso 2m=v*t\nt=2/sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nWhen the marble enters the top edge of the valley it will have a velocity in the x direction of v as derived above.  This is your constant velocity since the only forces that will act on the marble in the x direction is air resistance, which we will assume to be negligible.\nSince the marble enters the valley near the top edge, it will be acted on by gravity to pull it down the edge.  If you have the marble enter the ramp at exactly .25m from the center, it reach the center of the ramp in time t'\nwhere \n.25=1/2*g*cos(30)*t'^2\nor t'=sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\n\nI thought it would be fun to consider an experiment where you control how many times the marble rolls across the center of the valley before exiting at the other end.\nThis I set as N\nNote that t/t'=N\nN=(2/sqrt(2*g*h))/sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\nN=2*sqrt(g*cos(30))/sqrt(2*g*h*.5)\nN=2*sqrt(cos(30)/h)\n\nThen I thought that it would be fun to set up an equation where we decide how many Ns we want according to how high we set the end of the ramp.  Sound like fun?\n\nN^2=4*cos(30)/h\nh=4*cos(30)/N^2\n(h is in units of meters)\nN   h(m)   h(inches)\n3    .385    15.15\n4    .0771   3.04\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nj",9

5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13
9,"Did you really get a tax cut under Bu$h? ; Some do not understand even simple math. I pay $2200 per year in School taxes on my property, in simple math is this a Tax cut? It increased 5 times in 4 years under Bu$h.\n\nWASHINGTON - If it seems like your taxes have been going up, they probably have — at least at the state level. State taxpayer burdens increased by an average of 41 percent from 1994 to 2004, according to newly released data from the census bureau. Only one state, Alaska, saw the amount it collects per person decline. Even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation, the individual tax burdens increase in 43 states.\nHawaiians last year paid the most to state government — $3,050 per person on average. Texans paid the least — an average of $1,368.\nRising education and Medicaid costs have fueled spending growth, which has led to higher taxes, analysts said.\n""Medicaid has been the fastest growing program in state budgets going back to 2000,"" said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst at the National Council of State Legislatures.\nMedicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. In an effort to stem rising costs, Congress passed legislation last week allowing states to charge about 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries new or increased co-payments and premiums. ; Only if you are a major corporation and/or a really rich person that does not need a tax cut.

0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

9,"Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? ; Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? \n\n\nBy Derek Shaw \nThe Daily Trojan\nOctober 4, 2002 \nGeorge Orwell's ""1984"" depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. The threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the ""Party,"" the single political power in the totalitarian state of Oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people.\n\nSound somewhat familiar? Well it should ...\n\nAs the likelihood of war in the Middle East continues to escalate, American citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing Americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. \n\nWithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in ""1984"" to the affairs of today.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nIn ""1984,"" the bold slogan of the Party is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" This set of socio-political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. The assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption.\n\nThe state of Oceania in ""1984"" is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever-shifting enemy. The government leads the public to \n\nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact \n\nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. One day the enemy is Eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is Eastasia and has always been Eastasia. The people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. The real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred.\n\nToday we are facing imminent war with Iraq. A year ago our target was al-Qaida and bin Laden. Then it became a battle within Afghanistan. And just to be sure, President George W. Bush openly labeled Iran, North Korea and Iraq as the ""axis of evil."" In a later speech, he added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIndeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. On Aug. 22, 2002, Bush called Saddam Hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. Granted, Hussein is not the first person on most of our Christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? Surely it is a mere coincidence that Bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting Iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world.\n\nIn many ways, Bush has become the physical manifestation of Big Brother, the omnipotent, all-knowing symbol of leadership in Oceania. In ""1984,"" Big Brother is both feared and loved by the people. His power goes untested. Similarly, the Bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the American people have responded with a show of faith and support. In fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show American pride with stickers, T-shirts and flags. A frenzy of nationalism has infected our country; and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the United States.\n\nAs a result, American freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. In ""1984,"" signs re ; With massive data bases of information piling up in government and corporate computers as well as security cameras around every corner and on every cell phone, I often get the feeling Big Brother is watching.  However, I feel Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is better example of the direction we have been moving as a society.  Everywhere people are seeking their own ""Soma"" to cover up our social flaws.  We are also pushing closer and closer to his predictions of class and family structures .",40

1,"when zinc rod is immeersed in blue colour copper sulphate. blue colour fades away. give reasons.? ; chemistry ; all the information you need is in the handy periodic table.   First, think about the charges of the molecules....\n\n In the molecule CuSO4, copper has two electrons to give.  The SO4 molecule wants TWO more electrons to acheive noble gas configuration (a stable electron state).   This appears to be a match in heaven.  \n\nWell all is fine until Zinc comes along.  If you look at the periodic table, Zinc is just to the right of copper.  It too has 2 electrons to donate......but, it is more electronegative than copper. (remember, electronegativity  is the lowest in the bottom left corner of the table(Fr) and increases on  a diagonal path  with F being the most electronegarive.)  \n\nSince Zinc is more reactive than Copper,  a replacement reaction occurs.  Zinc bumps Copper off of the SO4 molucule.  Zinc can be whitiish to yellowish in solution.  As all the Zinc is coming off the rod, it bumps the copper off the SO4 and also disperses the colour of the copper.  If you had one drop of blue dye (the copper), but added a cup of milk. ( the Zinc)...... you would barely see the blue color.",43
9,"Can John Kerry keep his freaking mouth shut, a week before the election? ; I don't think his remark will hurt the democrats in the election, most people already have their minds made up.

I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.  Give it a couple of days, and it'll get warmer.\n\nQuite frankly, though, I prefer weather in the 60s and 70s.  It's just about perfect.",78

It was a strange non-denomiational church that had some really odd beliefs.  I used to smoke back in those days and the pastor was telling his congregation that people should not be afraid to do what they want.  If you feel like jumping up and dancing in church then do it.  Church should be about freedom.  \n\nSo I lit a cigarette and started smoking.  He stopped and told me that there was no smoking in church.  I told him I was just following his lead.  He said that was no what he meant.  I apologized for interrupting his freedom speech and left.  \n\nIt was embarrassing to me now but it was funny then.,83

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

What do I need to know. ; Don't decide you want to become Wicca until you know something about it - that is what you need to know - Wicca is a very specific 'branch' of Paganism, it is a priesthood within it's own rights, as well as a lot of study it can be difficult to find a coven in order to become Wicca.\n\nGeneral tips would fall into – study study study – with a lot of misinformation about Wicca it is easy for people to fall into thinking they are Wicca when in fact they are not, I have honestly met people who have called themselves Wicca for 10 years without actually realising they are not Wicca as until that point they had been unable or unwilling to step out of their comfort zone to study further into Wicca past their bad sources they had been used to for so long. Don't fall into that trap, Wicca is a constant learning path and it is no good closing yourself off to new information that challenges your current ideas on what Wicca is – although misinformation is hardly a positive there is at least one thing to be said of misinformation about Wicca, it helps determine those serious about becoming Wicca from those unwilling.\n\nWith that said there are things to avoid – Wicca is an initiate-only oath-bound priesthood working within a pagan mystery tradition, generally if a book or web site says otherwise they are not a reliable source, there are other signs to avoid such as people who use the spelling 'magick' are often uneducated themselves, people who use mechanical magic (i.e. copying spells from books or each other) – that is not to say these sources cannot teach you something. You will find most people will pooh-pooh people such as Horne, Ravenwolf, Buckland, etc. however valid their complaints are there are often some parts of their writing that are valid, and if nothing else you can use these as a test to your own knowledge as the more you study the more you can tell the reliable information from the nonsense.\n\nGet yourself into a good forum, you will find many forums are filled with people who look to Wicca as an escape from Christianity or as a fashionable title, however there are some groups around that do have Wicca that have a strong community that can help you study and guide you in the right direction – Amber & Jet being a prime example of this. Another idea would be to find yourself local Pagan contacts or go along to local pagan meetings to form study groups, find a coven, find a teacher, or simply have a community to support you or just chit-chat with (a note here, study should come before training, or else you won't know who is really knowledgeable on the subject and who is not when it comes to finding a teacher or coven).\n\nWith that I suppose all I can do is give you some reliable links and books to look through – with books if you cannot afford them try swapping with others online or in your area, and remember you don't have to just stick to books on Wicca but can also get books on related subjects such as paganism, herb lore, mythology, divination, etc.\n\nIf you do want to become Wcica in the end if you cannot find a coven locally you will have to find one, many Seekers will actually move locations to find a coven to join so to become Wicca, others simply convert to Neo-wicca if they cannot find a coven.\n\nGood luck :o)\n\n\nSome links to help you learn a little more about Wicca;\n\nhttp://amberandjet.spiralpaths.org - Amber & Jet\nhttp://www.cyprian.org/Articles/gardchron.htm - Gardnerian Chronology and Bibliography\nhttp://www.wargoddess.net/index.php - Enyo`s Workshop\nhttp://wicca.timerift.net/ - Wicca: For the Rest of Us\nhttp://www.homecircle.info - Homecircle\nhttp://www.starkindler.org/ - StarFire Rising\nhttp://www.asiya.org/ - Asiya`s Shadows\nhttp://www.whywiccanssuck.com - Why Wiccans Suck\nhttp://www.newwiccanchurch.net - New Wiccan Church International\nhttp://members.tripod.com/~Moonpfyr/gardnerian.html - Gardnerian Tradition\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Athen",150

9,"If You Were A Supreme Court Justice...? ; I think that a lot of our justices today base their decisions on the wrong criterias...\n\nSo...If you were a Supreme Court Justice, what beliefs and principles would you hold to guide you in making decisions? ; Entirely on the Constitution, but with the following in mind:\n\n(1) Most judges today ignore the 9th and 10th amendment. The powers not EXPLICITLY granted the federal goernment are reserved for the states and the people respectively. So, for example, since abortion or what are oddly called ""reproductive rights"" are not mentioned in the US Constitution (and mentioning the 14th amendment when ruling on Roe v.Wade was a stretch), I would say that the state has the right to make laws forbidding or allowing abortion. The federal government simply has no role, just like they do not have a role in states passing laws about the death penalty.\n(2) I would reject the ""living constitution"" bs many judges talk about. The living constitution theory of jurisprudence says it makes the constitution ""flexible"", in reality, it makes it very rigid by allowing judges to nullify the other two branches of the government. The constitution was designed to make the legislative branch, the one ""closest to the people"" the one which makes the laws. Then comes the president who ENFORCES those laws, and then comes the judiciary whose job is to INTREPRET those laws and to intrepret whether they are being enforced correctly. The judiciary isn't there to make new laws by simply talking about ""living constitution"" thwarting the will of the people.",201

Click then on the ""Wallpaper"" link next to ""Show:"" to show only the large images, since you just want a section of the image and for that, the larger the image, the better. Select an image that has the type of scale you are looking for, go to its original web page, and download it. Then with an image editor cut a section of the image with just scales and use that image for your background.\nThis may or may not work for your purposes, but it's an idea.\nAnother option is to go to a pet store or a zoo with a good digital camera and take a close up picture of an iguana, lizzard, or whatever works, a crocodile would probably be perfect :)",289

9,"Wat is the protectionist policy followed by US and other developed countries part of WTO? ; and why isnt free trade good for everyone? ; I am assuming you are referring to trade policy.  Protectionist policies are those that advantage domestic goods over foreign goods (exports v imports) through either tarriffs (surcharges added to the price of a good being imported) or through subsidies (price supports or distributive policies within a country) to grow or make some item.\nObviously, similiar to the micro level of a larger grocery store being able to get better prices when negotiating with its suppliers compared to a smaller chain or a 'mom & pop' type store, larger countries (typically first world) are better positioned to DICTATE supply agreements (not much can be done about demand---other than to decrease it through tarriffs (VAT) which would be passed on to the consumer).  \nThird and second world countries are often in a very tenuous position:  their government wants to expand their economy through increasing exports, however, often this is done through either internally, creating subsidies (which many cannot afford to do) or agreeing to 'lopsided' trade agreements, which wind up exploiting or at a minimum, disadvantaging their citizens and other workers in their respective countries or nations.  Additionally, there are contravening issues like human rights and environmental standards which may also be of concern.\nI hope this helps, but here are some articles for you to read and consider; as well as the WTO link",341

Many thanks!! ; Sounds liek your doctor is a quack. A relaxation CD? Well TMD is a complex disease that people don't really understand all that well but there are steps to treatment. First step is that if you grind or clench at night or in the daytime is to correct that problem. Stressing a bad joint is only going to make the problem worse. So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain. Stop ibuprofen though if it tears up your stomach. There are treatments .... and there are steps.  This guy giving you a CD and charging you money for that crap is not medicine",364

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

And is it true, Incorporating in Nevada the easiest. ; The cheapest way to incorporate is to do it yourself. You can get all the forms you need from your state ""Department of Corporations"" Go to your state and put in a request to reserve a name, that normally cost about $10.00-$15.00. They will normally require at least 2-4 names so if the main one is used they have a couple of more to research.\n\nThere are a few sites that will incorporate you for less than $300.00, but you would need a Corporate Seal that you can pick up at staples. Some of the sites sell them for as low as $45.00\nYou will have to check out the add ons that you would want them to do in the forming of your corporation.\n \nIf you do not live in Nevada and you incorporate in Nevada, you may do business in Nevada. If you don't live in Nevada and you decide to do business in the state in which you live your Nevada corporation would be considered an alien Corporation in your state. You would have to pay an additional fee for your state to allow your alien Corporation to do business in your state. This fee is any where from $200.00-$600.00.\n\nThe reason people set up a corporation in Nevada is because Nevada does not give out information about the corporation officers, money earned and stuff to the IRS. If you set up business in your state with your Nevada corporation I think you lose that shield in the other state, because the corporate with the IRS.  \n\nTry this link and see if they can offer you a good deal on doing your corporation.\n\nhttp://www.clickandinc.com\n\nI hope this has been of some use to you, good luck. \n\n""FIGHT ON""",525
3,"What is the quickest way to get a degree in Nursing? ; I am interested in becoming an R.N. and I have heard it is possible to do in as little as 2 years. I would be starting from scratch (just high school diploma) Is 2 years possible? ; There are 3 ways in becoming a nurse (RN).  Diploma program, associate's degree, and bachelor's degree.  You can also become an LPN.  The diploma program and associate degree program take 2 years to complete.  However, most AD (associate's degree) programs require sciences to be completed or will put you on a wait list.  The AD program is usually offered by a community college or local college.  The diploma program is easier to get into (no wait list, no sciences prior to admission) and is offered by a hospital or adult community classes.  The LPN is usually offered through adult classes and will only take 1 year.  The advantage of becoming an LPN is that you will become a nurse in one year and can transfer to a college to then become an RN for only an additional year.  (You can work as an LPN as you study to become an RN).  So, yes it is possible for you to become an RN in 2 years.  If you are a senior now, look at all of the programs near you NOW.  You need to apply because the spots to fill up quickly.  I hope this was helpful in your quest to becoming an RN.  If you can, brush up on your sciences.",526

The word ""Brain"" refers directly to the Cerebral cortex found in higher animals.  Ants are surprisingly intelligent nevertheless.  Ants, like other insects have networks of nerve cells called Ganglia.  Each ganglion is in charge of simpler tasks that help the simple organism cope with challenges presented by its habitat.

I have some foreign talent candidates that are interested. Is there a service to do this on your behalf or a recommended book to read.? ; Since you are new to this, you should consider retaining an immigration attorney.  The procedure is not rocket science, but requires some interaction with you state's Department of Labor (not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Labor) before you actually file the paperwork with the immigration.  \n\nLegal fees will probably run you about $2,000 per case (I've seen as low is $1,500 and as high as $5,000 with level of service completely uncorrelated to the price; a cheap lawyer can be as good or as bad as an expensive one); you will also have to pay a non-refundable filing fee of $1,500 per case to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  There may be other expenses, such as the cost of evaluating your prospective employee's education credentials (the law requires that H-1B workers hold at least a Bachelor's degree in the area of their proposed employment or a related area), but they are typically small compared to attorney fees and filing fees.  \n\nYou will be requried to post a notice to your employees about the fact that you are hiring H-1B workers and sign an affidavit stating that you in fact posted such notice.  \n\nYou should also remember that the best time to file for an H-1B is right after the beginning of the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1), so you should file in October or November.  Usually, USCIS stops accepting H-1B petitions in January or February, because the annual quota for H-1B visas gets filled.  If your attorney neglects to mention this at the initial interview (as some sleazy ones do), don't hire him; he is trying to charge you for putting together a petition that he knows full well will be rejected.\n\nIf you are in California, I can recommend a good attorney (knowledgeable, approachable, and reasonably priced) whom I have repeatedly used over the last few years.",536

Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?

They are:\n\n1+1=2\n1+2=3\n1+3=4\n1+4=5\n2+1=3\n2+2=4\n2+3=5\n2+4=6\n3+1=4\n3+2=5\n3+3=6\n3+4=7\n4+1=5\n4+2=6\n4+3=7\n4+4=8\n\nYour probabilites are:\n2: 1/16\n3: 2/16\n4: 3/16\n5: 4/16\n6: 3/16\n7: 2/16\n8: 1/16\n\n2,3,5 and 7 are prime, thus the probability of rolling a prime is (1+2+4+2)/16 or 9/16 exactly.",596

Being surrounded by as much talent as he is hurts his money making ability as hes looked upon as ""just"" another cog in the Phoenix Suns machine , whereas Jordan was the ""main "" cog in the Chicago Bulls machine. Do you think the Bulls come even close if Pippen leads that team without Jordan? Ok now compare that to Phoenix where you have Steve Nash, Amare Stoudamire, Shawn Marion and even Boris Diaw.

Some ""lottery"" teams however, have traded there draft picks for other players and are not part of the ""lottery"" (Knicks traded there 1st round pick to the Bulls for Eddie Curry).  \nAs for the picks themselves, the NBA uses a ping pong ball system.  The team that has the worst record will get the most amount of balls, the second worst gets the second most and so on, think KENO.  The balls are then chosen randomally to determine who picks first, second, etc. etc.  So even though the team with the worst record has more ping pong balls in the bowl, it doesn't necessarily mean they will choose first, they just have the best CHANCE.

I was reading in this physics book about the effects of global warming and it stated that the rising levels of harmful chemical gases in the earth's atmosphere could damage the earth forever.

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

4,"where can i get firefox and wil it work with windows xp home edition sp2? ; also does it work better than microsoft internet exploer and what kind of security features does it have ; Yes.  The main security feature of Firefox is the fact that it lacks ActiveX controls which is why IE has so many security holes... also IE is still far more common than Firefox so IE is attacked more then Firefox.  That doesn't mean there aren't exploits for Firefox but most of them are harmless and will just cause Firefox to crash and all you have to do is clear the cache and restart Firefox, no harm done.  The reason IE is so terrible is because the ActiveX controls are tied into the operating system so it is possible should an exploit be present, for someone to hijack your system.  I know of no such exploit for Firefox, though, I could be wrong.\n\nJust use Firefox, it's better, http://www.mozilla.com/",719

Like the resolution should be 352x288 or 352x240, only accept 30fps (for PAL) or 25fps (for NTSC) you also have to use 1150kpbs as the bitrate.\nIf you don't want to create this manually. Many programs offer straight conversion into VCD format (that is still mpg or MPEG-1). The popular one is Nero 7. See it on www.nero.com. It includes a program to convert video files into VCD format, just click and it's done! This program can also convert avi files into VCD format.\nSorry, there's nothing you can do with the VCD that you've made, you must reencode the files and burn a new VCD. But, you can still play it using PC =p Good luck!",802

Instead, people vote for individual representatives in parliament for their district (like how we vote for Representatives), and the party that receives a majority of seats (or coalition of parties if none has a majority) votes for who among them should be prime minister.\n\nIn countries that have both, the President has very little power and is mainly a ceremonial position, much like the Queen in England.",876

The molar mass is 164 g. You only have 156 g, which means you have 0.95 moles (156/164). Now you know that you have half as many moles of oxygen, therefore you only have 0.475 moles of O2.

1,"can 2+2 = anything other than 4? ; i have a bet running with a friend about logic. he thinks that no fact can be disproved with consistant logic. i think it can. leaving the bet aside for a moment can anyone prove logicaly that 2+2 dose not = 4? ; The modular (and clock) arithmetic answers are correct, but I think they miss the point a bit, since in any modular arithmetic you still have 2+2 = 4 mod n. Let's suppose we are using the natural numbers with the usual addition.\n\nThe recurring decimal answers are just stupid, 1 = 0.9999... recurring (as shown in fact by the first answer here), so all of these answers are either irrelevant or wrong.\n\nThe '2' is just a symbol arguments possibly have some merit, but you should be careful. In Indianna in 1872 (or thereabouts) it was ruled by State legislature, that the value of pi is 4. Obviously this creates problems, if you go to Indianna you won't find many buildings that were designed in 1872. (Their mistake of course was that they didn't alter the representation of all the other numbers they where using accordingly).\n\nI'm not really a logician so I don't know the answer to this off the top of my head, I'm pretty sure that we don't have a satisfying answer here (sorry if we have but I missed it). \n\nPerhaps a good place to start looking for a serious discussion on this kind of topic would be to understand what a Peano system is (wiki it, I'm not explaining that here, 'tis an axiomatic description of the natural numbers).

1,"whats -16x squared + 80x + 3? ; i think u have to solve it by binomiels but i cant think of 2 numbers that multiple to 16 and add to 80. its a parabala and i have to graph it please help ; y = -16x^2 +80x +3\n\nFirst of all, it is a negative quadratic function, so, you expect this quadratic function to open downwards. Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943

6,"i need advice on how to make money on real estate buy remodel and sell? ; i have 10 + years carpentery exp drywall painting hardwood floor install sand finish ; Remember you only make money when you BUY a property, not when you sell it.  That means that you have to ""make"" your money when you buy the house.  Make sure you have enough equity in the house upfront to:\n\n1.  Repair the house for sale.  This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).

I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963

Help... ; ""Almost all people with gout have hyperuricaemia (too much uric acid in the blood). However not everyone with hyperuricaemia has gout. Uric acid is a normal waste product from the breakdown of purines. Purines are found in most foods but some foods are much richer in purine content. Uric acid is normally dissolved in blood and removed through the kidneys. Hyperuricaemia is the result of either the body producing too much uric acid or the kidneys not clearing it fast enough."" \n\nExcess uric acid deposits crystals in the joints, causing the very painful episodes.

CRM systems are integrated end-to-end across marketing, sales, and customer service.\n\nA CRM system should:\n\nIdentify factors important to clients. \nPromote a customer-oriented philosophy \nAdopt customer-based measures \nDevelop end-to-end processes to serve customers \nProvide successful customer support \nHandle customer complaints \nTrack all aspects of sales \nCreate a holistic view of customers' sales & services information",1083

Typing isn't just slow in Word. It's slow in emails and on the Web and everything else. Is there anything I can do to speed it up? I have Mac OS Extended. ; A G3 isn't exactly the lastest in computer technology.

In a healthy individual, calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship, that means that when one goes up, the other goes down.  Serum calcium tends to decrease i people who have osteoporosis or inadequate intake of calcium.  Calcium needs Vitamin D to aid in absorption.  Eat foods high in calcium, or take supplements with both Vit D and Calcium. Calcium supplements should be taken 1-2 hrs after a meal to increase intestinal absorption.\nIs your low calcium-high phosphorus levels caused by an underlying condition, such as renal failure, Crohn's disease, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease?  Is it caused by improper functioning of the thyroid and parathyroid glands? If so, the underlying condition must be treated in order for the mineral balance to be restored, thus allowing more calcium to be absorbed.\nSee your Doctor, to treat the underlying problem, then add calcium and Vit D to your diet.",1122

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",1179

Also is not homogeneous like other materials (actually is a composite material, made from pebbles, stones and cement in water).\nThat's why the drill bits for this kind of things act exactly like rotating chisel. It has an leading edge hat is acting axial (along the axis of the drilling bit) and the bit is made from the most strongest carbides (VC, TiC, WC, etc mixed with the metallic powder techniques).\nThat's only because a drill bit  made for wood/metal would be destroyed at the very first millimeters. \n\nIt's acting by hitting then rotating few degrees and then hitting again and so on (that's why I called it ""rotating chisel"" and its bit is acting along the axis of the drilling rod).\nThe metal/wood drilling bits are acting like knifes which are ""shaving"" the face of the material bit by bit, actually making a spiral (a continuous chip) with the chips no thicker than 1 millimeter, no matter the size of the drilling bits. In the same way the masonry drilling bits are not fitted to drill wood/metal.\n\nDfriend:)",1213

Lavasoft's free Ad-Aware is the best antispyware to my knowledge. Also Windows Defender from Microsoft is good enough for real-time protection). This should identify the problem and most probably would solve it as well. However, if the antivirus software is unable to delete the malware, go to thier website and search for the name of the malware detected. Their must be some instructions posted to tackle the problem. You might have to delete the system restore points and as well delete the particular registry entries manually if the virus still regenerates on subsequent boot up of the machine. Good Luck.\n\nPS.

They are independent of the states in which those reservations reside and could almost be considered as a form of even more independent state than those 50 that already exist. They have their own police forces, tribal governments, and laws. This is one reason why Indian tribes can have casinos or tobacco shops on their lands even when the state they reside in forbids gambling or charges higher tobacco taxes than the reservation does. Yet, American Indians are basically dual citizens--of both their Indian nation and the United States--and are required to carry out the duties, rights and responsiblities of both communities; including the right to vote in local, state and federal elections.",1238

1,"Soil Conservation? ; CausesConsequencesSolutions\nSoil Erosion•••\nDesertification\n\nSalinization•••\n•••\n\nDescribing ways in which your lifestyle directly or indirectly contributes to Soil degradation. ; Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms (in the case of bioerosion). Although the processes may be simultaneous, erosion is to be distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock. Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n\nA certain amount of erosion is natural and in fact healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continually move downstream in watercourses. Too much erosion, however, can cause problems, clogging streams with gravel, filling reservoirs with sediment, reducing soil fertility and water\n \ncauses : What causes erosion to be severe in some areas and minor elsewhere? It is a combination of many factors, including the amount and intensity of precipitation, the texture of the soil, the gradient of the slope, ground cover (from vegetation, rocks, etc.) and land use. The first factor, rain, is the agent for erosion, but the degree of erosion is governed by other factors.\n\nThe first three factors can remain fairly constant over time. In general, given the same kind of vegetative cover, you expect areas with high-intensity precipitation, sandy or silty soils, and steep slopes to be the most erosive. Soils with a lot of clay that receive less intense precipitation and are on gentle slopes tend to erode less.\n\nThe factor that is most subject to change is the amount and type of ground cover. When fires burn an area or when vegetation is removed as part of timber operations, building a house or a road, the susceptibility of the soil to erosion is greatly increased.\n\ncontrol : Examples of some erosion control methods include:\n\nconservation tillage \ncontour plowing \ncover crops \ngabions \nhydroseeding \nreforestation \nriparian strips \nriprap \nstrip farming \nvegetated waterways \nterracing \nwattle (construction) \nwindbreaks",1267

Should I pay it off early? ; That all depends on your financial situation, long-term goals, interest rate, etc...\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\n1) Your house is a LIABILITY - unless it puts money IN your pocket, it's a liability.  It's an asset on the BANK's balance sheet.  Tax write offs...sure, but look at how much interest you'll pay over the course of the loan.  Figure that you'll basically pay double for the loan.  If you can pay it off in 20 years vs 30, you'll save thousands in interest.  If you invested that into a mutual fund, real estate (rental property or buy/flip), you'd stand to make a lot more than a write off.\n\n2)  What's your overall debt situation?  Do you have lots of credit cards, loans, dept store cards, etc...?  If you can make the mortgage payments, and you have a lot of cc debt, it may make more sense to pay off the higher interest rate debt first.  \n\nConsult with a financial expert / tax expert etc... for specific advice.\n\nI would also point you to ""Smart Women / Couples Finish Rich"", by David Bach.

He refused untold requests to publish them during his lifetime. \nMadison was the last surviving signer of the Constitution. \nDuring his terms in office, Congress passed resolutions calling on Madison to issue religiously-tinged proclamations of thanksgiving, to which he assented. During his retirement, Madison composed his ""Detached Memorandum,"" in which he assailed such proclamations as violations of church-state separation. \nIn 2006, historians ranked Madison's failure to avoid war as the #6 worst Presidential mistake. \nMadison was the first U.S. President who had not previously held the office of Vice President. (Washington does not qualify since there was no office of V.P. prior to his Presidency). \nBoth of Madison's Vice Presidents, George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry, died in office. \nMadison's portrait was on the U.S. $5000 bill. There were about twenty different varieties of $5000 bills issued between 1861 and 1946; all but three featured James Madison. He also appears on the $200 Series EE Savings Bond. \nAt 5 feet, 4 inches in height (163 cm) and 100 pounds (45 kg), Madison was the nation's shortest and lightest president. \nMadison was frequently ill. He was too frail for military service during the Revolution. \nNephew James M. Rose was killed at the Battle of the Alamo.  \nSeveral counties, towns, cities and universities were named after James Madison. a few: Madison County, Ohio ; Madison, Wisconsin; Madison, Georgia; James Madison College (Michigan State Univ.); James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. \nHis last words were, ""I always talk better lying down.""",1382

(eg. public service ads).\n\n\nPlease also see similar question on use of silence... ; Music is a vitally important ingredient in TV advertising. To see how cleverly it is used, record a few on video and play them over a few times. My best example is Pampers where a mother asks a baby to get up from the floor and walk over to her and father says the baby cannot move because of the nappy. The music is baby-like during this phase. The ad then cuts to the benefits of Pampers and then back to the baby who does get up and walk across the room. Almost imperceptibly, the music changes to a kind of triumphal sound. On one watching, you would be unaware of it. Only by playing the ad over can you hear the mood that is created. In answer to your other questions, try replaying and noting how many different camera set ups there were in a 15 or 30 second ad, then analyse the story being told, then listen to see how sound, including music, adds atmosphere.",1459
7,"Why does in naruto, every character wears white stripes on their right leg? ; Why? ; I have been wondering that too!!!\nWHY????\nI really want to know! Does anyone know why?\n\nAt first I thought it was just a weird anime character design, but I don’t think that is it.  It has to have more meaning…  Then I thought maybe it helps them fight?  Maybe they use that leg more, so the bandages might help constrain the leg from twisting it funny or stretching their muscles while fighting, so they will be less likely to get injured!  Don't know, just a thought...\n:-P\n\nAdded:\nHey, I think I know why!  Look at this picture:\nhttp://www.asylum-anime.com/pboards/naruto-0204C.jpg\nSee where the bandages are at?  He has a strap fastened around his leg, over the bandages, with a bag that holds more weapons.  So, the bandages are there to help hold the weapons in place!  I don’t know how to describe it…  \n\nBut it holds his clothes closer to him, so that it will not get in the way when he reaches for the weapons.  It also has a greater chance that the weapons will not move because the clothes will not move and possibility loosen the straps.  Also, it will help so that their legs, where they have the bag of weapons fasten to, won’t get irritated from constantly rubbing against their skin.  It gives extra padding!!!  And not all of the ninjas have the bandages on that leg!  One of the sounds group (I think it was the sounds, it was in the episode where they are in the death forest) had the bandages on the other leg.  Sasuke makes a point about this when one of them pretends they are Naruto, but has the bandages on the wrong leg!  It's because the sound guy is left handed!  Everything makes sense now!!!\n\nYea!  I'm so happy now!\n\nSorry, I know that I’m writing in circles…  I’m very bad at describing things…",1460

What could it be? ; I have the same problem with my hands- especially in colder weather. Do you only keep lotion on them when they're cracked? If so, then that's probably where the problem is. You need to keep lotion on them all the time. Also, make sure that when you wash your hands, you dry them completely and NEVER go outside in cold weather with wet hands!

She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

I could completely understand if she felt that the music went against her religious beliefs but she listens to Tori Amos and Dave Matthews...last time I checked they weren't performing Ritual sacrafice on stage...I think she is being religiously trendy as i call it. ; HI Derek,\nGood question. Obviously I do not know what your friend's church background is. Although what she is doing is appropriate from a Biblical standpoint, she might be legalistic in her approach (Overly stiff, following a rule as though its the ONLY way to do something). But let's assume that she is a Christian that simply desires to walk with God in a close manner. There's a ""fancy"" word called sanctification. It means to be set apart. Both the Old Testament and the New are full of stories and commands that depict that God expects his people to NOT look like the non-believing people. So that alone could cause your friend to choose Christian music over secular. Have you listened to the words in secular music lately Derek? They've always talked about love, but they are now often filled with a lot of profanity, sex even violence. Christians are called to not purposely fill their minds with those things (Romans 12:1-2) because as a man thinks so he acts...(Proverbs 23:7) so if we fill our minds with negative thoughts, we tend to be very pessimistic. The same is true with any thoughts - garbage in - garbage out!\n\nWhen a person becomes a Christian they are set apart by Christ - He calls them to change, to leave what was behind and press ahead to what God has called them to do- He provides the power (Ephesians 5) but as a Christian we are under new ownership (2 Corinthians 5:17-21). If you are not a Christian, that may seem very odd, but it makes sense that if you have a new ""boss"" at work, you do things his way - especially if that boss is smart, loving and giving like God. Why wouldn't you want to follow him? \n\nAnyway, you asked, where in the Bible does it say....the problem in answering is: where does it not say that. I could quote passage after passage, but I think you see my point. \n\nFrankly, Christians SHOULD be involved as engineers, scientists, musicians, doctors and everything else. Christians are called to be salt and light to a world (Matthew %:13-14) which Jesus says is corrupted and is dying (He died to save people who recognize that and turn to Him). Perhaps your friend is overdoing it a bit - but perhaps this is her way of saying, enough is enough, and she's trying to run form her junky past and begin living more consistently for God. I hope you will be patient and supportive. \n\nHope that helps.\n\nMy best,\nProf Mark\nhttp://prof-mark.com",1637

After initiating a disastrous program of economic, military and diplomatic actions coupled with severe domestic security measures, Bush's administration collapsed under a wave of scandals. The impact of his presidency on America's international standing is still felt today. According to an obscure satirist of the period, ""George W. Bush was the a**hole that ate the world."" ; I agree with the statement following the question.

I am graduating from a university in 2008 with a degree in criminal justice. I am looking at one agency in particular, Diplomatic Security. Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

3,"Can you explain the Anglo-Saxon poem called The Wife's Lament? ; I can't seem to find a summary online.  Best answer gets 10pts! ; ok summer here is the best i got:\n\nThis poem is (obviously) a lament, or some sorrow for something lost, also known as an elegy.  In this case, the poem is a woman's song.  She is lamenting the loss of her lover (it is possible that he is simply not there, or absent).  \nHowever, it appears as if ""her lord"" is the same lord that governs the people in this poem.  Therefore, for some reason they are isolating her from him.  Her lord himself tells her to take up a ""dwelling"" that he has apparently appointed for her.  \nOnce there, she meets a man and falls in love with him, claiming that ""death alone"" would separate them.\nFor the remainder of the poem, the woman is expressing her deep grief as she is in exile in what seems to be some type of cave or tunnell in the ground.\n\nhere is a paragraph by paragraph analysis:\n1.  \nHere she is introducing her lament as a sorrowful tale of her utmost woe; that never before has she experienced any distress as dire or excruciating as this.\n\n2.\nhere she explains that her lords family/ gentry sent him on a sea journey.  ""Dawn-cares"" can be interpreted as she either worries about him so much, she is losing sleep, or she wakes up in the morning, and her 1st thought is her husband.  [These compound words are famous in anglo-saxon poetry.]  She decides to go into exile, which was a custom of women to do who were w/o there husbands.  She may have disgraced him and is thencforth banishing herself.  It seems that she is turning to his people for advice, and they have their own plans as to where she should go.  The scheme and plot to send her away and put her in a position which will forever keep them apart. \n\n3.\nHer lord confirms the dwelling place she is to go to.  Where she went for exile, she knows few people.\n\n4.  \nShe falls in love with a man who is depressive and well taken care of.  He also seems to be in exile w/ a broken heart...he may even be suicidal.  They vow together, that, in their exile, they will have eachother.  But, he kills himself, destroying their pact.  she is back to where she stared in her sorrow.\n\n5.  \nFillied with longing, she is sent to live in a cave or some sort of underground hovel.  \n\n6. She describes her surroundings as dismal and ""briar-choked"".  She bemoans that fact that loves walk the earth and experience joy, while she is condemned to despair.  She explains that she can never gain composure because she used to be so full of hope, promise, and she was enthused for life.  Now that everything is taken from her, she is torn.  She takes a turn to curse her lord and wish upon him sorrow and grief, that he may become lost and wandering in his journeys.  She wished upon him a brooding heart and ""breast cares"" (broken heart). \n\nWell, I really hope this helps you!! Good luck with everything!  I will also email this to u so u get it.",1774

1,"what is meant by death ?how death occurs?what are all the changes takes place in the cellular level? ; i wan t to know about the biochemical changes occur in our body after death and of course about the parameters pH,and so on ; This is a more complex question than it seems. In order to fully define Death we would have to fully define Life, and that has not been done yet. Life can be described, and there is the Cell Theory of Life, but what 'life' is, no one can say yet.\nHowever, it is plain that everything living moves somehow, and that it reproduces somehow, and that whatever is living must use and excrete whatever substances it needs in order to keep on living. In most cases we are talking here about nutrition and respiration, respiration being the more critical. When respiration ceases either on a cellular level or throughout the entire organism, everything shuts down, because chemical reactions in the cells and between them can no longer take place. Some bacteria will go into a spore stage when this happens, and can thus survive extremes of temperatures and dehydration (like anthrax and TB). Generally in the absence of oxygen, cells lose their ph balance and become acidic, which upsets all chemical reactions in the cell. Conversely, anaerobic bacteria like botulism, when exposed to oxygen, go through a similar process of having all chemical reactions messed up.\nTherefore, although we cannot say what exactly 'death' is, we recognize it in animals by: an absence of respiration, an absence of pulse, an absence of reflexes (due to brain and nerve death), an absence of sensation, an absence of conciousness, and an inability to eat or reproduce. It is further noted by an absence of brain wave activity.\nIn plants death is noted by an inability to rehydrate, lack of response to stimuli, inability to reproduce or respire, and limpness.\nIn microbes, death is noted by an absence of cell division or reproduction, or by bursting of the cell walls.",1809

It's a pretty sizeable amount of money that he can only get when he is 18, is there a good way to invest this money so that it will make him money it's just going to sit in an account for the next 8 years the way it is now. ; Yahoo! is good for some answers, not for others. Ask your lawyer to recommend a stockbroker or financial advisor, and ask him/her this question.\n\nThere is a thing called risk-return ratio. The more you risk, the higher the (possible) return. If you put the money in a CD, it will get 3% - 5% and be as safe as you can get. Other investment have higher risks. To take an extreme example, if you put $1,000 into a one-year CD at 4%, at the end of the year you'd have $1,004, unless the US Government collapsed. \n\nIf, on the other hand, you flew to Las Vegas and put your $1,000 on ""Red"" at a roulette table, at the end of 45 seconds you'd have either $2,000 or nothing. Roulette carries a lot of risk, but the returns are high.\n\nStocks, bonds, mutual funds, real estate partnerships, rare coins and stamps, uncut diamonds, race horses, classic muscle cars, old paintings - there are risks and possible returns with all of them. You have to decide how much risk you are comfortable with. Any banker, stockbroker or financial advisor worthy of the name will tell you the same thing. \n\nLong-term CD's are guaranteed by the FDIC; they almost always have the highest return for virtually no risk. 1-year CD's are running about 4.12% today (see link).\n\nIf the finacial advisor you go to has a sure-fire way to get over 8% a year, with NO risk, put one hand onyour wallet and walk away, slowly, never taking your eyes off his hands.\n\nThere are ways to get a 10%, 20% or 30% return on your money. They all carry some amount of risk of a 10%, 50% or 100% loss. The higher the potential return, the higher the potential risk.",1813

The people of the Caucasian Isthmus, Khaldi people (or Khalib/Halyb and Halisones by Strabo) were one of the oldest west-Georgian tribes (4th to 2nd millennia BC).\n\nBy 2500 BCE to 2000 BCE, increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product) appear in Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Egypt[citation needed]. However, their use appears to be ceremonial, and iron was an expensive metal, more expensive than gold[citation needed, especially as regards to pricing concerning gold, as the word is often confused with ""bronz"" in ancient texts].",1845

5,"Good question for BEARS fans? ; IF GROSSMAN IS ON, THEN WHO WOULD WIN IF THE 1985 BEARS PLAYED THE 2006 BEARS ; Easy one! There is no doubt whatsoever that the 1985 Bear would crush today's or the 2006 Bears.\n\nThe 1985 team was far more resourceful; it also had much better depth at each position. In 1985 one didn't ask, ""...if Grossman is on..."" because even if McMahon wasn't on one didn't wonder about the win--it was more of a question of by how much.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the 85' Chicago Bears were one of, if not the best football team of all time. They were also the team that started the ""Demolition Derby"" Super Bowl by just crushing the Pats, by the way, who was an excellent team.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, 85' had Big Mike Ditka who revolutionized the game by doing what it took to win all the way to the ""Fridge"".",1878

How do sex offenders get off with only a few years and some have to serve longer. shouldn't they all serve the same if they commited the  same cime. How do people often get off due to loop holes and technicallities that the attorney finds to get them off.

1,"is oxygen flammable? ; will oxygen burn by itself without a fuel source? ; The answer is resoundingly NO.   Oxygen is NOT a fuel.  Flames, fire and all related chemical reactions are a result of a FUEL being OXIDIZED, or being combined with oxygen. The application of oxygen to a burning fuel will cause the fire to burn much more vigorously, as well as hotter.  \n\nOxygen, by itself, WILL NOT BURN.  If it did, our atmosphere (which is 20.9% oxygen) would have burned up a long time ago.\n\nOxygen is mixed with a number of different fuel sources to get a faster, hotter burn.  Acetylene, used in metal cutting torches, is mixed with oxygen to get a super hot flame that will quickly cut through metal.\n\nNASA uses oxygen to burn hydrogen fuel, not only to get a fast burn required in a rocket engine, but also because surrounding oxygen in the atmosphere becomes much more scarce as you leave the atmosphere for space.",1911

Side by side?\n\nIf the Great Flood did happen, shouldn't the fish be on the top layer instead of near the bottom? Since fish would've survived in the ocean during the Great Flood ...?\n\nNo, ""devil created fossils"" or ""it was God's magic"" answers. Logical answers only please. ; You are right.\n\nCenturion: I hope that you only are asking this question sarcastically, in order to give an example of the silly questions that creationists ask, so nobody has to explain that obviously species take separate evolutionary paths, based on their environment, so that the same species in different environments will eventually evolve into different species.\n\nUnknown: What do you mean by a fossil of a creature turning into something else?  That doesn't really make much sense, seeing how all creatures are in the process of turning into ""something else"" - we just don't know what the future of evolution holds.  Haven't you heard about the recent discovery of the fossil of the ""fish"" which helps to provide evidence of the transition of animals from water to land?  I don't really know what you mean by saying that there are no ""missing links"" - there are thousands of them!  I just ahve the feeling that no number of missing links would be sufficient.  Between any two species it will always be possible ask for a ""linking"" fossil, and since there cannot be an infinite number of fossils, it will always be theoretically possible to say that no missing links have been found.\n\nmamcrackin: http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12200044CLXE\nsee my comment above that no number of misssing links will ever be able to ""prove"" evolution.  If half-man/half-animal were found (and they have been, just look at all the fossils of the earlier human species) creationists would just ask for 3/4 man, 1/4 animal fossils, and then 7/8 man, 1/8 animal, and so on.  \n\nindiebaptist: Her point is that while there would be fish fossils evenly dispersed throughout the layers of earth, non-aquatic animals would be clumped in one layer - the layer during which the flood occurred.  This is not what we find when looking at the fossils in the layers of earth.  The great flood was also gods way of killing a lot of animals who had done nothing to deserve that punishment. by the way, hovind's PhD (from a non accredited school) is in christian education, not biology or any other science. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind  \nI really have to wonder where you are getting your facts from.

1,"What is proportional convergence logic ? ; Is this the same as fuzzy logic or not ? ; In a quick Google search, the only documents using the exact phrase ""proportional convergence logic"" that turned up were discussing the ability of certain advanced targeting systems on surface-to-air missiles such as the SA-16 and SA-18 to home in on the center of mass of an aircraft rather than its engines.  As the missile approaches its target, the onboard sensors detect the heat radiation from the airframe (which is hot, due to friction with air, but much cooler than the jet engine exhaust), allowing the guidance system to direct the missile toward the center of the airframe, rather than toward the tail of the craft.  This makes it more likely that the missile will impact the aircraft in such a way as to destroy it in the air, rather than grazing it or perhaps even missing it altogether, as it might if it targeted only the hottest mass in its sensor field.  The closer the missile comes to its target, the more it takes into account the returns from the less heated portions of the aircraft -- I gather that this is the ""proportional convergence"" property of the guidance system.",2007

He spent his childhood in khawrazm.He was interested in Biological studying as gathering samples of plants and seeds for a Greek scientist.\n  \nHis studies\n\nHe began studies at a very early age under the famous astronomer and mathematician ''Abu Nasr Mansur''. Khwarazm was at this time,  the center of scientists and researchers. His contemporary well-known physician and scientist, Ibn Sina (Avicenna),  at this time lived in khawrazm. They met each other  to discuss about different biological subjects. Biruni left his native country at the age of 22 or 25 to the Khorasan, Rey, Tabarestan and Jurajan. He pursued knowledge in its various branches, and learned much of astronomy, mathematics, geography, physics and chemistry.For some years he lived in Jurjan. He wrote ''Athar al-Bqiah'' ,one of his great works, there. Biruni wrote it on the chronology of different nations and intelligently discusses the debatable theory of the rotation of the earth on its axis and accurately determines the longitudes and latitudes. The ruler of Jurjan ''Qabus Weshmgir'' offered him premiership but he refused. He cameback to his home. when Sultan Mahmood Ghaznawi conquered his homeland, summoned Biruni and some other top scientists at his court. He provided generous support for their scientific work.\n\n \n\nHis journey to India\nSultan Mahmud took Biruni along with in his journeys to India several times and thus he had the opportunity to travel all over India during a period of 20 years. He learnt Hindu philosophy, mathematics, geography and religion and collecting material for his books Kitab-ul-Hind and Al Qanoon-al-Masoodi.In ''Kitab-ul-Hind'', his well-known book, he gives a very authentic account of the language, customs, manners, literature, laws and beliefs of the Hindus. He also describes the geographical and physical conditions of the country. He also translated two Sanskrit books into Arabic which deals with the creation of things and what happens after the spirit leaves the body.\nOn his return from India, Biruni wrote his other famous book Qanoon-al- Masoodi which dedicated to Sultan Masood; discussing several theorems of astronomy, trigonometry, solar, lunar, and planetary motions and relative topics.

What causes the cancer is all the other crap that tobacco companies mix in with the tobacco to make the cigarettes and cigars taste better and burn better. I have read that the American Native people who smoke only dried tobacco leaves have a very low incidence of lung cancer.\nOf course today we also have all the wonderful polution in the air from chemical plants and car exhaust plus the pollution of the water by chemical plants who produce chemical fertilizers for golf courses and farms and people's lawns.

0,"Why do people keep talking about agnostics believing in a god? ; From Merriam-Webster:\n\nMain Entry: 1ag·nos·tic \nPronunciation: ag-'näs-tik, &g-\nFunction: noun\nEtymology: Greek agnOstos unknown, unknowable, from a- + gnOstos known, from gignOskein to know -- more at KNOW\n1 : a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable; broadly : one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god\n2 : a person unwilling to commit to an opinion about something <political agnostics> \n- ag·nos·ti·cism  /-t&-""si-z&m/ noun \n\n\nNotice that first definition... doesn't believe or disbelieve in God or a god.\n\n\nIf you are agnostic, you do not believe in a deity, nor do you deny a deity.\n\nIf you believe in a deity, you're a theist, not agnostic. ; I think they're referring to agnostic theists, those who think there is no way to know absolutely if there is a god, but believe in one anyway.\n\nAccording to Theism, the opinion that gods or deities exist, and Agnosticism is that existence unknown or inherently unknowable. Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

I think that there is no black whole at the center of galaxies, I believe that the gravitational pull off all the stars at the center are pulling as well as pushing away. So stars are actually either being aborbed into bigger stars >> that's why its brighter toward the center >> or the more stars that are being pulled in toward the center of the galaxy are dancing around each other making the center of the galaxy spin faster >> from our perspective we cannot tell what's really going on at the center of the galaxy.\n\nWhat do you think is really happening? ; Most people *don't* believe galaxies are black holes.  A black hole is a region of space from which nothing can escape, even light.  \n\nSince you can't see a black hole (that light that isn't escaping), one has to rely on indirect evidence.  \n\n If you've found a large mass concentrated in a small volume, and if the mass is dark, then it's a good guess that there's a black hole there.  \n\nIt'll be quite some time before we can get ""hard evidence"" of a black hole.

Divorce is really hard on the children and being raised by a single parent is sometimes difficult. All my son's friends are being raised by a single parent. Most of them come to our home to eat dinner and get dessert which they don't get at home. They hang out at our house cos their parents are out on the weekends trying to find another mate.

Only nine skeletons were in the grave. There should have been eleven. Two of Nicholas II's children were not there. Russian experts who examined the bones concluded, from photographic superimposition, that daughter, Maria, and son, Alexei, were missing.

0,"Warfare: good or bad? ; I'm not looking for fence-sitting answers here. I already know that there are many reasons to argue both for and against warfare.

Would you hesitate before choosing or jump right in?\n\nThe background to this question is this:\n\nRecently I asked here whether the world would be better off had gunpowder never been invented.

The itching has still lasted until today, and I am not alarmed by that, as it may take a few days for the Monistat cream to cure it. \n\nBut I noticed a little itchy bump on my vulva. And the skin all around it is itching terribly. The bump is definately not sore to the touch...just itches like hell. So does the rest of that area! It's getting on my nerves. \n\nNow, my boyfriend is a little worried. Could it be herpes? I've never had sexual intercourse with a man who was infected with it, but I am still worried. Or does this seem like usual yeast infection business? Someone please help. ; Don't freak out. It could possibly be a folliculitis (which is a hair bump) or bacterial vaginosis. The best advice I could give you is to pay the doctor a visit. Since you have never been with a person who has a herpes infection, I wouldn't be too worried about it.\n\nBut also know, that if a person has a cold sore, it is a herpes virus. If they perform oral sex on you with an active cold sore, you can develop a herpese infection in your genital area. A person who has genital herpes but isn't currently having an outbreak can still transmit the disease. The only reason why I am telling you these things is because I never knew until someone told me. \n\ntry not to worry too much and take care of yourself",2281

1,"Normal subgroups of GL(n, R)? ; In particular, does GL(n, R) have a compact  normal subgroup? Which? If not, what are normal subgroups in GL(n, R)? ; Every group has a compact normal subgroup, namely the identity.  \nAs noted, the scalar matrices form the center of your group G.  Therefore the two-element subgroup {plus/minus I} is also normal in G.\n\nAs noted, the group SL_n is normal in G.  Therefore if H is also normal in G, its intersection H' with SL_n is normal in SL_n.  It is known that if H' is a normal subgroup of SL_n, then H' is contained in the scalar matrices, which are trivial if n is odd and {plus/minus I} if n is even.\n\nIf H is not equal to H' it must contain a matrix of determinant not equal to 1.  If this determinant is not plus/minus 1, then H is not compact.  Let us note that the set of matrices with determinant plus/minus 1 is a normal subgroup of G containing SL_n.\nFor that matter, also note that the set of matrices with positive determinant is normal in G.\n\nThis discussion should enable you to classify the normal subgroups of GL_n.  If you mean *Lie* subgroups we are done.  \nIn particular, there are exactly two compact ones, already noted.",2294

1,"Theory of relativity  and the twin paradox: is the aging biological? ; The twin paradox is a very well-known example to present the theory of relativity. One of twins jumps into a space ship and the other one stays on Earth. Each of the twins moves in relation to each other. The traveler-twin, once back on Earth, is younger than the twin who stayed. \n\nWhat I don't understand is what this aging really means. I DO understand that the watches each of them is wearing show a difference in time. But does the traveler really change BIOLOGICALLY? Does he ""look younger"" than the other twin? In practice, would the traveler-twin get gray hair later than the other twin? Or does aging in this context mean something else? So my question, shortly put, is: does aging in the context of theory of relativity mean 1)just impression that time is going faster on Earth than in space  2)real changes in biology, real physical aging? The twin who returns back from the space ship journey: does he look exactly as old as the other twin or has he really remained younger? ; Yes.  It means that for the twin that stayed on Earth, the time really passed for him, and for the twin who traveled, less time passed.\nThe older twin doesnt just ""look"" older, he really is older.

If you have a rally which requires a lot of short sharp movement, it may take your body a moment or two before it realises that a lot of oxygen is needed for recovery. \nThis can result in a sudden increase in heart rate. \nThis is not a good thing for those who lack fitness\n\nCheck the link for much more info!\nGood luck!",2383

Only Web.\nThank you. ; 250 Bettina was discovered by Johann Palisa on September 3, 1885 in Vienna. It was named in honour of Baroness Bettina von Rothschild, the wife of the prominent Viennese banker Albert Salomon von Rothschild who had bought the nameing rights for £50\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild (October 29, 1844 - February 11, 1911) was a banker in Austria-Hungary and a member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria.\n\nBorn in Vienna, he was the youngest child of Anselm von Rothschild (1803-1874) and Charlotte von Rothschild (1807-1859). Known in the family as ""Salbert,"" he was educated in Vienna and Brünn\n\nOn his father's death in 1874, brothers Nathaniel and Ferdinand inherited most of the family's real estate and art collection. However, the family business went to Albert including the S M von Rothschild bank, the single largest shareholding in the Creditanstalt, and the shares in the Northern Railway. After two generations in Austria, communications between his family and the Rothschilds in England had diminished considerably but Albert wisely reinstated the regular exchange of vital information on current economic matters and politics in their respective countries.\n\nIn 1876, Albert von Rothschild married Baroness Bettina Caroline de Rothschild (1858-1892) of Paris, France, daughter of Alphonse James de Rothschild. They had the following children:\n\nGeorg Anselm Alphonse (March 22, 1877 - January 10, 1934), never married, he died in a private mental hospital and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \nAlfons Maier (1878-1942) \nCharlotte Esther (1879-1885) \nLudwig (Louis) Nathaniel (1882-1955) \nEugène Daniel (1884-1976) \nValentine Noémi (1886-1969) \nOskar Ruben (1888-1909), never married, at age 21 he committed suicide and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \n\nAlbert von Rothschild owed several large properties including the Palais Albert Rothschild at Prinz-Eugen-Straße 20-22, in the IV. district Wieden district of Vienna designed by the French architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur and built between 1876 and 1882.\n\nIn December of 1887 Albert and his wife were given the right to be presented at Court, the first time such a privilege had been granted in Austria to persons of the Jewish faith. Albert continued the family's involvement in the arts and with philanthropic projects. An avid chess player, he sponsored tournaments and in 1872 became president and patron of the Vienna chess society and took a special interest in institutions that provided assistance to Jewish artists and musicians. Following his wife's passing in 1892 at the young age of thirty-four, in her memory Albert von Rothschild built the Bettina Frauenspital (Bettina Hospital for Women) and a Bettina Rothschild begonia was named for her. A benefactor of the Vienna Observatory, the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named the large Main belt asteroid he discovered in 1885 the 250 Bettina in her honor.\n\nAlbert was awarded the Iron Cross of Merit in 1893 for his role in Austro-Hungarian monetary reform.\n\nWhen his unmarried and childless brother Nathaniel died in 1905, Albert inherited his Palais Rothschild at 14-16 Theresianumgasse in Vienna along with its large collection of art.\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild died in Vienna in 1911 and was interred next to his wife and their six-year-old daughter Charlotte in the city's Zentralfriedhof. In recognition of Albert von Rothschild's years of financial support, the 719 Albert Amor asteroid was named in his memory by astronomer Johann Palisa.",2410

Relations were strained following the tainted re-election of former President Fujimori in June 2000, but improved with the installation of an interim government in November 2000 and the inauguration of the government of Alejandro Toledo in July 2001. The United States continues to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and human rights safeguards in Peru and the integration of Peru into the world economy. \nThe United States and Peru cooperate on efforts to interdict the flow of narcotics, particularly cocaine, to the United States. Bilateral programs are now in effect to reduce the flow of drugs on Peru's extensive river system and to perform ground interdiction in tandem with successful law enforcement operations. The United States is considering whether to resume cooperation on an aerial interdiction program. The United States and Peru cooperate on promoting programs of alternative development in coca-growing regions. \nU.S. investment and tourism in Peru have grown substantially in recent years. U.S. exports to Peru were valued at $3.5 billion in 2005, accounting for 30.3% of Peru's imports. In the same year, Peru exported $5 billion in goods to the United States, accounting for about 30% of Peru's exports to the world. \nAbout 200,000 U.S. citizens visit Peru annually for business, tourism, and study.

Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

There's several places he could get sent for an unaccompanied tour.  In most cases, you won't go with him, thus the unaccompanied.  That's a PCS for him though.  He can also go to Japan, Germany, Italy or other locations overseas that you will be able to move with him as a PCS.

Where is the support from his fans when needed. Fickle fans...nasty.\nand no I do not support Brazil, Im a Socceroo all the way.

As well as the appropriate wood for an arrow. ; Hard question to answer, bud.  A simple survival bow is easy enough but I have no idea how much work you want to put into it.\n\nEasiest way to learn?  Find a good sapling approx 3-4"" in diam that's scrub.  Lop it off approx a foot above the ground and cut it so it's approx 6' long.  Lots of really good woods out there and most everyone has their fav....me I just say cut a sapling.\n\nUse a semisharp knife and a hammer and split it right down the middle from the thin end.  Do that again so you have a 1/4 trunk.  That's called a bowstave.\n\nRound off the sharpness on that triangle shape in the exact middle, but keep the triangle shape.  Starting about a foot on either side of the center point, start whittling the triangle flatter and flatter as you move out to the ends.  Always whittle the back, not the front!\n\nKeep experimenting with bending it as you whittle....so if one end bends more than the other, simply whittle a bit more on the other end til it bends approx the same.  That's called ""tillering"".  I won't get into it.\n\nOnce both ends (the limbs) bend in a good solid arc and it feels good to you, carefully notch the ends so they can hold a string.\n\nTie your string on one end and then keep bending the bow and retying the other til the tight string is approx 8"" from the back of the bow.\n\nThat's a really basic survival type bow.  You could spend years mastering each step if you wanted to really make bows, but that one will have you shooting within an hour or two and they're fun to teach the kids as a summer project.\n\nArrows....you can use the same old 1/4 trunks that you cut for the bow.  Each one will make approx four arrows.  Simply split each 1/4 stave like before and just start whittling the corners.  Keep whittling the corners until they're round.\n\nAnything I need to cover in more depth?",2482

9,"What do you think about illegal immigrants? ; Should they be allowed and tolerated, or should we start cracking the whip? ; You know there are probably a lot of terrorists arleady here.  What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice. I say WAKE UP, take responsibility for your actions, and GET LEGAL or leave.",2551

As you can imagine, there are a lot of potential water contaminants that could occur in the pipes between the plant and the last house on the line.

1,"why do some people have slight humps at the top of their spines on the splenius capitis area? ; I am covering human anatomy to qualify as holistic therapist and need to know this answer ; That is a condition known as kyphosis, or Scheuermann’s disease.  This condition occurs when the front of the upper spine does not grow as fast as the back of the spine, so that the vertebrae become wedge-shaped, with the narrow part of the wedge in front. The wedge-shape of the vertebrae creates an increase in the amount of normal kyphosis (front angulation of the thoracic spine). \n\nThe wedging of vertebrae in Scheuermann’s kyphosis is most common in the thoracic spine (upper back), with the apex of the curve typically between the T7 and T9 levels of the spine. Although less common, Scheuermann’s kyphosis may also occur in the junction between the thoracic and lumbar spine (thoracolumbar spine) or in the lumbar spine (lower back). \n\nThe cause of Scheuermann's disease is unknown, but is thought to be due to a growth abnormality of the vertebral body. The growth plate anteriorly (in the front) stops growing but the posterior part of the growth plate continues to grow. This is due to a condition known as osteochondrosis. \n\nScheuermann’s disease does not spread and is not really a “disease” but a condition that can arise during growth. It is more common in males and appears in adolescents usually towards the end of their growth spurt, but can occur in anyone.\n\nIf the roundback deformity is severe, patients are more likely to have discomfort or pain along with the deformity as they age. \n\nLearn more about it at the website below.

I might get one of them. ; Dental implants vary tremendously in cost depending upon how many you will need.  Some of the answers here are wrong - very wrong.  A dental implant is better for your jaw bone and your own dental health because once the implant is properly seated in the bone it will stimulate your bone to grow just as your normal teeth stimulate the bone to grow.  \n\nI would guess you have seen little old men and or ladies who have almost now lower jaw and no teeth.  The jaw actual stopped growing new bone tissue because of the lack of stimulation for having teeth anchored to the jaw bone. \n\nHere is how they should work. You should have  a CAT scan done of your upper and lower jaw.  Depending upon where the implant is to be placed.  The dentist may want to make a surgical guide that will allow him to drill at the exact angle that is needed to the base of the implant is screwed into the correct type of bone.  This is critical because there are different  types of bone density in your jaw and you want your implant seated in the bone with the greatest density.  Once the implant is placed in your jaw bone he may or may not depending upon the opinion of the dentist  attache the final prosthetic onto the implant.  The prosthetic is what looks like a normal tooth.  Bingo - you are done. \n\nSummary Cost is variable, they do not hurt when inserted.

Start with 15 reps,  take a break for a few seconds do 14, take a break for a few seconds and do 13.  Continue until you get to 0.  If you feel up to it then start at 1 and go back up the to 15.\n\nPUSH UPS FOR SPEED.  Do as many good push ups as you can do in 2 minutes.

Everyone who is mad at him needs to realize THEY aren't perfect either! Yinz are pissin me off!!! The only thing we should be worrying about is that Ben gets better so he can go on living a long happy life.\nGO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!! ; Most of the people who are calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet have been calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet for a year now. Ever since it became well known that he does it without wearing a helmet people have been saying he was an idiot for it. They aren't calling him an idiot as a general thing, it is calling him an idiot for making a stupid decision. Yes he is 100% within the law. That doesn't mean people don't think the law is stupid. Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head. Remember depending on the helmet they don't really go down enough to prevent a jaw from being broken.\n\nTo old school Yinz is Pittsburghese although most use yunz.\nAs to the one who commented about it being against his contract, sorry but you are mistaken.

I got an overall grade of 89% and she didin't gave me a A. I mailed her twice begging to give me a A beacause I studied hard for it. But she didn't even care. She mailed me back saying that I have to catch a flight ? what kind of responsbility they have? seems like they don't care about our hard work. ; Let's start with the basics: 4 out of 4 A, 3.7 out of 4 A-, 3.3 out of 4 B+, 3 of 4 is a B. For 92.5% and above is at least an A-. I assume you new this before you took the class. 89% is 3.56 well below 3.7. Bordering B+/A-, no where near an A. Begging is not a way of getting a A.\n\nNow let look at the facts: you took a class, did some graded work, and then got evaluated for the work. What that says is that at a given point in time, you got some measurement. That is all. It is not life, it is a temporal measure.\n\nSometimes we win and sometimes we lose. I remember having a 98% and got a B+. It is one of the few grades that I remember, and probably one the few grades that I would like to forget.

Grading criteria is govern by our teachers not our students.\n\nAs unfair as it sounds, hard work is not a factor, it is comprehension. Grades are temporal measures of comprehension. You may have worked hard to comprehend, but hard work is not the measure.\n\nWhatever your grade, it is what you understand that counts.

6,"2 dollars bills? ; how come the u.s. is not making any more 2 dollars note??? ; In spite of its relatively low value, the two-dollar bill is one of the most rarely seen denominations of U.S. currency. This is partly due to the low production of the note; approximately 1% of all notes produced today are $2 bills. Two-dollar bills, unlike other denominations, are not frequently reissued in a new series. This is because bills are printed according to demand. When the Federal Reserve Banking System runs low on its current supply of $2 bills, it will submit an order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which will then print more. Demand for $2 bills is low enough that one printing can last for many years. There is still a large supply of series 1976 bills that have not been circulated.\n\nIt is still a common perception that the $2 bill is rare, and when the general public encounters them, the bills are frequently hoarded and not circulated. According to the Treasury, they ""receive many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation."" [1]. In response, the Treasury states: ""The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations. According to BEP statistics, 590,720,000 Series 1976 $2 bills were printed and as of February 28, 1999, there was $1,166,091,458 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.""",2693
2,"Are rowing machines considered cardio or resistance? ; I've been wondering this for awhile.  On one hand you're constantly moving and it's not THAT hard, like a cardio exercise, but on the other hand you push off with your legs & pull the handle with your arms (which puts off quite a bit of resistance!)  So is a rowing machine considered cardio, resistance, or a happy medium of both? ; Both!\nAny activity that challenges your muscles at loads greater than they are accustomed to via concentric and eccentric contraction is considered resistance exercise.  The duration of the movement and energy system being used then classifies the exercise as cardiovascular or otherwise.\n\nFor example if you were to row as quickly as possible for 10 seconds or less you would primarily use the phosphagen/creatine system which provides ATP immediately to the muscle, so the energy needs are fast and powerful.\n\nIf you were to then continue rowing for 20s to 90s you would involve the glycolytic system (glucose/lactic acid) and anaerobic contributions of to ATP delivery would increase.\n\nIt's not until about 2+ min that you require a much greater oxygen utilization which would kick-in the aerobic system hence a full cardiovascular workout.\n\nSo it really does depend on how long you decide to row.  Since most people row for extends periods, it's usually classified as a cardiovascular exercise although the argument to oppose it would have to fall under the above guidelines.",2694

I do bars once a week, and my hands stay sore all week. It's not severe enough to go to a doctor, but something needs to be done to it! I purchased grips (leather things you put on your hands to help you slide) but they are too big right now. I use chalk, but it doesn't work very well. Any remedys? Water soaking strategies? HELP!!!! Anything! ; First, when not in the gym, keep your hands clean.  Calisuses that split open can become infected.  My hands were rough and calused from rowing each morning along the river.  The wooden oar would pull and pull.  In college, the horse and bar both pulled at my hands at the base of my fingers.  As a rock climber, my hands become scraped now and then.  Avoiding infection is top priority because it will stop your routine dramatically.\n \n Second, you develop a calus because of friction that is ""cooking"" your skin into a tougher, flat pad.  This friction is almost unavoidable, because it's also what gives you grip.  A bit more chalk may allow for some slip, but of couse don't lose your grip.\n\n That said, you may simply need to give your hands some time to heal.  Like a pair of shoes, your skin will adjust to the wear they encounter.  If you want to see the most incredible example of this, ask a commercial sailor/fisherman.  Their hands are like gnarled rocks.  If possible, just wait an extra day and do a workout that doesn't involve hands.  When not on the bar, I went diving or did floor routines.  It's not the same, but it'll give you a nice workout while you wait.",2702

I was out on a pontoon boat on a local lake that I had fished for ages.  Loads of people go out there for a fireworks show at night, but being the avid fisherman I am, I took along a few rods and a couple tackle boxes.  \n\nWhile we were out there, a few of the people I was with started asking me questions about that particular lake.  One other kid who I knew didn't fish at all and didn't know diddly squat about fishing started answering everything.  He's your stereotypical frat boy and no offense to anyone out there, but he was fishing w/ a zebco 33.  Well after a while, I realized that he answered every question w/ ""Well the only real lure on this lake is a spinnerbait.  It's the only one that works anyways.""\n\nSo I waited until he said it a few more times, and then I said loud enough for everyone to hear me, ""You fish with that spinnerbait, and I'll use a plastic worm and we'll see what happens.""\n\nThis is where it gets good...\n\nFirst cast, I flipped a black trick worm about 3 feet behind an underwater tree that had reached the surface.  I pulled it a few times kinda jerkin' it, and in the next second, BAM!  I hooked up to a 4 pounder.  In about the next hour, I had landed about 25 pounds worth of bass in 5 fish.  \n\nI've fished plenty of tournaments, and I would have killed to have been in one that day, but as they say, ______ happens.\n\nMeanwhile, spinnerbait boy is over there in the corner w/ no bites at all.  By this time the people have tuned him out when he starts talking, and I'm loving it.  Then he casts and says he had a bite.  ""I missed it, I'll get him again.""\n\nThree or four more times, the bite is in the same place, and he keeps missing it.  (I'm starting to think it's a log, weeds, rock, etc. but I didn't say anything)  On the next cast, he got to the spot where he had been getting a ""bite"" and set the hook violently.  He fought and fought and fought and said he had a big one.  ""Get the camera, this one is going to be a good one""  <== Exact words.  \n\nWell when the monster surfaced, it was about a 4 ft. stick.  Everyone kept giving him crap about it and eventually he just sat back and shut up.  From that point on, every question from anyone on the boat was directed towards me!",2719
4,"AutoCAD explanation please? ; Can someone explain this to me?  This is what an assignment for autoCAD states:\n\nOpen the drawing called XX and save it with a name of your choice.  Construct the table as shown, using the provided dimensions.  All pieces have been inserted at 0, 0, 0 and are flat on the floor in the world coordinate system.  Hint:  You will need to change the user-coordinate system to rotate and copy some of the pieces.  Tilemode to paperspace and present this table in two mviews at no particular scale.  Show the table in isometric and plan views.  There is no need to dimension this drawing. \n\nI just need to know how to do it in laymans (sp?) terms for autoCAD 2006 or 2007.\n\nThanks in advance. ; I'm guessing when it says all the pieces have to be inserted at 0,0,0 the pieces it refers to are pre drawn blocks (parts of the table will be drawn separately and saved as separate drawings). To do this you go to insert - blocks, then browse for the particular pre drawn block. \nTilemode to paper space is the command line way of jumping from the model tab to the layout tab at the bottom of the drawing area. You can do this by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the drawing like an excel worksheet.\nThe two mviews piece refer to creating viewports in the layout tab so you can see the model your have drawn...to do this make sure you are in the layout tab and click on View - Viewports - 2 viewports, two windows will now appear in the drawing with the same view of the table. \nAssuming the table was drawn correctly double click the area within the first view port and the click on View - 3d Views - Top, this will give you the plan view of the table, adjust the scale to suit. Then double click within the second viewport and the go to View - 3d Views - Isometric (there are 4 to chose from) this will give you your isometric view. Again adjust the scale to suit. Click outside both the view ports to return to the layout space\n\nI hope this helps, if you need any further assistance please feel free to email me.",2720

0,"Is Bernard Lonergan more influened by his Louvain heritage than by Aquinas historically understood? ; That is to say, the Louvain tradition was commissioned by Leo XIII to answer the challenges of skepticism a la Kant. Lonergan's magnum opus ""Insight"" turns out in the end to be an argument for the existence of God. In light of Victor Preller's work on Aquinas (which argues that Aquinas's Five Proofs were not meant to prove God's existence but to show the insufficiency of such proofs), should Lonergan be understood to be proving the existence of God as a response to Cartesian and Kantian epistemologies and not (goes the implication) by faithful extension of Aquinas historically understood? ; I've only been through ""Insight"" once, and read the ""Verbum"" articles years ago, so somebody might have a more detailed answer. \n\nLonergan does seem to have a Kantian agenda, though he doesn't directly engage Kant. The Kantian question is: by what right do we make metaphysical statements, such as ""God exists."" Lonergan argues by describing the process by which we makes true statements, though not in the same manner as Kant. His approach is more empirically oriented, looking at everyday experiencing and judging (whereas Kant was interested in the validity of those judgments necessary for Newtonian physics). From this basis, he argues that metaphysical judgments are possible; thus we can give an argument that God exists. \n\nIs this a faithful extension of Aquinas? Leaving aside whether or not Aquinas was interested in proving the existence of God in the modern sense, I would say yes. In fact, much of ""Insight"" sounds to me like a standard neo-scholastic epistemology manual. It's questionable whether his ""turn to the subject"" is a move Aquinas would have made, but I don't see that there's a contradiction between being a response to modern concerns and being a faithful extension of Aquinas.",2734

The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state.

You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive.

The original ""gridirons"" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a ""gridiron,"" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of ""gridiron"" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.",2786

Approximately half the cases of TSS reported today are associated with tampon use during menstruation, usually in young women, though TSS also occurs in children, men, and non-menstruating women.

Melting Pot vs. Salad Bowl. Here discuss that modern day sociologists no longer use the ""Melting Pot"" to describe America. We use the Salad Bowl.

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",2798

Sounded like the teacher had a joke in mind, so here is the answer. It is very long. I have included a source so it is properly academic. \n------------------------------\nHow To Put An Elephant Into A Refrigerator\nAnalysis:\n1) Differentiate it and put into the refrig. Then integrate it in the refrig.\n2) Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).\n3) Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.\n\nNumber theory:\n1) First factorize, second multiply.\n2) Use induction. You can always squeeze a bit more in.\n\nAlgebra:\n1) Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig. Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.\n2) Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.\n\nTopology:\n1) Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.\n2) Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.\n3) The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.\n4) The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.\n5) The property of being inside the referigerator is hereditary. So, take the elephant's mother, cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.\n6) For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals. Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.\n\nAlgebraic topology:\nReplace the interior of the refrigerator by its universal cover, R^3.\n\nLinear algebra:\n1) Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.\n2) Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator. By linearity, x% will fit for any x.\n\nAffine geometry:\nThere is an affine transformation putting the elephant into the refrigerator.\n\nSet theory:\n1) It's very easy! refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the refrigerator both have cardinality c.\n\nGeometry:\nDeclare the following:\nAxiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.\n\nComplex analysis:\nPut the refrig. at the origin and the elephant outside the unit circle. Then get the image under the inversion.\n\nNumerical analysis:\n1) Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term.\n2) Work it out using the Pentium.\n\nStatistics:\n1) bright statistician. Put its tail as a sample and say ""Done.""\n2) dull statistician. Repeat the experiment pushing the elephant to the refrig.\n3) Our NEW study shows that you CAN'T put the elephant in the refrigerator.\n\nTo place a lion into the same refrigerator. Open the refrigerator door take out the elephant and put the lion in.",2806

There was nothing I wouldn't do for her (within reason), and she did stuff for me, just not as much. She invited me to hang out with her and do stuff all the time, and she was a good best friend. I found out that she had been poisoning others against me behind my back, she was never fond of me to begin with, was annoyed when I called her my best friend, and she was using me. I'd like to forgive her, but I don't know how to forgive treachery.\n\nThe other demon is my dad's g/f. She is THE MOST SELFISH person I have EVER met! She expects things to be done all for her or her way, and never lets my dad or ANYBODY else have their say. She doesn't do anything for herself, her daddy does everything for her and lives across the street from her, she's VERY wasteful, and... ; I don't know if you're a religious person, but since your question is about forgiveness, I'll answer it from a Christian perspective; but please understand that you don't have to be religious in order to benefit from the wisdom of the Bible.  I do not consider myself to be Christian, but I still use many things I read in the Bible to help me through challenges of the spirit such as the one you have describe.\n\nFirst of all, we should ALWAYS forgive others.  Jesus said to forgive people seventy times seven times, which comes out to be 490 times.  If you have to forgive someone more times than that, they are probably so evil that it's not going to matter whether you forgive them or not; at that point your best best would bwe to just get the hell away from them!  LOL\n\nBut I think what he meant was to forgive as much as you possibly can.  But you sound very young to me- it sounds like there's not a whole lot you can do OTHER than forgive; sadly, we are basically powerless in our youth to change the behavior of others, so you'd better forgive wholeheartedly and do it RIGHT.  The following information is lengthy, but it will help you learn all you need to know about forgiveneness:\n\n- This is not an optional action on our part, but rather it is imperative to our own well being that we forgive others.\n- Most Christians understand that this is not always an easy task.\n- For some, there have been people in their lives which have wronged them severly.\n\n- Though it may be a process, and it may not happen instantaneously, we must be willing to take the first steps toward forgiving others.\n- As long as we continue to harbor bitterness in our hearts toward someone else, we allow that individual to have a controlling factor in our lives.\n- There are a number of occasions where unforgiving Christians lose their relationship with God because of what someone else had done to them in the church.\n\n- There was once a man who lost his relationship not only with God, but also his children and people in the church because of his bitterness toward others. He basically went around feeling sorry for himself all the time.\n- To forgive means to ""send away"". In other words, to not hang on to the wrong doing.\n\n- When you forgive someone, it means that you are not holding that sin against that person.\n- Therefore, you're not focused on how you can get back at that person.\n- You're not praying that their boat will sink or that their plane will crash.\n- As a matter of fact, you actually begin to pray for their salvation and deliverance.\n\n- Understand that when you forgive someone, it doesn't mean that you have to re-establish a relationship with that person.\n- It may, by God's will, lead to that and that's great if that's what God desires.\n- In the verse, there's no mention that you should stop praying and go find that person to let them know that you forgive them.\n- Release the thought of anger and bitterness and hurt unto God.\n\n- Forgiveness does not mean, by the way, to forget.\n- Trying to forget is merely an attempt to hide something.\n- When you hide something, someone will eventually find it.\n- We're are to deal with he hurt and send it away.\n\n- Jesus didn't just preach this. He lived this.\n\n(Luke 23:33-34 NKJV) And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots.\n\nFORGIVING OTHERS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND AND RECEIVE FORGIVENESS\n\n(Mat 6:14-15 NKJV) ""For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.""\n\n- It seems as if God's ability to forgive us is contingent upon our ability to forgi",2837

Transient paresthesia is usually caused by inadvertent pressure on a superficial nerve, such as sitting in a position for an extended period of time, and disappears gradually as the pressure is relieved. Other kinds of paresthesia, however, can be chronic and painful, and can come from a wide variety of sources.\n\nChronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of nerve cells, or neurons. This malfunction, which is especially common in older individuals, is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs, or may be caused by atherosclerosis—the build up of plaque on artery walls. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. Because of this, paresthesia is also a symptom of vitamin deficiency and malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism.\n\nIrritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the surrounding tissue. Joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome are common sources of paresthesia.\n\nAnother cause of paresthesia, however, may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, or neuropathy, which can stem from injury or infection, or which may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a transient ischemic attack, a brain tumor, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.\n\nParesthesiae of the mouth, hands and feet are common, transient symptoms of the related conditions of hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks.\n\nOther known causes of paresthesia:\n\nAlcoholism \nAnticonvulsant drugs such as topiramate, sulthiame, and acetazolamide \nDehydration \nHeavy metals \nMigraines \nRadiation poisoning",2843

(Ancient child custody issues.)  The girl drowned, but the boy was ""hospitably received"" by Aetes, King of Colchis.  The boy then sacrificed the ram to Jupiter and gave the golden fleece to his host.  He placed it in a consecrated grove with a dragon to guard it.  Eventually, Jason's uncle, who was supposed to surrender the throne of his kingdom when he reached maturity, sent him on a wild goose chase, er golden fleece quest, claiming the fleece was the rightful property of their kingdom.  Which it was not.  Anyway, Jason rounded up a tough bunch of friends of his, and off they went looking for the fleece.\n\nFrom this point on, you can substitute what you know of grail quests, for the symbols and traditions have been intermingled for centuries.

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.  Have faith that what you really need will be available to you when the need actually arrives.  Never lose hope...it is stronger than experience.  Live life!!!",2871

Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.

9,"Why did Democrats choose the donkey for their mascot? ; Donkeys are asses and Elephants never forget. ; When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, his opponents tried to label him a ""jackass"" for his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson, however, picked up on their name calling and turned it to his own advantage by using the donkey on his campaign posters. During his presidency, the donkey was used to represent Jackson's stubbornness when he vetoed re-chartering the National Bank.\n\nThe first time the donkey was used in a political cartoon to represent the Democratic party, it was again in conjunction with Jackson. Although in 1837 Jackson was retired, he still thought of himself as the Party's leader and was shown trying to get the donkey to go where he wanted it to go. The cartoon was titled ""A Modern Baalim and his Ass"".\n\nInterestingly enough, the person credited with getting the donkey widely accepted as the Democratic party's symbol probably had no knowledge of the prior associations. Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist, came to the United States with his parents in 1840 when he was six. He first used the donkey in an 1870 Harper's Weekly cartoon to represent the ""Copperhead Press"" kicking a dead lion, symbolizing Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had recently died. Nast intended the donkey to represent an anti-war faction with whom he disagreed , but the symbol caught the public's fancy and the cartoonist continued using it to indicate some Democratic editors and newspapers.\n\nLater, Nast used the donkey to portray what he called ""Caesarism"" showing the alleged Democratic uneasiness over a possible third term for Ulysses S. Grant. In conjunction with this issue, Nast helped associate the elephant with the Republican party. Although the elephant had been connected with the Republican party in cartoons that appeared in 1860 and 1872, it was Nast's cartoon in 1874 published by Harper's Weekly that made the pachyderm stick as the Republican's symbol. A cartoon titled ""The Third Term Panic,"" showed animals representing various issues running away from a donkey wearing a lion's skin tagged ""Caesarism."" The elephant labeled ""The Republican Vote,"" was about to run into a pit containing inflation, chaos, repudiation, etc..\n\nBy 1880 the donkey was well established as a mascot for the Democratic party. A cartoon about the Garfield-Hancock campaign in the New York Daily Graphic showed the Democratic candidate mounted on a donkey, leading a procession of crusaders.\n\nOver the years, the donkey and the elephant have become the accepted symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. Although the Democrats have never officially adopted the donkey as a party symbol, we have used various donkey designs on publications over the years. The Republicans have actually adopted the elephant as their official symbol and use their design widely.\n\nThe Democrats think of the elephant as bungling, stupid, pompous and conservative -- but the Republicans think it is dignified, strong and intelligent. On the other hand, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn, silly and ridiculous -- but the Democrats claim it is humble, homely, smart, courageous and loveable.\n\nAdlai Stevenson provided one of the most clever descriptions of the Republican's symbol when he said, ""The elephant has a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by grasping the tail of its predecessor.""",2931

And why won’t they stop?\n\nThe first thing you must understand about addiction is that alcohol and addictive drugs are basically painkillers.  They chemically kill physical or emotional pain and alter the mind’s perception of reality.  They make people numb.\n\nFor drugs to be attractive to a person there must first be some underlying unhappiness, sense of hopelessness, or physical pain.",2951

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

Does anyone know what I can do? ; Yes.If they've gone to collections or an attorney then they're on your report(s) and marked key derogatory or 30,60,90,120 days late.Sometimes the creditor will sell these written off accounts to resurgent companies.At that point you should contact the resurgent company and dispute with all three bureaus.\nOnce you dispute an account that's sold or written off the creditor has no claim to it anymore and will not reply to the dispute.Then the bureaus will remove the information.I did this very same thing and am paying Capital Management only 2477.00 back on 7079.00.They buy these accounts for just a few cents on the dollar and don't report to the bureaus.Resurgent companies don't want your credit ruined.\nBankruptcy is the very last resort.It screws up your credit almost as badly,and yes these bankruptcies go on your reports.\nBarring any of this contact an agency(like the ones you see commercials for) and they can help reduce your payments.I have to do this with my evil ex-wife because I unknowingly married into 27,000.00 of credit card debt.I think we used Credit Guard but I try to think of that experience as little as my failed marriage",3005

They should point you in the right direction regarding financing options. Because your parents ""make too much money"" as is the case with the majority of college students, you will probably need to take out student loans. If you go through the U.S. Department of Education's Direct Loan program, the interest rates are extremely reasonable and payback schedules are flexible. \n\nBesides loans, you can also attain non-need-based grants, and scholarships through private institutions. Then, there are also work study programs. Although, admittedly, many of my friends did not like this option. \n\nPlease heed the deadlines for applications submissions as they are extremely important. Be open with your financial aid officers and let them know your concerns and they should give you some good advice.\n\nGood luck!",3103

5,"Why do they bid to negotiate Japanese pitcher's? ; I don't understand why they have to negotiate to talk to Japanese pitcher's? who gets that money the player? We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

6,"what are the advantages and disadvantages of finance on a personal basis? ; i need information on if britain is becoming a debt ridden society and have to compare adv and dis ad ; The advantage of taking out a loan is that you keep whatever savings or capital that you may have intact, for other investment purposes. This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard.

He doesn't even contribute to the raising of the kids he had with my sister: he doesn't pay for the kids needs, he leaves everything to my sister. all he does when he's not working is go out partying and getting drunk, obsess about his computer, play hockey or park his butt on the couch and watch hockey or wrestling. And when things go wrong even if its his fault, itssomeone elses fault in his mind.

A rich friend or Strong Friend to Kick his A%% out of there.\nThat said...\n\nYOu didn't say who he threatened.  You?  If so, you really need to get out of there, even if you are not convinced he would cause you harm.  If someone says it, they are capable of acting on it.  You don't need to stay there, and yes if he said he would cause you bodily harm, you can call the authorities and have him charged for assault.  Sadly, the police don't and won't do much for you on this. The laws are set up to protect the guilty.  Without witness it is him agains you.  Remember that.  You are in a no win situation really.\n\nYour sister has made a choice to be with this person.\nYOU NEED TO MOVE OUT...\nWhat you do after that is up to you.(pressing charges for instance)\n\nIf you feel she is in danger , call the police.\nIf you feel her kids are in danger call Child Protective Services. (remember they can make someone's life miserable), so don't do that unless you truly feel the kids are in danger.\n\nIMPORTANTLY this is my opinion, and any ideas given here must be taken as such.  If you want real legal advise, you should consult with an attorney in your area of jusisdiction.\n\nYou don't like this guy, and it sounds like you have a good reason, but you NEED to remember, your sister has made the choice to have him there.  YOU can leave. You don't have to stay there, and even if it is an inconvenience, you move and find a more peaceful place to live.

This is not an easy situation.

I thought that insurance keywords were worth alot, like 3-15 dollars a click? ; Top keywords list that say a keyword costs anywhere from 3-15 dollars is one thing; and the real income received from the publisher is another thing. Google Adsense has what is called ""smart pricing"" which either discounts or jack up the cost to an advertiser depending on how likely a web page will convert for the advertiser. What you are experiencing is a classic case of smart pricing. You've been smartpriced out of what you thought was a high keyword\n\nFrom the Google webpage, here is how they define smart pricing http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/18989.html\n\n""Because contextually targeted ads on our content network sometimes return lower conversion numbers than ads on Google.com search results pages, clicks from the content network use ""smart pricing"" adjustments. Google's smart pricing technology automatically lowers the cost of content clicks based on the referring site, to maximize the return on investment for advertisers. \n\nIf our data shows that clicks from a particular content page are less likely to return results, our system automatically reduces the price the advertiser pays for those clicks. The AdWords system takes the work out of CPC bidding, helping to ensure strong return on investment no matter where your ads appear. Smart pricing adjustments are automatically reflected in the average CPC for content targeting shown in the Campaign Management interface. \n\nAs an example of smart pricing, consider two websites, each related to digital photography. The first page features digital camera reviews, while the second offers photography tips. Clicks from the page of photography tips might be charged less, because they are expected to convert into sales less frequently, resulting in lower value for advertisers. Google data determines that clicks from the digital camera reviews convert better, so clicks from this page are not discounted.""",3162

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

Now push down quickly with your back leg, slamming the tail into the ground, and slide the edge of your front foot up the griptape.

4,"What is object oriented programming? ; I dont know a lot about computer, but I heard my friend talk about object oriented programming.\nWhat is object oriented programming?\nWhat are its major elements?\nIs it an important concept in programming? Why so? ; If you've never used an object-oriented language before, you need to understand the underlying concepts before beginning to write code. You need to know what an object is, what a class is, how objects and classes are related, and how objects communicate by using messages.\n\nObject-oriented programming. Objects of the program interact by sending messages to each other.\n\nWhat Is an Object? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An object is a software bundle of related variables and methods. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects you find in everyday life. \n\nWhat Is a Message? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    Software objects interact and communicate with each other using messages. \n\nWhat Is a Class? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind. \n\nWhat Is Inheritance? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class inherits state and behavior from its superclass. Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring software programs. \n\nWhat Is an Interface? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An interface is a contract in the form of a collection of method and constant declarations. When a class implements an interface, it promises to implement all of the methods declared in that interface. \n\nHow Do These Concepts Translate into Code? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    This section looks at a small applet, and shows you the code that creates objects, implements classes, sends messages, establishes a superclass, and implements an interface.\n\nfor the importance part\n\nObject-oriented programming is claimed to give more flexibility, easing changes to programs, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Furthermore, proponents of OOP claim that OOP is easier to learn for those new to computer programming than previous approaches, and that the OOP approach is often simpler to develop and to maintain, lending itself to more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than other programming methods. Translation from real-world phenomena/objects (and conversely) is eased because there is direct mapping from the real-world to the object-oriented program (generally a many-to-one). The converse mapping, from the object-oriented program back to the real-world, is by way of a one-to-many mapping, where each 'many' is seen to be a collection of well-defined subsets (or superset), which together compose a real-world object. The corresponding object defined in the program may be seen as representing some proper subset of the real-world object's features.",3183

7,"What is the life in the 80s like? ; I was born in 1990 and I never had experiences in the 1980s obviously but I watched many old movies and TV shows dated back in the 80s. Soon, I became very curious and wondered what life is like in the 80s. I visited the 80s nostalgia websites and I became obsessed with them! Sounds fun they were in the 80s. I just wanted to ask one thing... What life is like exactly in the 80s? Fun? Wacky? Regardless of the technology, which do you prefer...today or the 80s? and reason why? I'm even reporting my interests in the 80s in class, too! I hope you share your experiences with me and the other Yahoo users about the 80s. ; dude, i was born to answer this question. i loved the 80s. you really do not realize how much you miss something until it is gone. as with everything, age gives one a perspective. while living inside the decade, i didn't know i really cared. i'm not one to blab on and on, so i'll try keep it short. one of my very first memories is of the miracle on ice. i also remember hearing about john lennon getting shot. the significance of both was lost on me until i was a bit older. flew to LA to see the olympics in'84, the soviets boycotted since the usa did in 1980. Carl Lewis was the man. so was evil kneivel (sp?), that guy had big brass balls! \nwhile in school, the space shuttle Challenger blew up before my very eyes while we were watching the first teacher, christy mccauliffe, lifted into space. There were attempted assassinations of pope john paul II and president reagan.  there was always an air of fear due to nuclear arms and the cold war. the soviets were the enemy, that was that. watch the movie 'red dawn' for a perspective. it blew my mind when the berlin wall fell and so did the soviet union. I knew i was a witness to history, very cool. ronald reagan was the president. and since he was the president during my formative years, and i was taught to respect the office, love or hate the man, he was the example all the others had to live up to. i vaguely remember the iran hostage situation that preceded ronald reagan being elected.  \nmusic wise, my older brother was punk and I loved punk, ramones, dead kennedys and black flag to name a few. i was not a big fan of the electronic music, e.g., flock of seagulls, human league, until i got older and i realized it was a soundtrack to my youth. I was there when MTV started, i saw the first video they aired, video killed the radio star, or whatever. madonna's playboy issue was highly sought after. i used to be abe to run into the store to buy my father cigarettes, and a pack was less than a dollar! so much to talk about, i could go on forever.\ni miss the 80s because of the nostalgia, i was young and innocent and it seemed that the world was too. when you get older, you will miss your past and hopefully be passionate about it as much.",3243

1,"PHYSICS PROBLEM.. can you answer it? ; Bob and Joe, 2 construction workers on the roof of a building, are about to raise up a keg of nails from the ground by means of a rope passing over a pulley 16 m above the ground. Bob has a mass of 100 kg, Joe 80 kg, the keg 40 kg, and the nails 80 kg. Bob and Joe slip off the roof and the following unfortunate sequence of events takes place. \n\nBob and Joe, hanging on the rope together, strike the ground just as the keg hits the pulley. Unnerved by the fall, Bob lets go of the rope, thus the falling keg pulls Joe back up to the roof where he cracks his head against the pulley but gamely hangs on. However, the bottom falls out of the keg of nails when it strikes the ground. The empty keg rises to the top as Joe returns to the ground. Finally, Joe has had enough and lets go of the rope as he remains on the ground, only to be hit by the empty keg. \n\nIgnoring the possible mid-air collisions, how long did it take for this drama to unfold? use -10 for acc. of gravity. ; Hope this helps...\nBreak this question down into four independent events.  1) Bob and Joe falling, 2) Keg with nails falling, 3) Joe falling, 4) Keg falling.\n\nIf you look at one specific event, then you can assume that both sides of the pulley start at rest (since either it starts that way, or some poor guy smacks the ground or the pulley).  Therefore: look for Fnet on the total masses on the rope.  Take for instance, the first episode, where Bob and Joe (Total mass 180kg) is against the keg and nails (120kg).  Since F=ma, then the individual forces on Bob and Joe = 180(10) and the keg and nails 120(10).  So, Fnet would be 180(10)-120(10) for this specific case.  Then, you would look at the total Force, the total mass, and the acceleration of the entire system.  Once you have the acceleration, then you can easily figure out time, since you have a 16m pulley height (you have to assume Bob and Joe are starting at pulley height, otherwise the problem is unsolvable).  Just use the -1/2at^2+Vot+do=D equation, and since there is no Vo, this should be easy.\n\nDo this for each subsequent episode with the varying masses, and that should give you your total time.  Oh, and the rope has to be massless and the pulley frictionless, too.\n\nAnd unless I'm totally missing something, just plug and chug.  Good luck!",3255

9,"Do UN covenants have more effect than a country's own guidelines? ; Just wondering...\n\nI've been looking over their Charter and covenants and ... almost every nation in this world is guilty of ignoring their rules/guidelines.\n\nIs this supposed to happen?\n\nIt just seems like the UN really doesn't... have any effect whatsoever. ; The goal of the United Nations was to increase discussion between nations in an effort to prevent global conflict.  But has it worked or does it really have any jurisdiction over its members, no.  Many nations, such as the United States of America, have failed to ratify much of the UN charter.  For example, the US has not ratified the International Criminal Court, a separate judiciary entity somewhat affiliated with the UN.  However, the UN does play a somewhat integral part in maintaining communication with outside nations. A great example is the UN's efforts to aid with peacekeeping in Darfur.  Though this is seemingly unsuccessful, the UN has worked to maintatin the prescence of peacekeeping troops in the region. \n\nHowever, this leads to more problems.  Throughout the years, peacekeeping troops have been known to rape their refugees and commit other inappropriate acts during their mission. This increases the negative opinion of the UN and its actions among nations.  In addition, when nations such as the US blatantly violate the charter and the UN declarations, it suggests the ignorance of global opinion. These events lead to greater tension between nations instead of increased pacifism, as the body is designed for. \n\nNo nation, due to the act of sovereignty, must abide by the laws of the UN.  This is solely because if the rules of the UN were more heavily imposed than national law, prominent UN nations, the UK, US, France, etc., would have greater precedence in the domestic politics of smaller nations, such as Swaziland.  This would lead to an almost imperialistic setting where global superpowers would be able to enact laws that colonized developing nations and poverished nations.\n\nI hope this answers your question!",3340

1,"Why there is redshift & violetshift if planets move close or away?If wavelength changes then why? ; I understand that the redshift and violetshift is due to change in wave-length. What is my doubt is that why there is change in wavelength. Is it like wave is compressed or stretched? Is is like that, that wave has to accomodate it self between earth and corresponding planet? ; good question....its kind of complicated but basically, one type of Red Shift is similar to the doppler effect for sound. When an ambulance screams towards you the siren gets noticable higher pitched, then when it races away the pitch drops. This is because the sound waves are traveling at a fixed speed  toward your ears, but the fast movement of the ambulance is changing the frequency, or the rate at which those waves hit you. it is essentially smushing more of the sound waves together as it approaches you and stretching them out as it moves away. This same principle applies to light and all electromagnetic waves. \n\nThe other type of red shift include cosmological redshit, and gravitational or (relativistic red shift). \n\nCosmological red shift can occur as space it self expands, this expansion of space expands the actual photons and inturn drops the frequency of the light towards red. \n\nGravitational Red Shift can occur when ever light passed through a gravitational field. Gravity imposses a time dilation effect on anyting in the field and so photons are also subject to this. The result is the drop in frequency towards red. \n\n(it is also important to note that the red shift also applies to all electro magnetic waves visible or not, and in cases where the light would be infra red or already at a lower frequency than red, a red shift would actually shift that wave further away from red.)",3363

We both agree that buying a house is more important to us then getting married right now.  We still want an actual nice wedding ceromony, we don't want to get married at the courthouse just to facilitate buying a house.\nWe are planning on buying a house in Virginia or North Carolina.  Should we concentrate on buying a house or planning a wedding? ; It really depends on what kind of nuptial ceremony you plan on having?  Something informal with low overhead?  Then sure, get married first as that won't crunch the pocket book.  Now if you want a ""Cinderella"" wedding, then WAIT!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely purchase a house first!! Housing prices generally continue to go up, hence, equity in your pocket!! If you are worried about what family will say, who cares?? It's your life and you are only trying to better it!\n\nGood luck :)\n\nP.S......... purchasing a house sans marriage has absolutely NOTHING to do with who gets what should you seperate prior to getting married.  How you take title DOES!!  Should you purchase the home prior to marriage, you would each take title in your individual name, then after each of your names, you would state ""single man"" and ""single woman"" (assuming neither of you has been married before.  If either of you has been married before, then after that person's name it would say, ""unmarried man/woman"".  You would then have to decide that should one of you die before the other whether or not you want to leave your share of the house to the other person OR to someone else.  I'll give you an example of each:\n\nThis would be if both have never been married before AND want to leave the house to the surviving partner:\n\nJonh Doe- single man and Suzie Smith-single woman as joint tenants.\n\nNow if each of you would prefer to leave your half of the house to someone else, this is how you would take title (again, assuming neither of you has been married):\n\nJohn Doe-single man  (list his percentage of ownership) and Suzie Smith-single woman (list her percentage of ownership) with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this case, you would state in a will or trust or even on a notorized piece of paper, ""who"" your percentage of the house goes to. Also, in either example, if one of you has been married you would just change out ""single"" to read ""unmarried"".\n\nmb",3368

He gets great grades and I just can't let it go because it makes school miserable for him. ; If he shows the bullies he doesn't care what they are saying (ignore)...they may stop and pick on someone else. A lot of the bullies keep doing it because they are getting a reaction out of your son.

He chooses to enter the debate of God/gods but ""must"" does not apply.  Belief in nothing is not a belief system, but trying to disprove faith becomes an avocation.\n\nAgnostics would seem to me to be more engaged in a inner dialogue of an existence of a higher power.

The flexibility of friction ridge skin means that no two finger or palm prints are ever exactly alike (never identical in every detail), even two impressions recorded immediately after each other.

That works even if you are not self-published. The best place to learn about the Web part of this is http://inquire-sbi.com\n\nBest wishes.\nhttp://www.writershelper.com",3539

We want a child desperatly but I am not sure if I can handle the pain after sex much longer.

It was extremely painful and I felt nauseous, but after a few hours I was completely fine.  Ruptured cysts almost always heal on their own, but they're painful and have a small chance of infection.  I know you want to have a child, but sometimes birth control pills help with cyst problems (also depends on what kind of cysts you have).  If you can't get your surgery scheduled any sooner, perhaps you should ask about going on the pill just until something else can be done for them.

For a station in Earth orbit something higher than 9 km/s seems reasonable, less for lower inclination orbits.\n\nOnce you've got that you then need the exhaust velocity of your rocket, it would depend on what you are using but you can get some rough values from the first source.\n\nWith that the mass ratio is the exhaust velocity times the natural log (ln key on scientific calculators) of the Δv.\n\nThe mass ratio is the difference between the starting and ending mass of the rocket so the amount of fuel will be the (mass ratio minus one) times the mass of the rocket structure + payload.\n\nYou'll probably get something absurdly large (it's very hard to exceed 10 in the real world) and if so then you've got to use staging which makes it a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Soyuz FG which launches the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to the ISS has about 280 tonnes of propellant at launch over all three stages for a spacecraft lighter than 8 tonnes.  Of course the Soyuz FG uses LOX/Kerosene, more efficient propellants like LOX/H2 would need less propellant for the same payload but it isn't going to be an order of magnitude reduction.",3563

1,"How come when it rains, some times there's thunder and lightening with the rain and sometimes there's not? ; And how come sometimes there's wind with the rain and some times there's not? ; Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth. At the same time, it also is one of the least understood. While lightning is simply a gigantic spark of static electricity (the same kind of electricity that sometimes shocks you when you touch a doorknob), scientists do not have a complete grasp on how it works, or how it interacts with solar flares impacting the upper atmosphere or the earth's electromagnetic field.\nLightning has been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes. However, it is most often seen in thunderstorms.At any given moment, there can be as many as 2,000 thunderstorms occurring across the globe. This translates to more than 14.5 MILLION storms each year. NASA satellite research indicated these storms produce lightning flashes about 40 times a second worldwide.This is a change from the commonly accepted value of 100 flashes per second which was an estimate from 1925. Whether it is 40, 100, or somewhere in between, we live on an electrified planet.\n\nThe Sound of Thunder\nRegardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000°F (30,000°C), a temperature that is five times the surface of the sun! When lightning occurs, it heats the air surrounding its channel to that same incredible temperature in a fraction of a second.\n\nLike all gases, when air molecules are heated, they expand. The faster they are heated, the faster their rate of expansion. But when air is heated to 54,000°F in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon known as ""explosive expansion"" occurs. This is where air expands so rapidly that it compresses the air in front of it, forming a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. Exploding fireworks produce a similar result.\n\nWhat is the difference between a thundershower and a thunderstorm?  \nTechnically, there is none. In general, the term ""thundershower"" tends to denote a fairly weak storm with light to moderate rainfall and low levels of lightning activity. However, there are no defined parameters that distinguish between a thundershower and a thunderstorm. In fact, in order to avoid confusion, we in the National Weather Service do not use the term ""thundershower"". If a shower is strong enough to produce lightning, even just one single bolt, it's called a thunderstorm.\n\nTo Learn More about Lightning and Thunder go to \nhttp://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_intro.htm\n\nLIGHTNING SAFETY A MUST READ\nLightning is the MOST UNDERRATED weather hazard. On average, only floods kill more people. Lightning makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts.\n\nIn the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes COMBINED. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nLightning is one of the most capricious and unpredictable characteristics of a thunderstorm. Because of this, no one can guarantee an individual or group absolute protection from lightning. However, knowing and following proven lightning safety guidelines can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death. Remember, YOU are ultimately responsible for your personal safety, and should take appropriate action when threatened by lightning.\n\nWhile no place is 100% safe from lightning, some places are much safer than others.\nWhere to Go Where NOT to Go \nThe safest location during a thunderstorm is inside a large enclosed structure with plumbing and electrical wiring. These include shopping centers, schools, office buildings, and private residences.\n\nIf lightning st",3565

You can also drink 1/4 tsp of salt in a large glass of water to increase sodium.\n\nAlso, I would strongly advise you to stay away from Gatorade for I do not recommend the use of Gatorade or similar products.

Most clippers occur in winter, but can occur outside of the season; generally, off-season clippers would occur in November\nAlberta clippers take their name from the Canadian province of Alberta. This is where they appear to descend from, especially if one is looking at a U.S. weather map, which frequently chops off the nation of Canada. These are storms which traveled over the Pacific Ocean on the jet stream, but lost a good deal of their moisture through the process of orographic lift as they come into contact with the mountains of the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. The storms arrive over the Canadian plains with little moisture, and become entangled with the cold air mass almost always occupying that region at the time. They then slide southward as they get caught up in the flow around the high pressure system which always inhabits cold polar areas, sending them barreling into the United States\nWhether the storm is crossing Canadian territory or that of the United States, the effect is largely the same. The storms sweep in at high speed over whatever land they encounter, usually bringing with them sharp cold fronts and drastically lower temperatures. It is not uncommon for an Alberta clipper to cause temperatures to drop by 30°F (16°C) in as little as 10 to 12 hours. Also, the storms almost always bring biting winds with them, only increasing the effect of the newly lower temperatures. Winds in advance and during an Alberta clipper are frequently as high as 35 to 45 mph (56 to 72 km/h). As if this were not enough, Alberta clippers also tend to bring snow with them, although since the temperatures are lower the snowflakes are smaller and therefore accumulations are less. A typical Alberta Clipper will leave approximately 2 inches (51.2mm) of snow in its wake, but exceptionally powerful ones or those acting with help from other meteorological sources, i.e., the Gulf of Mexico, can produce up to 8 inches (200 mm) of snow. Alberta clippers crossing the Great Lakes, particularly in the early winter when the water is still warm, can create lake effect snow, adding greatly to the total inherent in the system.\n\nIn winter, Alberta clippers can occur somewhat frequently, two occurring in the same week for several weeks at a time would not be considered unusual",3691
4,"ok, my speakers are on and working...Why can't I listen to windows media player? ; My brother in law said it's my sound drivers. But, I can listen to other players. If it were the sound drivers, wouldn't that be impossible? I also can't listen to my Creative ZenMicro (mp3) player on the computer. Can someone tell me what I can do? I already tried unistalling and re-installing WMP. Also, when I try to play Sims 2 I can't hear the background sounds. HELP! Please! ; Step 1: Checking volume and mute settings:\n\nThe volume setting for one or more sound devices might be disabled or set too low. Use the following steps to adjust volumes to their correct levels:\n\nIn Windows XP, click Start, and then click Control Panel.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel \nIn Windows XP, open Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices, and then click Sound and Audio Devices.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, open Sounds and Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab. \nIn Windows XP, click the Advanced button under Device Volume.\nIn Windows 98 and Me, click the Volume button under Sound Playback. \nRemove all checkmarks from Mute boxes at the bottom of the Master Volume window and adjust the volume setting slide bars to their highest positions. Close the Master Volume window and test for sound. If there is still no sound, go to the next Step. \n\nStep 2: Verifying the connections:\n\nUse the following steps to verify that the sound cables are properly connected from the speaker to the computer (cable connectors and plug assignments are normally color-coded to aid with connections).\n\nUnplug the sound cable. \nPlug headphones or one speaker directly into the speaker out connector on the back of the computer. The speaker out connector may have a symbol of a speaker \nor a circle with an arrow pointing out, or it may just say ""OUT"" next to it. Test for sound using the computer. If sound does not work, go to ""Step 3: \n\nIf sound is restored when the headphones or one speaker is plugged in, replace the original sound cable with a new sound cable and test for sound. Sound should be restored after replacing the sound cable. If sound does not come back after replacing the cable, the sound card needs to be replaced because the speaker out connector is bad.\n\nStep 3: Configuring on-board sound in the BIOS:\n\nSome computers come with sound on the motherboard (on-board), and some computers use a sound card. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS has to be set according to your particular sound configuration. Perform the following steps to correctly configure the sound in the BIOS:\n\nLook at the back of your computer and use one of the following three items to determine the proper sound configuration and sound setting: \nIf the plugs for the speakers and microphones are located next to the parallel, serial, or USB ports, then the computer has on-board sound. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS should be Enabled. If the plugs for the speakers and microphone are located away from the other ports and sit in an area by themselves, the computer has a soundcard. The on-board sound setting (if there is one) in the BIOS should be Disabled. If the computer has sound plugs in both locations, a \nsoundcard has been added to the computer that already contains on-board sound. The on-board sound setting should be Disabled. To enter the BIOS, turn on the computer and when the first screen appears, press the F1 key repeatedly until the BIOS Setup screen opens. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to select the Advanced tab. Press the DOWN ARROW key to select Onboard Audio Options and press ENTER. If Onboard Audio Options is not available, select I/O Device Configuration and press ENTER. If Audio Codec is listed, select it and press ENTER. Select either Enabled or Disabled depending on your \nconfiguration and press ENTER. Press the F10 key and then press ENTER to save and exit Start Windows and check for sound. If there is still no sound, continue to the next Step.\n\nStep 4: Restoring the sound drivers\n\nUse the recovery process to restore individual drivers for a sound or combination sound-modem card. \n\nIf the computer came with recovery discs (Windows 98 and Me), place the last disc of the set into the top disc drive and follow the on-screen menus as they appear. Restart the computer after restoring the sound driver software and test for sound.\nIf there is still no sound, continue to ",3694

8,"weed any one know bout it? ; how long does the affects of pot usualey last after u smoke it.. ; Q: How long does marijuana stay in the user's body?\nA: THC in marijuana is rapidly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs. Generally, traces (metabolites) of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session. However, in chronic heavy users, traces can sometimes be detected for weeks after they have stopped using marijuana.\n\nQ: What happens if you smoke marijuana?\nA: The way the drug affects each person depends on many factors, including:\n- user's previous experience with the drug; \nhow strong the marijuana is (how much THC it has); \n- what the user expects to happen; \n- where the drug is used; \n- how it is taken; and \n- whether the user is drinking alcohol or using other drugs. \nSome people feel nothing at all when they smoke marijuana. Others may feel relaxed or high. Sometimes marijuana makes users feel thirsty and very hungry—an effect called ""the munchies.""\nSome users can undergo bad effects from marijuana. They may suffer sudden feelings of anxiety and have paranoid thoughts. This is more likely to happen when a more potent variety of marijuana is used.\n\nQ: What are the short-term effects of marijuana use?\nA: The short-term effects of marijuana include: \n- problems with memory and learning (11);\n- distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch) (6); \n- trouble with thinking and problemsolving (5); \n- loss of motor coordination; and \n- increased heart rate. \nThese effects are even greater when other drugs are mixed with the marijuana; and users do not always know what drugs are given to them.",3702

You can decide who to play from week to week based on the defenses they are up against.  For instance, this week Kitna is against ATL, who's passing D is statistically not great.  Chances are, DET will have to throw the ball a lot.  I am starting Kitna this week myself.\n\nIf you wanted to get Brees, you'd probably have to trade Dunn or Tiki.  Both are having great years.  I don't think that they'd accept a deal with Marion Barber because he isn't much better (if at all) than their other backs.  So if you dump Dunn or Tiki, then your stuck starting him (assuming that you have to start 2 RBs).  If you only have to start 1 RB, then I would ditch Dunn and Cotchery for Brees.  But if you need 2 RBs, stick with what you got.",3705

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

Good business practices include the following activities:\n\nCareful timing of capital gains and losses; \nUse of conferencing technology to reduce travel costs; and \nPostponement of repair and maintenance activities when faced with unexpected cash flow declines. \n\nOn the other hand, abusive earnings management results from actions such as those cited in the SEC section 704 Report:\n\nImproper revenue recognition; \nImproper expense recognition; and \nUsing reserves to inflate earnings in years with falling revenues. \n\nMagrath and Weld identified six relationships that investors and auditors should consider as early warning signs of abusive earnings management:\n\nCash flows that are not correlated with earnings; \nReceivables that are not correlated with revenues; \nAllowances for uncollectible accounts that are not correlated with receivables; \nReserves that are not correlated with balance sheet items; \nAcquisitions with no apparent business purpose; and \nEarnings that consistently and precisely meet analysts’ expectations",3786

9,"could i be gay..? ; im pretty sure im not gay but everytime i look at naked men i get aroused, i heard that this is normal and it happens to most guys. ; How to tell if you're gay: \n1. If you are over 30 and you have a washboard stomach, you are gay. It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and rather you've been sucking-off the boys and have spent the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah diet. \n\n\n\n2. If you have a cat, you are a Flaaaayming gay. A cat is like a dog, but gay: it grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch except when it uses its nails, and whines to be fed. And just think about how you call a dog...""Killer, come here! I said get your butt over here!"" Now think about how you call a cat... ""Bun-bun, come to daddy, snookums!"" Jeeezus, you're fit to be framed, you're so gay. \n\n\n\n3. If you suck on lolipops, Ring-Pops, baby-pacifiers, or any such nonsense, rest assured, you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks bar-b-q ribs, crab-claws, raw oysters, craw-fish guts, pickled pigs feet, or titties. Anything else and you are in training to suck El Dicko and undeniably gay. \n\n\n\n4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking lot, you're in a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his bathroom, he defecates and urinates where he pleases.\n\n\n5. If you drink decaf coffee with skim milk, you like a high hard one in the poop-chute. Coffe is to be had strong, black (or with thick, wholesome milk) and full-aroma. A vagina-eating man will never be heard ordering a ""Decaf Cafe Latte with Skim"" and he will never, ever know what artificial sweetner tastes like. If you've had Nutrasweet in your mouth, you've had a dick there too. \n\n\n\n6. If you know more than six names of colors or four different types of dessert, you might as well be handing out free passes to your bung. A real man doesn't have memory space in his brain to remember all of that crap as well as all the names of all the players in the Major league, NFL, NBA, college ball, PGA, and Nascar. If you can pick out chartreusse or you know what a ""fresier"" is you're gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than denim, you are faggadocious! \n\n\n\n7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it...you hungry for meat-popsicle. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at a slow driver or to cut the dude off.

I want to truthfully answer your question even though you have attempted to set traps. You see age is not the issue you’re attempting to make it. In some countries the life expectancy of a man is under 45 years of age and in many places in the Bible we find that men in other areas have lived in excess 500 years. Certainly life and coupling practices are different under both circumstances. So while age and culture vary the truth you seek is at what age is a given woman old enough to make life impacting decisions on her own. We see that many cultural differences answer that differently how ever being a man who loved too early and now has daughters prone to make the same bad choices, I have found truth in the area of your interest and it is this. First a child must grow enough to read and write and think deep thoughts a child should then contemplate the great depths a life could travel and the results a life could feel because of choices made. A child should realize that there is a higher power and a help in the living of that life. That child should seek first that powerful assistant and His support. Seeking that first could not possibly cause you to miss the match that would have been known to you as the perfect match. However seeking Him first guarantees that when the time is right He will bring to you the one that is meant for you. A woman should wait until God makes the match so that she doesn’t ruin the perfect union with baggage left over from youthful mistakes and indiscretions based only on the physical urges children. You know in some countries adulthood is not recognized until a person reaches their 30’s Perfection does not play worldly games and does not make sence to mankind.

Then... isn't it a shame that IF Bush could be convicted and sentenced to death -- that there's no way that he could be executed 10 times?  That would be only fitting, after all.\n\n    And... failing any of that, then the next-best thing would be to simply turn Saddam loose with our apologies and reinstate him as President of Iraq.  He then could do that which we've been ABYSMAL at:  reunify that country and re-stabilize it.  Meanwhile, his people would idolize him!  (Too bad it had to cost anywhere between 100,000 and 600,000 innocent Iraqi lives (and those of around 3,000 of our troops) for us to get to this point.) ; Graig C, I don't believe that Saddam is going to be executed. His next trials will drag on for 2 more years until next president will forgive him. Bush only hyped Saddam's execution before the election for political purposes. Bush can't be charged for mass murdering innocent people and thousands of our troops because of the patriotic act he signed. That was indeed shrewed of the neoconservatives. Yes, Saddam was a bad dictator and perhaps deserves to be killed, but he was not the worst dictator. Why is Bush picking on Saddam? USA built him up and made him bad. Rumsfeldt dealt with Saddam and supported him in the past. USA saved Saddam's butt in the past from many assassinations designed by his Shiites rebels. They gave him all the weapons and chemicals to defend himself from those Shiites rebels. Now because Saddam refused to cooperate with the USA like Qaddafi did and because we need Saddam's oil, so he is no good? What about Sudan's President Al-Bashir, who is killing innocent people left and right in Darfur? What about Libya's president, Qaddafi the horrible dictator? What about Egypt's president, Mr. Mubarak, the selfish bad dictator? What about Syria's President, Mr. Al-Assad, who is killing and jailing his opponents every day? What about Saudi Arabia King and his Sheiks, who hate Christians and oppressing outsiders (not Saudis)? Should we invade their countries and execute those dictators as well? C'mon Republicans, Is this logical? It is fine if you want to bully people around and control the oil resources in the world, but this is not the way to do it. Brutal Military Action as we are experiencing, destroying other countries and killing innocent civilians does not match our Great American Values and Morals.

1,"Tell me more about immature stage of termite? ; Scientific reply ; Termites undergo incomplete metamorphosis: \n\ni.e. the eggs hatch into nymphs that are a small copy of the adult specimen. They go thru a development cycle of : \n\n1:Egg > 2:nymph > 3:adult \n\nAs the nymph grows it sheds its exoskeleton (moults), replacing it with a larger one. Moulting occurs 4 - 8 times, and stops when the insect has attained 'adult' size. \n\nThe adults may be wingless workers, wingless soldiers or winged or wingless reproductive adults. Winged reproductive adults are what we commonly see swarming about on rainy summer nights - they are called 'alates'.\n\nTermite development (incomplete metamorphosis) contrasts with the more common insect development we are familiar with (viz. complete metamorphosis) se seen in butterflies. \n\n1: eggs > 2:larva > 3:pupa > 4: adult\n\n---\nYou can learn a bit more about termites here:\nhttp://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2092.html",3858

They served a search warrant in a rough neighborhood and after entering the home and announcing their presence, they were shot at by the woman...who was most likely terrified and confused by the whole thing.  Three of the officers were wounded by the woman and the officers returned fire, which did kill the woman.  It's a horrible situation and there won't be much good to come out of it.  The woman's family is devastated and the officers involved must be feeling conflicted about the whole thing.  The one good thing that might come out of this is that more care will be taken in obtaining no-knock search warrants and raids will be better planned.\n\nIt's a horribly sad situatuion but the term ""murder"" does not appear to apply here becuase there is no information (at this point) that the officers went to the home with the intent of killing this woman.  It was an awful set of circumstances that had one of the worst outcomes imaginable and it is truly pathetic, but it is NOT murder.

The few Asians here (the (offspring of Chinese and Japanese coolie laborers) were confined to Hawaii and the West coast states.

I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922
9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace. Even though the outside world has bestowed upon the boys a sense of morality and order, the danger of savagery remains real even within the context of that seemingly civilized society that has nurtured them.",3923

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

For his comment, he was banned to his castle called Hornberg in Neckarzimmern where he died at the age of 82 in 1562.  I have visited and stayed in every one of his castles in Germany and even saw his iron hand in the Hornberg Castle museum!",4021
6,"do i have a good chance in getting this job?..? ; i dont think i do because i had to reschedule another interview since i was 30 mins late to the first interview i had today, i called explained my situation to the manager that is going to interview me and  i told him i had to make a up test and i lost track of time, they are in desperate need of hiring , so i dont know if i will get the job or if i 'm not since i had to reschedule.. any advice? ; Well it depends, most employers are very picky about interviews and the applicants, this was indeed not a very good first impression.  But of course, you have a mid-term and school is much more important, so you may need to concentrate on that.  \nAs far as the interview is concerned, it's all up to the inteviewer.  If he has a heart, he would excuse you and call you back to reschedule if he was really impressed with your qualifications.  However, that is in a perfect world.    Most likely, you would be scratched from the ""Yes"" pile.   So either or can happen.

I do not yet have a new address for fan mail.  Once one is available, I will post it here immediately.\n\n \n\nBoth the old Nashville P.O. box address for ""Senior Management"" and the Beverly Hills address for ""The Firm"" are no longer good.  And of course, the Dallas addresses found in the Wide Open Spaces liner notes and some old fan club materials have been shut down for years.  Mail sent to any of those addresses will be returned to you.\n\n \n\nWriting to or calling the Chicks or their management is not likely to increase your chances of meeting them.  In fact, they will probably never see it.\n\n \n\nIf you believe that you are the first person to write to them and tell them that you are their “biggest fan,” and that they have changed your life, you are kidding yourself.  They get thousands of fan letters per week, and they all sound alike.  So if you still can’t resist the urge to write to them, at least strive for a little originality.  Unfortunately, they will probably never see it.  But if by some slim chance they do, you are much more likely to be remembered if you have something unique to say.\n\n \n\nThe Dixie Chicks do not answer their fan mail.  They are only human, and they simply do not have time to read or reply to thousands of letters per week.  Not even mail from their “biggest fan.”   But their office personnel will sometimes send photographs to fans that request them.  Your best chance of a reply is if you include a stamped and self-addressed 8x10 envelope with your request.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps you....................................................  :-O",4059

0,"What do you know about Furries or anthropomorphic role players? ; I am just wondering what the general opinions of people on this subject are. By the way, I posted a similar question once and it was removed. I REALLY hope it doesn't happen again. ; An object is ""anthropomorphic"" if it has been given human attributes; these usually include the capacity for rational thought, emotions, and an upright posture. An anthropomorphic animal, therefore is a hybrid that is somewhere between a human and the original species. \n\nExamples of furries abound, and these can surely cement the concept for any readers that stopped to re-read the above paragraphs... Most cartoon characters are furries (e.g. Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Wile E. Coyote, etc.). Many cartoon characters are quite removed from the actual animals; their caracatured forms still retain many animalistic traits, however, and this identifies them as furries. Many comic book characters (e.g. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Omaha the Cat Dancer, Usagi Yojimbo), movie characters (e.g. the Rippers in ""Tank Girl"", Barf in ""Space Balls""), and mascots (e.g. the San Diego Chicken and Smokey the Bear) are also, at a basic level, anthropomorphized animals. Finally, furries are also commonly found in artwork, literature, and mythology (I won't bother to list examples here; I think you've got the idea by now). These are diverse categories, and this is one reason that it is hard to develop a comprehensive notion of what constitutes a ""furry"". \n\nThe diversity of furries is due, in part, to the degree to which they are anthropomorphized. Some characters (such as Mickey Mouse) are modified and humanized to such a degree that they only bear a passing resemblance to the animal from which they were derived. Others, such as Smokey the Bear, still closely resemble an animal in appearance.",4088

0,"Why should we suffer an infinite punishment for finite sins? ; The Bible says ""an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.""  That is the law of justice, where the punishment must equal the crime.  How does eternal hell fit into this vision of justice?  If I spend 1 second gossiping, should I have to suffer a gazillion billion decades of the worst imaginable torture for that?  How is that just?  \n\nJesus is said to have suffered all the torture we deserved.  Yet he only suffered for a finite time.  But supposedly, we deserve an infinite amount of punishment for all the sins we commit.  How is that understandable? ; But your sin isn't finite, because it's a sin against God's holy standard.  He set the way things are to be, if you do something contrary to that, you've sinned against God, not a finite being.  I saw an article that said if you slap a foreign dignitary or someone in authority, that is a worse offense than slapping joe blow down the street.  Both slaps took the same time to commit, but one is a greater transgression.  So it is with God, only God's nature is infinite, so wouldn't that make the sin infinite?  If the sin is infinite, so the punishment must be.  \n\nJesus suffered an finite amount of time, but he was an infinite being (Christians believe Jesus was God).  So his sacrifice was infinite to atone for our sins that were infinite.  I'm not really well versed in the theology of this, but basic Christian teaching is that the only one who could atone for our sins was an infinite being, thats why it's wrong for a Christian to teach that Jesus was not God, but that he atoned for our sins.  Logically, it would be impossible.\n\nIf you want, email me, and I can ask my pastor, he has a Ph.D in philosophy and is a Christian.  I realize you may not agree with what he has to say, but in any case, you could hear a logical answer to your question to better understand what Christians believe.",4118

6,"How do people earn big money making jewelry? ; My sister makes beautiful jewelry, but she only gets $10 - $25 a piece at craft fairs.  I have seen jewelry that looks just like hers in an art gallery asking $l,000 or more. ; First off it all depends on how you market your jewelry. If you want to sell this for $1,000 or more you need to make your customers precieve that kind of value on your product. \n\nFirst if you know that your jewelry is one of a kind you need to show that it does. Your own style and label. Labeling your jewelry is your name to fame. Especially the ones you see in the art galleries. Make your jewelry unique, creative, your style, your design. Make your name as a Brand. Market your name as a Brand. So when people hear your name they know it's your jewelry.\n\nExample: When you say McDonald's...people think of Big Mac\n\nI'm gonna give you a tip that I learned from my father he used to buy old cars and resold the car himself. This is what he used to do to get more money for his car. He used to place flyers in local stores sending customers to my brother's house, to see the car for a high price, which didn't say how much the price of the car this flyer states that we accept any offers. Then in a few days later he place another ad which sent customer's to his house, which this flyer has a lower price on the same car advertise.  So in the end he was selling his car for more, but price was cheaper than from my brother's house. Without Negotiating any pricing on the car.\n\nKnow you can use the same system to resell your jewelry. For example you can set up a website selling it for really high. And you can set up an account on Ebay where your going to sell it for less. Now remember whatever price you sell on your website your going to sell it on Ebay for 1/2 of the price.\n\nYou can also create a blog about jewelry art. And you can talk about your designs. This will increase your Branding.\n\nGood Luck and I hope this will help you in your jewelry business venture.\n\nLuis Galarza,  Business and Telecommunication Consultant\nfor communication tips go to http://www.cogni360blog.co.nr\nand for free business tips go to http://luisgalarza.blogspot.com",4131

5,"i need to know some  stunts? ; I am a coach for a 75lb cheerleading squad and i need to know some stunts for my squad,also how to start a basket toss we need it for the competition ; The above way is one way to do it.  One of our flyers is about 90 pounds, and we figured out an easier way to get more height out of her basket toss.  The two bases each grab their left wrist to make a right angle, and then grab the other bases wrist, to make a square.  The front spot holds underneath the hands, just like in a normal basket toss.  Now, the backspot counts off, 1, 2 - on 2, the backspot puts the flyer in the ""basket"" and the flyer stays their until ready to ""fire"".  Flyer should have their hands on the bases shoulders, elbows out, and shoulders square.  The backspot then grabs the back of the flyers ankles and counts off 1,2 - on two, everyone bounces once, and then throws the flyer in the air.  This gets more height because it allows the flyer to push off better instead of relying on the bases to throw her up in the air right away.\n\nEasy stunts for small girls could include small pyramids or small lifts without a backspot.  Take two bases and a flyer.  Set up one base in a pocket (deep lunge) and another across from her in a prep stance (bent knees, straight back, hands together with palms facing up.)  With both hands on the bases shoulders, the flyer sets one foot in the pocket and bounces into the other bases prep stance.  The base with the prep stance lifts and turns the flyers foot so the the base is now perpendicular with the pocket base and the the flyer now has one foot down in the pocket and one foot up in a prep sideways.  This looks good is you have two of them facing opposite directions.",4167

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

The majority of kids who fit this stereotype generally like to listen to music.  They feel it helps them escape the stresses of reality.  Music has essentially become their anti-drug.  Most kids have jumped into this fad thinking it's cool for guys to wear girl pants and wear black and such, but hey, if they want to express themselves like that, more power to them.

1,"Please tell me what we did wrong with this proof.  The question is:Let a,b and c be integers such that c.....? ; divides a*b. Then either c divides a or c divides b.\nFirst, we tried a bunch of examples, like when c=3 and ab=27, so a =3 and b=9, and you see that c divides a and c divides b.  Or another one is when c=7 and ab=56, so a=7 and b=8, and we know that 7 divides 56 and also 7 divides 7. Also, if c=12 and a=5 and b=24, then ab=120, and you see that c divides 120, and slo c divides b, which is all we need because the conjecture is an ""or"" statement so we only need one of the conditions to be true.  So we decided that the conjecture is true. Proof: Let a,band c be integers. We will prove the conjecture by contrapositive. So we assume that c doesn't divide a and that c doesn't divide b. We will show that c doesn't divide a*b. Since c doesn't dived a, then we know that a doesn't = c*m. Also, c doesn't divide b, so we know that b doesn't = s*n. So ab doesn't = (cm)(cn)=c(cmn). Now, cmn is an integer q(since c,m and n are all integers).Thus ab doesn't = cq for any int q. So c doesn't divide ab. ; Well, the basic problem you've run into is that the conjecture isn't true.  If a = 6, b = 3, and c = 9, then a*b = 18, and 18/9 = 2, but neither 6 nor 3 is divisible by 9.\n\nTo prove that something is true you must prove it is true for all possible values of the variables, in this case a, b, and c.  However, to prove something is false, you need only supply a single counter-example.  Thus the above example disproves the conjecture that for all integers a, b, and c if a*b is divisible by c then a or b is also divisible by c.\n\nNote that a ≠ cm and b ≠ cn does not imply that ab ≠ c(cmn).  For example, if a = 6, b = 8, c = 2, m = 4, and n = 3, then cm = 2*3 = 8 ≠6 so cm ≠ a, and cn = 2 * 3 = 6 ≠ 8 so cn ≠ b.  However, (cm)(cn) = 2 * 4 * 2 * 3 = 48, and a * b = 6 * 8 = 48, so ab = (cm)(cn).  This proves that you cannot multiply not-equalities (i.e. statements with ""doesn't equal).\n\nAlso, concluding that if c does not divide a or b implies that c does not divide ab is not the same as concluding that if c does divide ab it must also divide a or b.  This logical fallacy is equivalent to the statement that for all plants, not a tree implies not a rock, so being a rock implies being a tree.  The first statement is true: all plants that are not trees are also not rocks.  However, the second statement is clearly false, as no rocks are also trees.",4219

7,"How is blues guitar the basis for modern rock guitar? ; I was watching an instructional vid by marty friedman, and he said that you HAVE to know how to play the blues progression because all modern rock is based on it. Can anyone explain this deeper? ; That's a bit of an exaggeration.  Early rock-and-roll drew from the blues, but also from R&B and country music.  When hard rock developed in the mid-'60s, it was based almost exclusively on the blues.  Artists like the Rolling Stones (""Little Red Rooster"" is an especially good example), Cream/Eric Clapton (""Sunshine of Your Love""), and Jimi Hendrix, (""Hey Joe""), built the foundation for hard rock, and the heavy metal that developed out of it, on an exaggerated electric blues.  Though the more sophisticated hard-rock and metal bands of the seventies incorporated other influences (British folk for Led Zeppelin, jazz for Led Zeppelin), most, like Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, continued to build on the blues base.  While subsequent rock artists have drawn on influences as diverse as free-jazz and avant-garde strains of 20th century classical, especially in more underground and experimental veins, mainstream rock music has never stopped drawing on the blues, passed along from one generation to the next.",4256

In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look.

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

They only have to pay eBay from the sale price (generally .99 or less) and a small cost for the category they placed the item in to sell. The rest is their money.

Do you know how this condition is treated? ; Commonly known as pinkeye, conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inner surface of the eyelids. It is a fairly common condition and usually causes no danger to the eye or your child's vision. The inflammation can have many causes, the most common of which are infectious, allergic, and irritant.  Since your son's eyelashes are full of a crusty discharge it is likely that the cause is bacterial and will need an antibiotic eye drop.  If you cannot get him to a doctor immediately a warm washcloth will help.  When you start on the eye drops be sure to continue using them for 3 to 5 days after his eyes clear up or else you may risk having the infection return.",4425

You will have to repress your feelings of intellectual analysis.  If you are young enough to be still in college, or planning to go to college, you could do a lot worse than major in history and specialize in history of religion.  Such people are going to be necessary to the modern world of clashing religious groups.\n\nBut if you start with the academic study, and you continue to feel it is appropriate for you, then phone a local Muslim organization and ask them what to do.  Accept that they may be suspicious of you for a while; things are tense in the religious world between Muslims and the mostly Christian world.  They see white skin, they may think spy.  Be patient and friendly, and not too pushy, and I'm sure they will recognize your sincerity eventually.

2,"is Ginkgo a good herbal suplement? ; has any one tried this before? ; Medical uses\nThe extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nOut of the many conflicting research results, there seem to be basically three effects of Ginkgo extract on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals (antioxidant); and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders. Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication.\n\n Side effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ginkgo should also not be used by people who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women without first consulting a doctor.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include: possible increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, and restlessness.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced consumption should be halted immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40–200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nAnd that's My Best Answer!",4465

In the past few weeks I have seen the debate over this issue and I am wandering how people see it aside of what the media says. I do believe that a good controlled plan of imigration is good for the US, my main concern is how to deal with the 12 million people that are already here (not all Mexicans). I do disagree with those people who think that they can come to the US and want to support the flag of their country. I do not have anything against people from my country, but I do believe that if people come here they should embrace the americamn culture and its good values. I do not implied that they should forget their culture, but they came here fro the opportunity and this country can give it to them if they want it. ; I don't mind the flag waving, I think the border needs to be sealed.

1,"What is a derivative? antiderivative? ; THANX!! ; Derivative of a function is the study of microscopic and complex rate of change or infinitesimal rate of change of a curve, a process, a phenomena etc.Several changes have been taking place in this world,a macroscopic changes and uniform changes are easily countable, but complex changes are not easily accountable.To understand such changes we require the wonderful mathematical tool  called drivative, diffrentiation, diffrential etc.For example think of pouring  water into a conical vessel in drops.Here if the drops that are dripping in are uniform, it is easy to know the number of drops per minute, per hour etc.But it very difficult to find the rate of change of height of water  as the water drips in to the container (conical) and the corresponding rate of change of surface area of the water in the container.To understand such changes we move towards zero or towards a number which we call as the limit.Also a prosses may be a chemical reaction, in physics it may be a free fall of an object or an acclerated body.Moreover, consider y=x^2, the derivative of this is dy/dx = 2x, here change is not uniform as common difference in an arithmetic progression.\nWhen x=4 & 5 we have x^2= 16 & 25 ; then the difference is 9.Compare this 9 with the derivative 2x = 2*4 & 2*5 = 8 & 10.These numbers 1 more or less to 9.Of course the difference 1 is considerable when x is a small number. When x is sufficiently large this 1 becomes negligible.ie. limit as x tends to infinity the derivative of x^2 is 2x.  \nAnti-derivative is opposite to this concept. This is usually called as integration, summation, premitive etc. Here it is the study of complex accumulation.\nFor example when a point is accumulated in a single direction without break we call it a line, ie. when a point dx is integrated we get a line `x'.When line is intigrated we get a surface, that is x^2 /2. When the same is revesed we get a point . former is called integration later is called diffrentiation.",4481

9,"How dare they make mace illegal? Why? ; The government fails to keep so many creeps behind bars and then has the audacity to tell us women that we can't carry mace around for the sole purpose of self defense. I think we all have the right to go for a peaceful walk without fear of being stabbed or raped. And what perplexes me is that we're allowed to carry bear spray in bear country, but not allowed to carry mace in predatory lunatic country, which can be just about anywhere, even in the most tranquil of suburbs. ; Before you get over worked over this issue, you need to know some facts.\n\nMace has limited ability in stopping attackers and some people are not in the least affected by it. Pepper spray is much more effective, but also has problems.\n\nMost people (non-police) who carry the stuff are not trained when and how to use it and are depending on it for their front line of defense. They also will tend to get in to a bit of a panic if attacked, grab it and spray. If the wind is in the wrong direction, the mace/pepper spray may blow back on them, leaving the assailant untouched. It can also be very difficult to incapacitate a person who is very drunk and/or on drugs. The small cans of spray can also leak over time and not work when you really need it.\n\nConsider also, since mace/pepper spray is legal, the bad guys/gals can get it too and can easily get you before you get them.\n\nThere are many effective means of self defense, if one takes the time to learn the methods, that can give you a chance to get out of a confrontation. I suggest you look into them.\n\nOne clue. learning to keep your cool when a surprise situation unfolds and quickly evaluate your options is the best front line of defense you can develop.

9,"Question about the War on Terror? ; Every front on the War on Terror, both abroad and here at home, seems to ask one simple question: how far are we, as a country, willing to go to win the war? I think that as long as we hold back, there will always be places the enemy can go where we can't follow, places they can hide where we can't look, and things they can do that we can't stop. So, just how far should we take this thing? Where, if anywhere, should we draw the line? Would drawing the line anywhere be worth the possible loss of more American lives? ; I think we are unchartered waters on this one.  We have never fought an enemy of this nature before so where to draw the line and how far to take it will depend on the world's willingness to stop the terror attacks.  As we saw with Spain, not all countries view this war the same.  But, unless there is a concerted effort on the part of all governments that value freedom to destroy the terrorists throughout the world we will never end this.  Afghanistan and Iraq are the tip of the iceberg.  The Islamic terrorists, and make no mistake that that is who this war is directed at, have the ability to travel all over the world and use the tools of cowards to continue their jihad.  Since we are not fighting a standing army, and I doubt that our estimates of people involved in terrorist oganizations is close to accurate, we cannot know when we ""get them all"".  The ultimate solution will have to come from a coalition of world governments being willing to root out these organizations on their soil and drive them into a corner where they are considered, and please forgive the use of the term, lepers.  Once they are seen as un-touchable (in that no one wants to touch them or allow them safe haven) then we can talk about drawing lines.",4507

Similarly, the second formula will also not be true.  even - even = even.\n\nI hope this is what you were looking for, I was a little confused by your statement.  A more general solution exists for x=0 and y=a, y=b... as you stated but this doesn't follow your even/odd request.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEDIT: with your updated comment, I agree.  x=0 is still a trivial solution.  You could do a quick program and have it solve for the equation using brute force, if you find a hit you can use ""Proof by Example"".\n\nI'm guessing the problem isn't solvable though and you need to prove why... my discrete math is a bit rusty though, try focusing on the properties of the equation... possibly solve it graphically by comparing the expanded triangle equations.\n\nPS. it looks like the problem is solvable if both sides are perfect squares and the opposite is the square root of the sum of two squares: x^4 + y^4 = a^2 * b^2\n\nEDIT2: look at the proof of why it is impossible to make a Heronian triangle from two pythagorian triangles.

1,"What are the economic and environmental considerations of materials? ; For materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. ; Economic Considerations\n\nResearch has shown that if the soil test is below the desired level, application of phosphorus will provide yield increases that will not only pay for the treatment, but also provide additional income beyond the cost of the treatment. If the soil test is above the cut-off point, i.e. more than 20 pounds above the desired level, it will be in the best interest of the farmer to invest his capital in inputs other than phosphorus as such an addition will not result in a yield increase.\n\nLand tenure and/or availability of capital also affect the economic rate of application. For those individuals that have limited or unknown tenure, or limited capital, it is suggested that they extend the build-up period from the recommended 4 year period to 6 years or in some cases longer. Other than for the most deficient soils, this will not have an adverse impact on yield.\nEnvironmental Considerations:\n\nThere is no documented evidence that excess phosphorus in water supplies creates a human health hazard. Rather, when phosphorus enters surface waters in substantial concentration, it becomes a pollutant by contributing to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants, and, thus to accelerated eutrophication of surface waters.\n\nEutrophication is the process where through nutrient enrichment of surface waters, algae and other aquatic plant growth is increased. This associated increase in aquatic plant growth and their ultimate decomposition limits the use of surface waters for recreation, fisheries, industry, and drinking. In most water bodies, phosphorus is the element most limiting for plant growth. When critical concentrations of phosphorus are exceeded by environmental pollution, eutrophication occurs. The critical concentration of phosphorus for eutrophication that is frequently cited is 0.01 parts per million (ppm).\n\nPhosphorus contamination of surface waters comes from point source emissions (industry and waste water from sewage treatment systems) and non-point sources with agriculture being the primary non-point source. Over the last couple of decades, point source contamination has been markedly decreased. As a result, agriculture has been designated as the primary source of phosphorus entering surface waters. The primary mechanisms by which agriculture contributes phosphorus to surface water is through runoff and erosion. Movement of phosphorus through tile does occur on sandy and organic soils and through macropores of fine textured soils. Studies in the U.S. have found very low concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in tile line effluents, but frequently they exceed a projected critical value of 0.01 ppm phosphorus. If the sorption capacity of the profile of a fine textured soil were to become phosphorus saturated to near the depth of tile lines, there would be a continual excessive supply of bioavailable phosphorus in that tile line outflow. If accepted agronomic practices are followed for phosphorus management, phosphorus released in tile line flow will be minimal.\n\nPhosphorus from agricultural sources enters the stream as either dissolved phosphorus or particulate phosphorus. Dissolved phosphorus is comprised mostly of orthophosphate which is immediately available for uptake by algae. Particulate phosphorus is attached to soil and organic matter particles and as such is not immediately available for plant use. The fate of particulate phosphorus is dependent on the characteristics of the receiving water body. If the existing sediment is low in phosphorus, a portion of the dissolved phosphorus may be sorbed to the sediment. However, if the sediment entering the water body is high in particulate phosphorus, a portion of it may be desorbed into dissolved phosphorus over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThere are several factors that influence the rate of movement of phosphorus from agricultural lands. These include inherent soil phosphorus level, tillage, ground cover, rate and method of applicat",4583

Whatever the reason, it is not always just a representation of childhood grievances; like one of the others here said, you can have a fine childhood.

But on the other hand why stay and waste the company's time and money if I know I am not going to stay. What do you think? ; I can completely relate to your situation. I think it might be worth it to stay at your current job because I really feel that it takes about 2-3 months to warm up to a new job and new work environment. You might not like some of the task you are doing now, but as you learn and have more experience at your workplace, your boss will be able to see that you are capable of doing the tasks given and will be more willing to give you tasks that challenge you.

We have all the paper work and agreement but could not find a good collection agency they can tackle this client. What is the best way for us to get our money.\n\nAny idea? ; If you invented or developed the product you have the initial intellectual property rights. You need to protect these by having them registered. If you have not done so and the other party registers them you will have to take steps to have the register corrected. To collect money from an overseas UK client you would have to take out a writ and serve this according to the rules of court. If the writ is not challenged then you can have a judgement awarded in your favour otherwise you will need to prove that the amount is owed. Whether you went through an agent or not is irrelevant as the principal is responsible for the acts of his agents. You should, however, consider naming the agent as a party in your writ. When you have a judgement this can be registered with the High Court in London and will be enforceable against the client.",4714
0,"Unexpected relatives arrive for Thanksgiving.? ; We had unexpected relatives arrive for Thanksgiving.  There are eight of them in their family, 2 adults and the rest children.  I had a planned dinner for my immediate family members only.  These people just showed up about an hour into the meal.  Of course I fed everyone, however it seems to me that this was very very rude.  How should I handle this situation if it arises at another holiday, such as Christmas.  My daughter said that it was obvious to her that I was upset with them just showing up (but it must have not bothered them - they did not seem to notice).  I was hoping that my ""body language"" would give them the hint that this is not okay.  With that many children one might ask did they have food for Thanksgiving - I have to guess that they could afford food because they rented a cabin nearby for the weekend. I am very confused with how to handle this in the future.  My husband was also upset, however he would have a hard time saying anything to these people. ; I would take it as a compliment.  They obviously had no one else to spend the holiday with, whether it was by choice or not.  By their actions they seem as though they may not be the most appreciative family.  I would address it with them when it is not during a holiday or family time.  This will cause unneeded tension between the family.  Explain to them that you would not mind if they were to come over as long as it was planned and you did not get caught off guard.  Also, they may have rented a cabin but it may be all a front.

1,"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical(china syndrome) would it actually melt it's way to china? ; This is prob a stupid question, I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome. ; All nuclear plants that are producing power must be ""critical.""  The plant is shut down when it is ""subcritical.""  A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes ""supercritical.""  A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it.  A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world (like anything else that falls).  Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe, the core would fall toward China, thus the China syndrome.  Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth.  For those with a wild imagination, China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core.  None-the-less, China Syndrome is a catchy phrase.",4732

I to have suffered with many different phobias; as a child it was injections (both dentists and doctors), and Dogs; now it is the feeling of fear itself that I fear. (Because of years of panic attacks)\n\nI can tell you what helps, if you need to take an oral pill (tranquilizer) if you are really bad (one every night before going to bed for a short time) or (half an hour before you need to go to the doctor for an appointment involving an injection). \n*However this will not teach you too become brave or help you cope with your underlining fear which has become a phobia. \n\nI suggest you learn to relax through different sources.\n\nFirstly you can do positive self talk as your fear comes from negative thoughts causing you to have a chemical release in the brain which in turn causes the physical sensations of heart racing, sweating, feelings of faintness, fear, anxiety, nausea, light headedness, numbness, and so on…..oh yeah feelings of unreality is another one.\n\nNext learn relaxation or meditation either through physical participation in yoga classes or by listening to these sorts of cd, tape, or videos. There are hypnotic and relaxation available through JB Hi Fi stores designed to relax and strengthen your subconscious.  Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.  However this option is the most expensive and time consuming because it takes many sessions and time to feel you can trust or open up fully to another person.\n\n\n\n*If you use drugs as a crutch you can become addicted and that would start a whole new problem. \nP.S. the side affects of many tranquilizer drugs are feelings of anxiety and panic which you don’t want anyway.\n\n*The body is affected the same with legal and illicit drugs (downers or relaxants) like tranquillizers, sleeping pills or (marijuana, heroin, and alcohol) \n*Stimulants which are (speed, & cocaine) (cigarettes = nicotine), (tea & coffee =caffeine), and (ice & ecstasy which is often a combination of both stimulants and relaxants). \n*Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Marijuana are most accepted by the general public however they cause the most disease related deaths. Through internal organ diseases, like *Cancers and Blood clots (causing amputations, strokes and heart attacks) \n*Lung diseases from asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer.  \n*Liver diseases from damage trying to alienate the body of toxic poisons and chemicals associated with medications and alcohol over years. \n*Hepatitis, sclerosis, and cancers of the liver.  \n*Marijuana has a chemical THC which our body has receptor in our brain and we also store for long periods in our blood and fat cells; (up to one month each time you smoke just one joint). Regular bong smokers and users will cause many different chronic health problems including lung disease (as the same toxic chemicals are in tobacco and marijuana excepting nicotine which is a stimulant) mental health suffers with paranoia, anxiety, fear, loss of memory, loss of appetite or increased appetite for sweets, loss of motivation, poor health, poor sleeping patterns and a dependency to use marijuana to get to sleep.

5,"facts about javelen? ; history ; Javelin throw\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nA high school athlete throwing the javelin.The javelin throw is an athletics (track and field) throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fibreglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber. Because of its potential danger, it is not always included in track and field meets; for instance, Michigan high school track and field does not include javelin.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Competition and throws \n2 Javelin redesigns \n3 History and the javelin at the Olympics \n4 World records \n5 Famous Javelin Throwers \n5.1 Women \n5.2 Men \n5.3 Top Ten longest throwers of all time (current 1986 model)- men \n \n\n\n[edit]\nCompetition and throws\nRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws or six when they are placed to the eighth position, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimeter. The javelin's point must touch the ground first for the throw to be legal. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface from which they must release the javelin. The run-up culminates in a 40 degree fan emanating from a point 8m behind the line. Throws are measured from the point of landing to the inside of the painted line with the measuring tape co-linear with the point of landing and the focal point of the fan. Javelin throwers also normally use spikes unlike other throwers, with eleven small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.\n\nJavelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more similar physical characteristics to those athletes rather than the bulky frames of the strength throwers. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 70 mph (113 km/h).\n\n[edit]\nJavelin redesigns\nIn 1986, the men's javelin (800 g) was redesigned because of the prodigious distances being thrown culminating in a world record throw of over 104m by the then East German thrower, Uwe Höhn. The javelin throw was in danger of being banished to outside the arena on safety grounds so the javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved further away from the centre of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act) so that the javelin had a downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% and also causing the javelin to stick in. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g) was similarly redesigned.\n\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.\n\n[edit]\nHistory and the javelin at the Olympics\nThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1908. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. The objective there, however was to throw at a target rather than for distance.\n\n[edit]\nWorld records\nThe world record for men, at 98.48 meters, is held by Jan Železný from the Czech Republic, set at Jena, Germany, on May 25, 1996. The world record for women, at 71.70 meters, is held by Osleidys Menéndez from Cuba, set at Helsinki, Fi",4760

DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the ""eve"" network of today's Internet. \n\nPeople behind it: Licklider, Lawrence Roberts, Paul Baran for the military\nFirst node went live: Oct 29, 1969, UCLA\nBirth place: UCLA campus\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by January 1, 1983 (this is technically the birth of the Internet), when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nName first given to it: NSFNet\nFirst operational: Jan 1 1983 (birth of internet as we know it)\nNational campuses - birthplace of internet framework\n\nAs of January 2006, over 1 billion people use the Internet according to Internet World Stats",4796

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree.

However, if you can wait till next year you can differ your capital gains tax.\n\nIf you are putting money into the fund then it is best to invest after the distrubtion date.

In other words,  your total account value will remain unchanged. However, the capital gain distrubtions may be taxable (If not in an IRA), and therefore, it is best to differ your taxes to next year (Assuming that you are in the same tax bracket next year)",4878

When solid, the molecular bonds of the material are so dense that they let little or no light pass between them, thus the ""milky"" appearance of the wax.  When heated, the molecular bonds of the material are so broken apart that they easily allow light to pass through and so appear ""transparent.""",4887

5,"Any Ideas On What To Do On The Weekends With Your Husband And 5 Month Baby When It Is .? ; LIKE GOING TO THE ZOO,SHOPPING,ECT. ; A five month old wouldn't enjoy the zoo, but if you want to go, five months is a good time if the baby can sleep in a stroller. If your little one must take a nap in her/his crib, then forgo the long outing. Five month old babies are amused by anything, as you know, but only in small doses. I think you should try to find local places that take only a short drive to and from - that way you maximize your time at the place you want to be, and your baby probably won't fall asleep in the car on the way back if it's a short trip. I recommend just staying in your yard (if you have one) and playing or gardening; there are lots of things outside that would interest a five month old. Buy a bag of rice and dump it in a bowl; let him/her mess around with it outside, then hose it away when s/he is done. Buy a flat of cheap annuals along with whatever other flowers/vegetables you would like to grow; give your baby a clump of flowers (minus much of the soil) and let him destroy them (it's a great learning experience). You may want to take off his clothes before you do that.  :o)  The thing about outings with a baby is it can be more tiring than you may think.",4892

If it were timed just right, by having the Metro drive up onto the ramp of the one semi just as that semi drove onto the ramp of the semi in front of it, etc., is it conceivable that the Metro could break the sound barrier?\n\nIt seems that relative to the ground, the metro will be gaining the speed of each truck in the line.

3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

2,"Milk... cancer? ; I happen to hear this rumor about milk being a cause of Cancer.. I looked it up in google and found quite a few links regarding this... it comes to me as a shock... Is it True?? ; Cow's milk doesn't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe worst part about cow's milk is the process it goes through to get from the cow's udder to your grocery store.   Typically, it is altered beyond recognition.  It is standardized, fortified, pasteurized and homongenized.  In other words, it has been taken apart and put back together again, not always in the same proportions. Then it will be cooked and emulsified.\n\nHowever, many humans actually have mild allergies to the substance, which is nutrionally incompatible with their bodies.  In these cases, milk consumption can trigger acne outbreaks, sinusitis, constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nOn the other hand, those who experience no allergic reactions can drink it with no problems, and will wholeheartedly stand out on the streets and proclaim, ""Milk is good for you!  Drink it by the gallon!""  And for them, it may be.  But it's not for everyone.\n\nSo, what transforms an otherwise  healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens?  It all starts with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass; and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than they a traditional cow.\n\nThen, the cows are given antibiotics to keep them well. Their milk is then pasteruized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed; lactase, which assimilates lactose; galactose, which  assimilates galactose; phosphatase, for the assimilation of calcium. Literally dozens of precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteruization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to disease.\n\nHope this helped explain it a little better.  Raw, organic, whole cow's milk is in no way cancer-causing.  It's really more the process it goes through to become store-ready that could, in a sense, contribute to cancer development in some people.",4966

This retinoic acid derivative is also used to treat other skin diseases, although it is known to cause birth defects in humans and should be used with extreme caution (preferably not at all) during pregnancy. \n\nSide effects are not common, but include chest pain, dizziness, fast heartbeat (more common for injection), and skin rash.\n \ncc",4971

I agree with 'andytheba..' and 'itschris', above. The line represents the STRING (top line = highest note-thinnest string, bottom line = lowest note-thickest string) \n\nThe numbers DO refer to the fret number (0 = open or un-fretted string/ 1= 1st fret on that particular string 2= 2nd fret and so on and so forth) Where a number repeats ---2-3-5-5-5-5-5--- , this indicates the number of time you pluck or pick the string\n\nTabs are designed primarily to help guide you through a A PIECE OF RECORDED MUSIC YOU EITHER KNOW OR HAVE ACCESS TO. Tabs sometimes, though rarely, contain some musical information. This is similar  to standard musical notation. A large number of tabs, however, just provide you with the basic information and you use the recording to to reference it.\n\nAn example :  ----0-2-3-5--- played on the A string (second fattest) is telling you to play the notes A, B, C and D. If the numbers read ----0-2-4-5--- they would be telling you to play the notes A, B, C# and D.   Since you already read standard music notation - the piano music - you have a glorious head start but, as I said, alot of Tablature (tabs) dispenses with all the note value notation and provides you with just the 'finger pathway' through the music you listen to or want to learn.

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness. It is often brought on by stressful situations, such as relationship difficulties, health problems, the aftermath of an accident or the death of a loved one. \n\nThe mental illness known as a ""nervous breakdown"" may also be something like panic attacks, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder. \n\nSurveys show that about one-third of Americans feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown at some point. Studies estimate that 50-million Americans suffer some form of mental illness in their lifetime. \n\nThere are many disorders that can fit within the criteria of ""Nervous Breakdown"", but those that most commonly occur are those related to:\n•Anxiety \noGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \noPanic Disorder \n•Panic Attacks \n•Trauma Disorders \noPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder \noAcute Stress Disorder \n•Psychotic Disorders \noSchizophrenia \n•Mood (Affective) Disorders \noDepression \noBipolar Disorder",5073

7,"How about this joke? ; Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic. Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. \nBy the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. \n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady. \n\nTwenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless.

5,"Why did USC move ahead of Michigan in the BCS poll? ; Both teams have one loss.  Michigan loss to the number 1 team, Ohio State, at Ohio State, in a close game.  USC loss to the number 24 team.  Michigan gave the only loss to number 7 Wisconsin, and beat number 10 Notre Dame badly at Notre Dame.  USC beat number number 9 Arkansas and beat Notre Dame at USC.\n\nSo what logic dictates that USC is ranked higher than Michigan?  Or is it just that a so-called national championship game between OSU and USC would be better than one between OSU and Michigan?  \n\nIsn't the BCS a total farce? ; It's politics plain and simple.  The BCS changes it's own rules after each season because they realize their system doesn't work. The voters are biased. Boomer Esaison, who is a voter in the Harris Poll stated he planned on putting Michigan at #4 this week.

2,When i have sex with my wife i usually come within 30 seconds? ; When i have sex with my wife i usually come with in 30 seconds and then we usually never try the second time.\nCan you guys really help me how to solve my problem ; Did you practise holding back when you masturbated growing up. Basically every time I masturbated growing up I'm practising holding back and recognizing the feeling of getting close then backing off. Its just slowing down or slightly changing your rhythm. Its a practise thing. Also pulling out (if slowing down doesn't help) and tapping your glans (tip) against your wife's vagina will stop you from climaxing if you are getting close. (the part facing away from your belly button) Other ways to help prevent climax. Wear a condom. Masturbate relatively often or have sex more often. I have a much harder time holding back if I haven't ejaculated in a while. Experiment with your body in this regard. They also have creams that supposedly delay climax. I've never tried them so I don't know how effective they are. The solution is in here. Good luck.,5093

0,"How could a ""loving"" God have a plan for my life that was so cruel? (christianity answers only please) ; Though I have never stopped believing in God, some of the things that I have gone through in my life have made me doubt his ""holy"" purpose for my life.  My home life could use a lot of inprovement (namely my father, though our relationship did inprove during my softmore year of H.S. i grew bigger than him, and thus dont fear him anymore, we just avoid each other now), in a period of 2 years i had to bury 4 of my best friends (no one should ever have to go through that), and i could go on for a long time.  I began to serve God when i was about 12, and i served him with all of my heart, i finnally had hope, i knew that he cared for me, he was going to make my life better, but he never did anything.  the only improvement that i experienced, was when i stood up against my father, but it was a sin (""Honor thy father and mother"")  If he's so ""loving"", why is a direct act against one of his commandments the only thing that ever helped me? ; At tims in our lives we pass through some very difficult situations and we begin to wonder why certain things are happpening to us, it is almost as if we are alone in this world. It is almost as if nobody cares and we are greatly troubled, our faith and beliefs are really shaken.\n\nWe may even begin to wonder why our loved ones have to die, we question why there is war in this world. We are more troubled when we see innocent people die on in accidents caused by troubled or drunk drivers.\n\nAt other times we are greatly troubled by our family members and our family situations, we wonder why we are in certain family dies, we even question if there is indeed a creator and why are all bad things keep happening, sucide might even be the perfect solution to our predicaments but:\n\nthere is this voice reaching out to us from a loving Father who we may even try to question wheter or not he knows our situation, the word reaches out and tells us that THOUGH SORROW MAY ENDURE FOR SOMETIME, JOY COMES IN THE MORNING.\n\nit is true, you may be passing through really tough times, i have been there, i have even attempted sucide. however i have realised the depth of My Heavenly Father's love even though it is still very difficult for me (to fathom the depth  of this love). I have realised that EVERYTHING WORKS TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE WHO TRULY BELIEVE IN HIM. i know that at times i may pass through some very tough times and think God is not there, but i have come to realise that no matter how bad that situation might be, by trusting in God, He will and He always certainly turns it around for my own. Besides at times when he seems the most silent, i realise that he is only carrying me.  \n\nIt is true that doubts will come and your faaher may even make situations worse for you, but one thing i can certainly assure you of is that God knows of your situation, and do not let your doubt steal away the Father's love for you.  \n\nContinue praying for your father and realise that in honouring your father you should love the Lord your God with all your heart and all of your strenght (by not doing what is against his will). At  times our parents may be pretty difficult, but we must realise that some of them are only trying to show thier love in the way the know our to.\n\nThough going a ggainst God's ways at times gives us a perfect solution, but if we truly search deep within our hearts we often always find out that we only get temporary joy. It may be that dishonouring your father really helped you, but I do not know wheter it invoved your going agsinst God's will.\n\nGod's plans FOR you are of good and not evil, he will certainly give you a hope and a future (JEREMAIH 29:11).\n\nAytime it seems as if the doors of this world are shutting down on you remember that:\n\nEVEN THOUGH YOU WALK THROUGH THE SHADOW OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH, YOU SHOULD FEAR KNOW EVIL, FOR THE LORD IS WITH YOU...(Psalm 23:4)\n\nYour serving and believing in him is no guarranty that you will not pass through problems and bad situations but it is an assurance that he will give you joy, peace and strenght at all times so continue like never before:\n\nTRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND DO NOT RELY ON O YOUR OWN INSIGHT, IN ALL OF YOUR WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AND HE WILL MAKE YOUR PATH STRAIGHT (PROV 3:5-6)\n\nmail me if you want: bilewomo@yahoo.com",5099

If the EM wave can pass through very easily, the material has a low extinction coefficient.

0,"who was first in the land of israel; arabic or jewish people or other? ; I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land and actually how the whole thing started   were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left? Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now? ; >>>>I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land….\n\nThe trouble is that the question makes no sense. Both historically and mythologically the Jews were Arabs. They aren’t a different people, they are simply a different religious sect. Prior to the rise of Islam around 1500 years ago the Middle East and North Africa was home to thousands of different religions, and one of those religions was Judaism. The different sects were in a state of near perpetual war with their neighbours as well as with the great powers like Babylon and Egypt.\n\nFrom a purely historical perspective it seems that one of the numerous religious sects living in Palestine gained the upper hand, either through theocratic means or through warfare or a combination of the two. Gradually they absorbed all the other people of that region and formed the state of Israel.\n\nBear in mind also that even at the time of Christ present day Israel wasn’t entirely Jewish occupied or controlled. Much of it was in Samaria, the Samaritans being a Hebrew but not Jewish sect that didn’t accept the absolute sanctity of the temple.\n\nSo as you can see it’s not a simple case of saying the Arabs or Jews were there first. Historically Jews are Arabs and Jews never historically occupied all of what is now Israel.\n\n>>>> were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left?\n\nA little from column A, a little from column B.\n\nRemember how at the time of Jesus Israel had been occupied by the Romans?  Needless to say the Jews didn’t like that, and the situation was further aggravated by the Romans doing various stupid and offensive things. Eventually the people of Jerusalem and much of Judeaea got fed up and rebelled. A lot of Romans were killed, a lot more Jews were killed, a lot of Jews killed themselves rather than be captured. \n\nThe Romans ascribed the unrest to a religious source and decided that enough was enough and The Temple was torn down. \n\nWithout the temple to sacrifice at the Jews had no strong reason to cling to Israel, and combined with Roman persecution they mostly decided to leave in several waves over the next few hundred years.\n\nSo you could say that it was a voluntary Exodus, but it was just as much a refugee movement.\n\n>>>>Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now?\n\nBasically because\n\n1)It is the traditional Jewish homeland and a lot of Jews wanted it back.\n2)Jews had a lot of political clout in Washington after the war.\n3) Jews had been regularly slaughtered in Europe over the last 2000 years, and the recent Nazi holocaust was by far the worst example. A lot of people tjought that it would be a good idea not let it keep happening, and decided the best way to do that would be to give the Jews their own country outside Europe.\n\nCombine those three factors and you see a simple solution to all problems/ The fact that Palestine was a British colony/protectorate at the time and Britain wanted to offload all its colonies as fast as possible helped no end.\n\nBenji Man  wrote:\n>>>>>Africa is the cradle of civ so I will go with an early nomadic african people.\n\nAfrica is not the cradle of civilisation.

1,"Does blood plasma contain oxygen or fibrin protein? ; This question was on my exam today. I looked it up but still not sure. Oxygen is insoluble in water and plasma is made up of 90% water. Also fibrin is a substance converted from fibrinogen protein. If fibrinogen protein is in plasma, does this mean that fibrin protein is in blood plasma? The question on the exam asked what was NOT in plasma: oxygen, fibrin protein, antibody, or electrolyte? ; Plasma contains a very small fraction of oxygen.Almost all oxygen is loaded in the RBC.Fibrinogen has to be converted into fibrin and this is possible when the platelets rupture to release thrombokinase.This enzyme converts prothrombin into thrombin which acts upon firbrinogen to convert it into fibrin.However this is dangerous as much of fibrin in the plasma will block the flow of blood in the  blood vessel.The blood clot is bunch of fibrin molecules.

5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.  Many people thought they'd fall apart once they lost Mulder and Hudson, but they keep contending.",5172

But if you've no written contract then your on thin ice as it where!. You only have the employers word for it, & of course an employer can make up the rules as they go along if that suits them? (yes! it can be very tricky).\n\nIf you've now completed your notice period of six weeks, your fully within your rights to leave immediately and without having to give yet further notice to end the employment.\n\n**The employer sounds like they made you a ""verbal offer"" of a better salary ( a carrott to make you stay on!!) or job promotion. However, if the verbal offer hasnt materialised or was broken i.e. not kept too! or apears to be just an empty promiss. Again your within your legal rights to leave, you havent broken any emplyment laws here as far as I can see.\n\n**I woudnt believe a word of anything offered further as an incentive to stay. i.e  the employer or manager is NOT to be trusted if they dont deliver on any promises made. Sadly you can only go by the past track record of how they have behaved towards you.\n\nHope that might be of use? IR",5242

Three years later, in 2001, he was set to play the lead in the NBC show ""UC:Undercover,"" but his commitments to ABC forced him to back out just four days before the pilot was shot. Shortly after, in September 2001, he inked a new seven-figure deal with ABC to develop a series for the 2002-2003 television season, but once again, the deal failed to produce a series. Later, in 2002, he turned down the chance to play the lead in ""CSI:Miami"" and backed out of the lead role in ""Boomtown"" at the last minute. In 2004 he was attached to star in a Jerry Bruckheimer produced drama for NBC called ""City of Dreams"" as an L.A. private investigator who caters to the rich and famous. However, script problems eventually caused that project to be scrapped. Finally, in August 2004 he inked a deal to join the cast of ""The West Wing"" for the 2004-2005 season, and a few weeks later, made a separate deal with ABC and Touchstone studios to develop and star in a new series after his time on ""The West Wing.""\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal quotes \n""They'd say, 'Explain this again: If you finish this degree, you'll be able to teach high-school drama?'"" -- Former ""NYPD Blue"" on his parents' reaction after he told them he wanted to be an actor - USA Weekend (August 1999)\n\n""Celebrity hits like a bomb.

0,"Apologetics, No. 4:  If we all evolved then why are there still apes? ; This is a common question asked by people who are not familiar with the concept of evolution.\n\nThe evidence from the fossil record, from genetics, from molecular biology and so on, is that we are a species of ape, closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas, less closely related to other primates, less closely still to other mammals, and so on.  The reason that there are still other apes is that they and we had a common ancestor several million years ago.  Chimpanzees, for example, have evolved just as much in the intervening time as we have - Biologists do not say that chimps or monkeys we see today are our ancestors, as is sometimes mistakenly claimed.\n\nHence the ""why are there still apes?"" question is invalid, and due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nAgreed? ; Yep. I totally agree that it is due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nI once was told, as an example of why evolution was faulty, that ""you cannot put a typewriter into a closet and open up the door a few days later and expect it to be a computer"". I remember explaining the relationship between the computer and typewriter and that the ideas, concepts, etc that the technology did evolve, but that certain elements of the typewriter were carried over to the computer (like the keyboard and how it is styled).

I catagorised it under women's health but this time will try politics.  I dont believe I can get in trouble with yahoo by using the health term menstrual cycle.  Briefly she made two bad decisions.  One was appointing a man who has had problems with honesty in the past and the second is taking off the Congressional oversight intelligence committe a highly qualified woman and putting on a man who was fired as a judge for giving police information to criminals.  Could she have had severe menstrual symptoms that caused her to make these decisions.

This could be a real problem if we had a woman president because all North Korea would have to do is to fire off a missile and if it happened to be that time of the month for her then she'd just up and nuke them.

What do you LIKE to do? What do you think ""feels"" like a natural skill to you? Is this electrical work, gears and mechanics, chemistry, computers, etc? Go with a natural fit, don't force yourself to try and love computers just because you think it's the most successful route. After you have that hammered out, find out what is in demand in your area or someplace that you want to move (yes, there are unemployed engineers with skills that don't fit the location). An easy way to do this is look at some of the job boards and find out what types of engineers people are hiring. \n\nPicking a school: this is VERY important. You must make sure the engineering school is ACCREDITED by ABET. Anyone can legally hand out non-accredited engineering degrees. ABET schools are a whole different ballgame. Don't waste your time and money! \n\nOk, you picked a school, great! At this point, there are 3 things you need to do: 1. keep your GPA over 3.2. 2. Join at least one engineering association that fits your discipline (ASME, SAE, ACM, AUVSI...many to choose from). 3. Participate in internships and/or co-ops.

5,"What can be done to fix the BCS? ; The BCS is the biggest crock ever conceived. As of the Week 12 ranking, there are some inexplicable rankings. USC: 3rd? I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th). Furthermore, the Pac-10 as a league is laughable, they have one or two powerhouses that basically play scrimmages for a season and have an easy roll into the BCS bids. Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid. A playoff system needs to be established to discover a true champion, maybe use the bowl games as the playoffs leading to an ""Uber"" bowl game.

I am training my daughter for track and I use the hill and the parachute method. All it is is stamina. AND your mind. \n                Have you been giving your body plenty of rest? Without rest it won't really matter how intense the training. You'll only defeat the purpose. When you do a set with weights you need to allow your body 1 whole minute to regain oxygen and supply it to the torn down muscles. When you run you need to mix up the speed. Airbourn shuffle at the beginning then gradually work it up then back down to the Airbourn Shuffle again. Then the next work out you work it backwards. It gives your body a shock an da variety. But again you need to get plenty of rest. How are you eating? That is a diet that you need to see a dietricionist for. ADVICE; Don't do the Adkins diet for runners and track people. It takes away the water intake and you dehydrate the body. Matter of fact I think that diet should be banned. \n                 Other than that you need to experiment with yourself and see what works for your body and what doesn't.

3,"what are the guide of supplication pls answer me now i need a assignment pls..? ; pls help me plsss.... ; Supplication (also known as petitioning) is the most common form of prayer, wherein a person asks a supernatural deity to provide something, either for the person who is praying or for someone else on whose behalf a prayer of supplication is being made.\n\nIn Christianity, the prayer of supplication for health by and on behalf of the sick is referenced in early Christian writings in the New Testament, especially James 5:13-16. One example of supplication is the Catholic ritual of novena (from novem, the Latin word for ""nine"") wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days. This ritual began in France and Spain during the Middle Ages when a nine day period of hymns and prayers led up to a Christmas feast, a period which ended with gift giving. A contemporary Christian example of supplication is the practice of the Daily Prayer for Peace by the Community of Christ where a member prays for peace each day at a specified time.\n\nIn Islam, the Arabic word duˤā (plural adˤiya) is used to refer to supplications. Adˤiya may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, Persian and Turkish. In Islam, duˤā tends to mean personal prayer. Muslim prayer beads usually have 33 or 99 beads to represent God's many names.\n\nThe concept is perfectly at home with secular use. The supplicant may also be described as a suppliant but the former word is more commonly used. The key meaning is of a request by the lesser person in an acknowledged unequal relationship",5511

It's $29.50.\n\nAlso, here's an article on yogajournal.com that may be of some help:\n\nYoga for Multiple Sclerosis\n\nI have multiple sclerosis and have been practicing Iyengar yoga for a few months. It's been very beneficial. Is there anything I can focus on to bring more progress? \n\nBy Baxter Bell\n\n— Jessica Howland, Kihei, Hawaii \n\nBaxter Bell's reply:\n Jessica, your entry into hatha yoga with the Iyengar method was a fortuitous choice. The ability to adapt the poses with props can be particularly beneficial with multiple sclerosis (MS), since flare-ups can affect strength, balance, and coordination. \nIt’s also important for you to know about a very unique Iyengar teacher, Eric Small (located in the Los Angeles area), whose personal story of developing MS in his late teens and reclaiming his health through his study with Mr. Iyengar is almost legendary. His experience eventually led him to work with the National MS Society to create a yoga teacher-training program for teachers who want to work with students with MS. I was fortunate enough to participate in this course in 2001 with Eric as the lead instructor. \n\nStudying with an MS-trained instructor can improve your chances of moving through the practice at an appropriate pace for whatever stage of the MS cycle you may find yourself in. In addition, you will learn specific sequences designed for challenges such as fatigue, constipation, problems with digestion, lack of mental clarity, or balance. Balance, for example, can be addressed with asanas such as Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Virabhadrasana I (Warrior Pose I) and Virabhadrasana II (Warrior Pose II), and Trikonasana (Triangle Pose). \n\nFor a student with MS, there are three types of symptoms that hatha yoga directly addresses: fatigue and heat intolerance, numbness in the limbs and loss of coordination, and loss of flexibility and balance. Fatigue and heat intolerance appear to be the most limiting factors to MS students. To counter these limitations, students learn to master the breath and practice restorative postures. Both techniques cool the body and calm the nervous system. The simple breathing technique of lengthening the exhalation a little longer than the inhalation helps quiet the nervous system. It’s been observed that heat, stress, and tension can cause temporary worsening of MS symptoms, so keep the pace of practice relaxed but focused—keeping the body just shy of sweating is important. \n\nMS can also result in a daily battle with numbness of the arms and legs, muscle spasms, and loss of coordination. The system of yoga emphasizes stretching and breathing, which can release tension and improve circulation and body awareness. Yoga practice can also facilitate harmony between the muscular and nervous systems of the body, possibly resulting in more fluid movement and relief from muscle tension. As a student’s level of body awareness improves, she can begin to recognize the first signs of stress on her system before it overwhelms her. \n\nFinally, in addition to evolving body awareness, yoga increases flexibility and balance. The poses increase the range of motion in the joints and improve muscle tone, and work of most of the body’s muscle groups. \n\nYour yoga practice can be tailored according to your needs. If you are in a period of remission and your balance is intact, you can often do most of poses practiced in an ordinary class setting. During periods of relapse, stay in the groove of practicing by doing a modified practice, for example lying supine on the floor or utilizing chairs and the wall. \n\nThe effect of hatha yoga on MS is of such great interest that the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine division has funded a study of the effects of yoga on MS patients. Preliminary data shows improvement speci",5512

2,"this is me 17 wit the rupture disc  i been to the doctor he said surgery? ; is there any way it will heal on its own i kind of scared to get surgery on my back thnk you for you responds ; A ruptured disk is no laughing matter. I will have to assume that the rupture is in a critical area to be recommended surgery. And I understand how scary it is to be going under surgery.\n\nThe suggestion of getting an epidural-steroid injection is a smart idea. It is usually used for bulging disks that rest on nerves or to reduce complications/issues in a post surgical environment. I had this done both before and after the partial laminectomy on my L5-S1 disk.\n\nFor me, I had to come to grips that surgery would be the only way out of the pain I was experiencing. I was in a rear-end collision (I was the one hit) and it ruptured a healthy disk that went untreated for 6 months (25 weeks to the day). I suffer for that delay (and it is in litigation with Worker's Comp). Even when I found that the surgery was being scheduled (and gratefully so), I was terrified the day before. I could not sleep, rest, or even get it off my mind.\n\nThe doc eben asked me the morning of my surgery (he is not quick to cut) if this is what I wanted. He told me that there was a 30% chance that I will not be healed and that of the 30%, there was a 50% chance that I would be paralyzed down the left side. My only question to him was ""Will the pain end?"" He said ""Yes"" and that cinched it.\n\nI am not saying that surgery is the answer. I am saying that being scared is okay. Even with 2 months of being ready for the inevitable surgery, I was still afraid the night before. I knew the risks, I knew the possible complications. I am glad that I did have the surgery. With the proper follow-up care and adherance to physicians' orders, you can heal remarkably well. And depending on which disk it is, you can be relatively back to normal as if the repairs were never needed.\n\nFor me, I will never be able to do what I used to. But then again, it was untreated for 6 months and it is a primary load-bearing disk.\n\nI hope this has helped.",5523

However, science itself completely rejects materialism. \nThe ancient Greek dogma “Nothing exists apart from matter”, became mixed up with science in the nineteenth century, and even came to be the basic foundation of science.

(Diff. administrations but same Lord.)  The gifts are for increase in good.   The Word of wisdom , Word of knowledge, Faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, discerning, tongues / languages, interpretation of tongues / languages.

Anointing was the inaugural ceremony for priests\n\nI think the latter portion of the definition is the most applicable to this usage.  As you know, all Born Again believers are priests according to the Order of Melchizedek, with Jesus as our High Priest.  This ""chrisma"" is given to us at the time we're saved to show we're approved priests.  This annointing includes the giving of spiritual gifts.  The only difference is that the annointing shows we're priests; the gifts permit us to carry out an individual ministry to the glory of God. \n\nPeace.",5534

Do you think its a wise investment? or i would rather invest it in real estate bcos im thinking about the inflation,the value of money or purchasing power of money wont be the same after 17 yrs when i reach the age of 45. PLEASE HELP! ; I don't know what Php mean.. I guess you are somewhere outside of the United States.\n\nAnyway, let me explain what an investment in a life policy is. First, this investment is not for your retirement. This investment is known as a ""cash value"" in the life insurance industry. If you wanted to use it anytime, you will have to borrow it and pay back with interest. This interest does not go back into your investment, but rather kept by the insurance company. If you miss any premiums or decide to stop paying in the future, the insurance company will use your cash value to pay for it. When you die, you will lose all cash value and your family will only get the death benefit.\n\nWhat I would do? Buy a 30 year term policy with Php500,000 coverage. You said you want to invest in real estate. You may do that, but I recommend investing in mutual funds too. When your term policy expires, you probably won't need life insurance if you invest wisely and continue to put away money each month.",5548

So I can be a bit more helpful . After you go into your stretch from the wind up what is the position of your trail leg into your stretch do have a habbit of pushing off the mound . Not good gets you into bad habbits .Its more like a pulling off the mound into the stride then pushing into the release . \nA good practice for this is stand at the mound go into your routine simulate your movements to the place go step by step every motion check your body position into each step. Break it down steps 1 to 5  \n\n1.your starting stance Check your balance \n2.your raise into your windup check balance look at your footing \n\n3. from windup into your stride check balance arm position did you get proper waist rotation did you push off the mound. \n\n4 look at your arm are you at your right release point .is it in correct position if not at a perfect point gonna cause loss of velocity and cause improper control of the pitch.\n\n5 check your balance after the stretch do you still have proper balance.\n \n\n\ncauses balance issues and takes away from your volicity and has a tendency of causing alot of wild pitches. Do you see  \n  yourself with this problem?\n\nThe leg kick is a tool but if you dont have balance from the kick to the stride your wasting your time .\n\n4. Do you have proper waist rotation going from windup to the stretch this is important. (note) proper hip motion=rotation) if your not balanced going from your turn into the stride this will cause a potential  loss of velocity thats where alot of power pitchers    get this down to tee.\n\nYou say you have a 3qtr arm slot question when you release the ball at what point of your stride are you release what is your arm position .Always release the ball at the top of you stride Balance+  release point = velocity .I hope this gives you some ideas on  where your at or where you need to be at .Please feal free to e-mail question's if you have any .Id be glad to help",5578

So people in south east Asia evolved from Homo erectus in that part of the world, people in western Europe evolved form Neanderthals and people in southern Africa evolved from local erectus populations there.

The Lakota, Ogalla, And Cheyenne call Gressy Grass. There are several reasons that this is important and I will get into it later.\n\nFirst of all the Rank at the time of Gressy Grass was Lt. Colonel, but due to his brevetted Rank in the Civil War was Major General. So if a person were to address him it would be General. It is the same as we refer to President Reagan after he left office, becaue he earned the title. The only way he would have lost the right to be called General is if he was demoted due to an infraction of military law. At the time he was posted here at Fort Lincoln Southwest of Bismarck, Dakota Territory was the need for generals was not as great.\n\nDuring the Civil War he was considered the North premiere Calvary General were he perfected dividing his force and strategy that generations of historians would pan him for the last four decades.\n\nFirst off, General Custer was arrogant, or maybe just overconfident. Although is it really arrogance when you can do what you think you can.\nIf he were as bad a character that the modern day historian claim he was.\n(There is a theory that Reno and Benteen set him up to fail.)\n\nHis orders were vague, he and the seventh Calvary was supposed to meet up with General Terry sometime. He was offered gattlin guns. Some historians think that this might have saved him. There are three problems with this the terrain is incredibly hilly with a lot of coolies making it hard to get them set up. A gattlin gun weighed over a ton and would slow down a Calvary unit (the Calvary Unit of the 19th century were considered to be akin to our special forces today. The Calvary units were quick attack units. Third, black powder had a tendency to jam regularly. I wouldn't have wanted them.\n\nI think that he found the village to soon. The rule of thumb if you could see an indian They KNEW you were there. I will grant you that he didn't listen to his scouts, but the number of warriors in the village I don't think anyone would have comprehended. There is a possibility that he was going to fight a holding action. Trying to hold out tell the three columns of Sheridan and the other Generals. Sheridan and the other two Generals were held up they weren't where they were late because they encountered other Nations on the way.\n\nThe morning of the battle Custer divided his command of about 100 troopers into three commands under Reno and Benteen. (Later in Reno's military career his was court martialed for assaulting his commanding officers daughter). This was so they could surround the village. The last order out from Custer was for Benteen to ""bring packs big village."" He didn't. Reno was surrounded for a time but when one of his sergeants brains were blown out Reno took off running.\n\nHere is the victor's perspective. Months before the Battle Sitting Bull had a vision of soldiers falling into the village. The interesting part of the vision for me was the warning not to take anything from the soldiers or they would loose the war. His warning was headed. (Kinda harkens back to Joshua and the fall of Jericho when he warned them not to take anything, but Achan did and they lost the next battle Joshua 6-7 Makes me ponder what would have happened if the Nations would have heeded the warning).\n\nCrazy Horse was a very formidable General. The terrain really lent a hand to the way the Lakota, Ogalla, and Cheyenne fought. It gave the warriors a lot of cover. The yellow boy Winchester 10 round magazine repeating rifle for close quarter fighting is very formidable against a single shot Spencer carbine. Not including recurve bows. The warriors were trained from an early age to fight one-on-one. The stiff formations of the Calvary didn't work well because the Warrior fought outside of the box.\n\nThe importance o",5659

Much earlier in stage history, when superstition had a less frightening hold on the craft, actors and their followers used a more gracious greeting: ""May you break your leg,"" by which it was meant that the evening's performance would be of such grandeur that the actor would be obliged to break his leg - that is bend his knee - in a deep bow acknowledging the audience's applause.",5661
1,"number of chromatids per chromosome during cell cycle? ; I need to know how many chromatids per chromosome there are for the stages G1, S, G2, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nI think its \nG1=1, \nS=2, \nG2=2, \nprophase=2, \nmetaphase=2,\nanaphase=1\ntelophase=2\n\nAm I correct in my thinking or do I have the whole thing messed up or just some of it? ; In G1, there are 46 chromosomes, EACH CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHROMATID.  You will have two copies of chromosome one (one from mom, the other from dad), two copies of chromosome two, etc.  These pairs are called homologues.  Consequently there are 23 homologous chromosomes in G1 and, again, there is one chromatid per chromosome in this phase.  This gives a total of 46 chromosomes.  You should know that each chromosome is decondensed (not coiled up) at this time. \n\nS phase is the synthesis or replication phase of the cell cycle.  After S phase is complete, the definition of a chromosome changes.  It is now a ""replicated chromosome"" that consists of 2 chromatids (some texts describe these as ""sister chromatids"").  Again, the total number of chromosomes is 46; however, because of the definition change of the S-phase chromosome, each chromosome how includes twice as much DNA due to replication.  After S phase there are two chromatids per chromosome.  These chromosomes are decondensed.\n\nIn G2, there are 46 chromosomes:  2 chromatids per chromosome, decondensed, with the chromosomes existing in homologous pairs.\n\nIn prophase of mitosis, the chromosomes condense to facilitate easy separation into the daughter cells.  Here there are still 2 chromatids per chromosome.\n\nIn metaphase, there are STILL 2 chromatids per chromosome, all smartly arranged at the ""equator"" of the cell, the metaphase plate.\n\nIn anaphase, the replicated chromosomes (i.e., the ""sister chromatids"") are pulled apart.  At the point that they are separated, the definition of a chromosome changes AGAIN, BACK to a single chromatid.  Each daughter cell will receive 46 of these single chromatids and, therefore, will have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs.  The chromosomes are still condensed at this point.\n\nIn telophase, the chromosome situation is exactly the same.  23 homologous PAIRS of chromosomes (46 single chromatids).  The difference here is that the chromosomes are now decondensing.\n\nSummary:  the number of chromatids per chromosome\n\nG1-1\nafter S- 2\nG2-2\nprophase-2\nmetaphase-2\nlate anaphase-1\ntelophase-1",5666

0,"Holy Numbers...? ; Are 11, 7, 9 and holy numbers? ; There is only one Holy Number Known as Divine Proportion or Phi\nPhi ( = 1.618033988749895... ), most often pronounced fi like ""fly,"" is simply an irrational number like pi ( p = 3.14159265358979... ), but one with many unusual mathematical properties.  Unlike pi, which is a transcendental number, phi is the solution to a quadratic equation.\nPhi is the basis for the Golden Section, Ratio or Mean\n\nThe ratio, or proportion, determined by Phi (1.618 ...) was known to the Greeks as the ""dividing a line in the extreme and mean ratio"" and to Renaissance artists as the ""Divine Proportion""  It is also called the Golden Section, Golden Ratio and the Golden Mean.\nCircle with a diameter of 1 and circumference of piPhi, like Pi, is a ratio defined by a geometric construction\n\nJust as pi (p) is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, phi () is simply the ratio of the line segments that result when a line is divided in one very special and unique way.\nDivide a line so that:\n\nSectioning a line to form the Golden Section\n\nthe ratio of the length of the entire line (A)\nto the length of larger line segment (B)\n\nis the same as\n\nthe ratio of the length of the larger line segment (B)\nto the length of the smaller line segment (C).\n \nThis happens only at the point where:\n\nA is 1.618 ... times B and B is 1.618 ... times C.\n\nAlternatively, C is 0.618... of B and B is 0.618... of A.\n\nPhi with an upper case ""P"" is 1.618 0339 887 ..., while phi with a lower case ""p"" is 0.6180339887, the reciprocal of Phi and also Phi minus 1.\n\nWhat makes phi even more unusual is that it can be derived in many ways and shows up in relationships throughout the universe.\nPhi can be derived through:\n\n    *      A numerical series discovered by Leonardo Fibonacci\n    *      Mathematics\n    *      Geometry\n\nPhi appears in:\n\n    *      The proportions of the human body\n    *      The proportions of many other animals\n    *      Plants\n    *      DNA\n    *      The solar system\n    *      Art and architecture\n    *      Music\n    *      Population growth\n    *      The stock market\n    *      The Bible and in theology\nPhi in the Bible: Although perhaps not immediately obvious, phi and the golden section also appear in the Bible.  Also see the Theology page.\nThe Ark of the Covenant is a Golden Rectangle\nIn Exodus 25:10, God commands Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant, in which to hold His Covenant with the Israelites, the Ten Commandments, saying,\n    ""Have them make a chest of acacia wood-\n    two and a half cubits long,\n    a cubit and a half wide,\n    and a cubit and a half high.""\n\nThe ratio of 2.5 to 1.5 is 1.666..., which is as close to phi (1.618 ...) as you can come with such simple numbers and is certainly not visibly different to the eye.  The Ark of the Covenant is thus constructed using the Golden Section, or Divine Proportion.  This ratio is also the same as 5 to 3, numbers from the Fibonacci series.\n\nNote:  A cubit is the measure of the forearm below the elbow.\nNoah's Ark uses a Golden Rectangle\n\nIn Genesis 6:15, God commands Noah to build an ark saying,\n    ""And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.""\n\nThus the end of the ark, at 50 by 30 cubits, is also in the ratio of 5 to 3, or 1.666..., again a close approximation of phi not visibly different to the naked eye.  Noah's ark was built in the same proportion as ten arks of the covenant placed side by side.\n\n\nNoah's Ark\nThe Number 666 is related to Phi\nThe relationship of phi and 666\nRevelation 13:18 says the following:\n    ""This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is a man's number. His number is 666.""\nThis beast, regarded by some as the Anti-Chri",5783

I believe that the 1992 Gary Sheffield rookie card isn't that valuable because Don Russ is not a particularly good series and I believe that 1992 was not a particularly valuable year for rookie cards.

1,"What came first, the chicken or the egg? and why? ; must be the chicken ; In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.\n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.\n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.",5797

It will, however, be radically reshaped by God's creative fire into a planet, or world, much different than it is presently. \n\nJesus' disciples asked him in the Olivet discourse to tell them when the end of the world would come. Actually, they asked: when will be the end of the age? The question involved the end of human history as it had been known to that point. That age about which they questioned the Lord is still going on in our time. \n\nJesus answered by giving a list of prophetic signs that will precede His Second Coming. Christ indicated that the world, as it was then known, and is now known, would end when He returned. Revelation tells us that Jesus' Millennial Kingdom will be the next ""earth age."" \n\nIt will last 1000 years, after which time the Great White Throne judgment will take place, where all lost people of all ages will be judged and sentenced to eternity apart from God. Hell is their final place of residence, from which there will be no escape. \n\nPlanet Earth will then be remade into something more glorious than can be imagined or described by the humanmind, this side of Heaven. Peter, the apostle, through Divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit, gives us just a glimpse of Earth's ultimate destiny: \n\n""But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.""(2 Peter 3: 10-13) God's Word promises: \n\n""One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever."" (Ecclesiastes 1:4) ; well the bible says no man knows the day or the hour.  but you will know the season.  that to me says we may verywell be able to narrow it down to within a few months of when christs second coming will happen.  century score decade year season month and week all come before day and hour we may be even able to tell the WEEK of his coming. the bible say we will know the season.  not we MAY know it says we WILL know. maybe that can be taken literally.\n I can say biblically it must happen between now and the year 2018\n\nthe bible says the generation that sees israel reborn as a nation shall not pass before the second coming israel was reborn as a nation in 1946 the bible defines a generation as 72 years therefore. do the math.\n\nWE ARE IN THE END TIMES PEOPLE!\n\nknow this the US MUST TURN AND COME AGAINST ISRAEL TO FULFILL BIBLICAL PROPHESY.  the bible says ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD will come against israel\n\nwhen will the world end.

The KJV is a horrible translation  that is nowhere near the greek of the Bible. ; In the Hebrew OT, YHWH (still to close to the name of God for Hebrews to feel safe) was frequently replaced with Adonai - Hebrew for ""Lord."" (which is why the Greek NT uses Kurios - ""Lord"").  Your 13th Century monk used the vowled from Adonai with YHWH to form YaHoWaH - but in Ecclesiastical Latin 'J' and 'W' did not exist, so it became Jaehovah.\n\nMajor literary works, like the KJV, do as much to create language as to use the existing language.

A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.  It would be cool to select an item and just start feeding in all those different currencies until the item is paid for, and it spits out change in Dollars or something.  This would make displaying prices difficult, since you are using several currencies to pay for an item, but this would be a valuable thing to have in airports around the world.\n\nInteresting idea.",5917

Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

1,"a fossil is the main or evidence of a living thing explain y fossils r rarely found igneous/metamorphic rocks? ; Scientists belive that very few if any, of the rocks presently on the earth's surface are old enough to have been there since the beginning of the earth approximately four and one half billion years ago.  If that is true, what must have happened to the original rocks? ; I will answer first the easy one. The oldest rocks are found in the pacific plate, the ones near the marianes trench, but their age is not 4.6 bya. Because old rocks return inside the earth through subduction zones. \nRefer to rock cycle.\nNew rocks are produce at the MOR (mid-oceanic ridges) and old ones are consumed at the subduction zones.\nThere are no very old rocks in continental crusts because they were weathered and eroded and brought to seas through rivers.\nNow about fossils. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks forms when sediments accumulates and cemented. Like lakes, and seas. Usually these place occur life. For example a leaf fall from a tree and left at the bottom of the river. Sediments pile over the leaf and thus preserved.\nIf lava piled over a life (like a leaf) the life or existence will burn and thus not preserved.\nFor fossil to occur it must be preserved. Its very difficult to preserved something if heat is involved.",5956

2,"Has anyone had hemorrhoid surgery? ; I heard that if you have the surgery - they can still come back. What's the point in having it done? Is it really worth it? ; Yes, surgery removes the hemorrhoids, but does not prevent from re-appearing again. In most cases they eventually come back. I can try Rue Care Oil that not only treat the hemorrhoids but also helps to straighten the veins and can be used for this purpose after the surgery to help hemorrhoids from re-appearing. Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

My friend Lou found a monitor by the side of the road and brought it over. Wasn't too banged up.  After Ole Ernie gave it the welcome hump, me and Lou got to work. After our work was done, 2 -6 packs, we decided the manly thing was to get that little sucker workin. Since my girlfriend took my oven, along with my abode, we figured WTF? It kinda looked like a microwave. What with the glass front and all. \n\nTrouble was, it wouldn't open. So, I, being a tad smarter that Lou, (he just wanted to kick it out), whacked the back off with my handy tire iron. So now we got it open and throw in a fine lil squirrel I had picked up on Route 22 and plug it un. Nothing. No heat, no nothing.  Ole Ernie (that's my dog) kept trying to pull it out. I was afraid for his safety, so I grabbed a possum out of the freezer and threw it in the back yard. Figuring that would keep him busy for a while. \n\nSo, while Ole Ernie is thrashing about the yard, me and Lou hunker down and jaw out some solution. Along with the help of another 12 pack. Pabst.

6,"How can I consolidate my past debts only? ; I have bad credit due to poor past choices, my basic issue is that I want all my past debts taken care of as soon and as cheap as possible; without having to get my recent bills involved. Some companies want to regulate or buget if you may all the ways you spend you money, and I don't want that. Just want to have my previous debts straightened out. Also, would you know of any other ways to raise your credit score? Thank you ; Snowball technique:\n\n1. Look at all old debts. Rank them from easiest to hardest to pay off based on total owed, minimum payment due, and (tiebreaker) highest interest rates.\n\n2. While making minimum payments to all other debts, pay this one, PLUS as much extra as you can swing- AT LEAST an extra 10%, but the more the better!\n\n3. As soon as this one is paid off, apply all of the payments you WERE making on it to the next debt in line, WHILE still paying the amount on it you were. By this time, you should be paying about twice the minimum so this one will go faster.\n\n4. Repeat for each other debt- the monthly payment will be getting bigger and bigger, paying it off faster and faster.\n\n5. Throw whatever 'windfalls' you can at this also- tax returns, bonuses, etc.\n\nThey say the snowball will get you debt free in the quickest amount of time- even faster than consolidation loans, etc. One nice thing about it is that YOU are in control of it. If you HAVE to hold back some of the extra money once, no big deal.\n\nPS- this is the technique that a lot of 'get out of debt quick, send money for info' schemes tell you to do.",6047

8,"Okay. This is for anyone.? ; Okay. Everybody says I'm pretty, and I get prettier everyday, yadayadayada.  But, I can't except it. Like, I'm not confident in myself. How can I be more confident? ; You're young, right?  I know the feeling, and have it again as an old person.  It's like you cannot respect their judgment, or cannot believe they are telling the truth, when they say you are pretty.  You figure they must have lousy taste, or they want something and are just being flattering, etc.\n\nFact is, it doesn't matter very much what anyone else thinks of your looks compared to what you think when you look in the mirror.  Most young people, especially, exaggerate the importance of their worst feature, and minimize the importance of their best feature.  So, for example, you may have a really classically beautiful face, but you can't appreciate it because you are that dissatisfied with your hair or your figure.  Or the other way around.  If you think an objective view would help, try going to a professional photographer and getting your portrait done.  They see beautiful people all day long, and they also see people who are less than perfect, and know how to maximize the model's potential.\n\nNow go one step further.  Mix that photo with several gathered from the Internet (any that are in jpg format that you can copy with a right click) of people you think are prettier than you.  Create a ""poll"" for someone else (so as not to prejudice the answers) to ask several people to rank order the pictures.  My guess is you will come up higher on the ranking than you think you will, and specifically higher than several pictures you considered to be prettier than yourself.  That's because tastes differ, and you are not able to be objective about yourself.\n\nI know plenty of people will say ""believe in yourself,"" ""love yourself,"" etc.  This is my suggestion on how to gather more-or-less objective evidence for believing in yourself.",6098

Back then more so than now, that meant much more competition (& lower prices,) but also meant that there were lots of compatibility issues with 'tricked out' PC systems.  Different peripheral vendors would do their own thing, & when you put the wrong two parts in the same machine, they would freak out the whole system.  Mac users simply didn't have that problem.  (Every now & then something would crop up, but not NEARLY to the extent that it did for the PC world.)  Still, enough users were looking primarily at the up-front savings, and lots of people did a minimum of customization, anyway.  All that allowed MS-DOS (which evolved to Windows) to build up a larger base of customers, and that momentum built on itself.\n\nIn most ways, Windows has finally (mostly) caught up with Macs in stability & usability.  And, Macs aren't as much more expensive than PCs as they used to be, either.  But, you won't see me giving up my Macs!  :)\n\nYou are not making a poor decision!  Go for it!",6165
3,"I have a report on to kill a mokingbird (see below for details)? ; I have a report on Mrs. Dubose's characteristics in To Kill a Mockingbird. Can someone give me all the traits and details? It is due tommorow \n\nPLEASE HELP ; summary:\n\nScout (Jean Louise) Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama county of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris (Dill), who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside in daylight.\n\nScout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ black cook, takes them to the local black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAtticus’s sister, Alexandria, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem, Dill, and Scout, who snuck out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death (though it might be that he tried to escape so he could get shot deliberately because he wanted to die looking like a hero. However, in the book, it is said that he could've escaped if he had two good arms instead of one). In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a halloween pageant at their school. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children. Atticus at first believes that Jem fatally stabbed Mr. Ewell in the struggle. ",6166

9,"Parrot talk!  Who taught some- that Americans won't do menial labor? ; Where does this idea come from? Many are maids, farm workers, construction, lawn-its not just the people from Mexico. A guest work pass is fine if companies need more. It would would not drain our system (Aid, schools,housing on them)We need to help the people in our own nation-who need Health-food-housing- its millions (look on web).It seems many do not care about them-so they want them to suffer because of aid to others-what kind of Justice is that? And that excuse is very old. Everyone feels for the poor-but we don't trample on others-so others can get more. Hello- there is not enough money for everyone-it is not an endless pot. If those who want to help others-start a fund. I am not going to see others hurt in your so called humanity efforts that effect other here already. And it does effect them! Educate yourself and quit repeating mindless words. ; The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea",6173

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

6,"I think this government grant program is worth the time? ; but do you?\n  http://www.swapselltrade.com/govgrants.htm ; It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.",6246

9,"Opinions about child support? ; I think child support, in most cases, is BS. I am speaking as a mother of one and do not get child support.My sons father has him half the time and provides everything he needs when he is with him. My husband on the other hand has a son and the mother took him and moved away because he didn't want to be with her.My husband has ALWAYS taken care of his son.He gave her money voluntarily and still paid for stuff on the side for him. Now she filed child support and has been awarded $400 a month for one child! how rediculous is that. If child support is suppose to be fair then they are telling us it takes $800 a month to take care of this child? Thats BS! Unless your childhas special needs or is ill it does not take even 400 a month to take care of one child. She has no rent cause she lives with her dad and my husband paid for both cars she has. Why do they have these men solely paying for these kids? What is the mothers responsibility? What does she pay for? ; child support is not a magical number that the judge pulls out of his butt.  child support is based on the income of the mother, the income of the father etc.  the state has a chart and depending on what the father makes a figure is computed. in other words x+y=z.  unfortunately i see alot of cases come through my court where the father is the one 99% of the time paying child support.  and even worse the state does not factor in if the father has a mortgage, utilities, food expenses etc.  it sucks big!  i get so angry sometimes in court, but we have to maintain our proffessionalism.  and as soon as these women find out that the father has obtained a second job, they petition the court for more money because he has more income.  I had a case last week that was just absolutely insane.  the man was a capt. in the army and he was ordered to pay alimony, child support, and maintain the mortgage on the house that she got during the divorce and he no longer resides in.  in the end with all the money he was paying out to her, she ended up receiving more of his income than he did.  I have even had many men blatently tell the judge that they would rather go to jail than to pay.  I think in regards to reaching what amount he or she should pay, the state should take into considering what he/she pays out in living expenses and then factor child support. unfortunately the state feels that if you have to live under a bridge they don't care as long as they pay.  you can always repetition the court and present your case and see if they will lower his support amount.",6256

Even that isn't going to be so easy. For example, it is clear that if we write\nt_k (x)=sum p_nk x^n,\nthen\na_n=sum p_nk  c_k.\n\nNotice that even a_0 will depend on infinitely many c_k (since t_k(0)=p_0k  is non-zero for all even k).\n\nAdded:\nIt looks like\na_0 = sum (-1)^k c_{2k}.\nThere is a recurrence relation among the p_nk which you might be able to exploit to get formulas for the other a_k. I'll think about it a bit more.\n\nAdded:\nOK. In an e-mail you suggested doing the integrals for the expnasions of x^alpha. Here's a suggestion:\nYou want to evaluate \nint_-1^1 x^n t_k(x)/sqrt(1-x^2) dx.\nif you let x=cos(A), then t_k(x)=cos(kA), so the integral transforms into\nint_-pi/2^pi/2 cos^n(A) cos(kA) dA.\nIf you now write this in terms of complex exponentials and expand by the binomial theorem, several terms will zero out.

We're not yet ready to marry so we can't get a fiance  visa, he'd love to find work here and stay though. ; Under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) citizens of certain countries can come here for upto 90 days without getting a visa.  They can still get other visas such as the B1/B2 visa which would allow them to stay up to 6 months.\n\nThe advantage of the VWP is that they just need a machine readable passport and a return ticket and a good story to tell the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer (if he askes).\n\nThe disadvantages of a VWP are that the visitor must leave within 90 days or they can be barred from using it in the future (make SURE that the green form is turned into the airline on his departure).\n\nThe main disadvantage is that the visitor signs away (waives) all recourse.  The CBP officer at the port of arrival can ""just say no"" and back on the plane the visitor goes without recourse.  Also a VWP does not allow adjustment of status.  For example, you two find true love and get married, too bad, back he goes!\n\nIf he came in under a B1/B2 (or other visas) or even as an Entry Without Inspection EWI (pronounced Eee Wee) he can adjust status in some circumstances.\n\nIf he works at all, even for tips at a diner, he is ""out of status"" and is the easiest illegal to process.

Anyways, when it comes to sex, I'm more shy and he... let's just say he watches a lot a porn... so he wants to alway stry out these kinky things.  A lot of the time, it just goes straight against my character (not morals..kind.. how I act) and so I can never seem to feel comfortable pretending to be something I'm not.  I'm not totally against the idea, but I always tell him ""wait until we are older when we actually need that spark... ect"" and that I am not comfortable doing it, but he still demands it.  He even puts up certain dates for me to do it now... He will say ""Okay you haven't done ""x"" in a while, so do it by next week"".  It's really frustrating because I feel like I can't please him, and I kind of feel selfish for not doing what he wants (because trust me.. he gives me more than enough ""lovin"").  What should I do to feel more comfortable?? ; Actually, my dear, there is nothing that ""you"" should do...he is the one with the ""issue"". Sex is supposed to be fun, sex is supposed to be caring, sex is supposed to be sacred(and I mean doing things together that bring you closer, not thinking like this). I am frankly outraged that your boyfriend is acting...aherm...like such a jerk. \nNow don't get me wrong, I love getting ""kinky""...but my husband, not so much; not because he is prudish, or because he doesn't want to please me, but because he is not comfortable. You are 18, you should be having a good time, not worring about whether or not you're getting enough ""kink"" into your relationship with your apparently very immature boyfriend. \nAnd he is demanding that you do things...BAH...that is loathsome to me...it is one thing to request or suggest...maybe even ""dabble"" in the kinky to see if you both enjoy it...but if you don't enjoy it; that's it, game over...if you wish to try it again, it will be on your terms, not his...and watching a lot of porn is not an excuse.\nLet me give you the perfect example, and hopefully you'll see my point...I am very into bondage, my husband is more than happy to ""dish it"" but not much for taking it...so okay, I can work with that. I let my inner dominatrix out in other ways; but anyway, one nite he felt like exploring, so I tied him up. He did not like it, not one bit and kinky things usually had to deal with trust...so I let it go. A couple of nites later, he was willing to try it again, and so on and so forth. \nSo from my example hopefully you can see that what your boyfriend is doing is not ""adult""; it is the utmost in immaturity and a complete lack of understanding. Talk to him, frankly tell him I said so, a kinky woman that understands the rules in the adult playground...and if he doesn't get it; dump him. There are more fish in the sea than him...and probably better ones (if you know what I mean) than him as well. If you don't play by the rules, you're going to get flown off of the merry-go-round, and it's just that simple honey...so put on your big girl boots and lay down the rules for his little games...and if he breaks 'em; he's out...and somebody new can play ""red-rover"" with you.",6301

0,"Jesus is lord who can dispute it ??? ; why the father of lies thats who. ; The Requirements for the Messiah and Christian Contradictions.\n\nA. Here is just a brief list of some of the requirements for the Messiah:\n\n(1) He must be Jewish (see Deut. 17:15; Numb. 24:17);\n(2) He must be descended from Judah (Gen. 49:10) and Solomon (numerous places, but see I Chron 22:9-10);\n(3) With the coming of the Messiah will be the physical ingathering of Judah from the four corners of the earth (Isa. 11:12, 27:12-13);\n(4) Also with coming of the Messiah will be the reestablishment of the Holy Temple (Micah 4:1);\n(5) In addition the Messianic age will be one of world-wide peace (Isa. 2:4, 11:6, Micah 4:3); and, finally,\n(6) In the Messianic age the entire world will believe in G-d (Isa. 11:9, 40:5; Zephaniah 3:9).\n\nB. Satisfying the Criteria -- the Geneology Problem\n\nEven if Christians could establish that (a) Jesus existed and (b) Jesus was Jewish, they would have trouble proving that (c) Jesus was descended from Judah and Solomon. Both of the detailed geneologies in Matthew and Luke trace Joseph's lineage to King David, albeit differently since Matt. 1:16 says that a fellow named Jacob was Jospeph's father, and Luke 3:23 tells us that Joseph was the son of Eli. (It seems that that family had a lot of problems determining fatherhood.) But these geneologies are bogus because Matthew tells us that Joseph wasn't the father of Jesus, but Mary was still a virgin even after he was conceived through the ""Holy Spirit""! Matt. 1:18. Since we know that geneology runs from the father (Numbers 1:18; 2:2), Jesus cannot claim descendency from Judah.\n\nC. No Messianic Era.\n\nEven still, Christians still have a problem because they still can't establish points 3, 4, 5, or 6 in paragraph A, above. Saying that those events will happen in a Second coming is circular at best and contradicts Revelations 22:20 (""Yes, I am coming quickly."")\n\n\n  \nAbuse and Misquotes of the Hebrew Bible\n\nA. Isaiah 53. Who Was the ""Suffering Servant""?\n\nMissionaries commonly Isaiah 53 as a proof text that the Messiah will suffer for the people's sins. E.g.:\n\n""(3)He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with sickness; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not:\n(4)Surely he has borne our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted:\n(5)But he was wounded because of our transgressions, he was bruised because of our iniquities; his sufferings were that we might have peace; and by his injury we are healed:\n(6)All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all:\n(7)He was oppressed, but he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep, that is dumb before its shearers, he did not open his mouth:\n(8)By oppression and false judgment was he taken away; and of his generation who considered? For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people:\n(9)And they made his grave among the wicked, and his tomb among the rich; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth:""\n\nOn its face it sounds convincing in retrospect knowing what we know about Jesus from the NT only. But, who is the ""he"" referred to in the verses? Let's trace it back a few lines to the previous chapter (52), where the discussion of what ""he"" will do begins. At 52:13 it appears to begin with ""Behold, my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.""\n\nOK, so now we know that ""he"" is G-d's ""servant."" But who is G-d's ""servant""? Let's trace our steps a little further. In Isaiah 41:8 the question is answered: ""But Israel is my servant."" The next line, Isaiah 41:9, adds some more: ""You are ",6366

9,"What causes people to commit a crime? ; I'm wanting to know because i have to do a speech for school on crime rates and i was just wondering why a person would commit a crime. Any sort of crime in my books is wrong no matter what your reason is. ; It can be a combination of things, and in most real cases it is.  Poverty, upbringing, financial status, social status, can all have a push or pull when some one is deciding on commiting a crime.  In most crimes most people have a well structured plan of what they were going to do, which means that it wasn't some spur of the moment thing.  For example I did a case studie on Drug related crimes: selling, production and so forth.  Over 40 percent of the criminals admited that it was easier for them to sell and produce drugs than it was to actually go and get a paying job.  Now that can be considerd a social upbringin or classification.  \n\nFor some people crime is a way of life, Little Rock Arkansas has the highest rate of gang killings in the US Higher than LA, Okland, and New York.  There was a documentary that showed that little kids were raised up in gangs, hanging round drugs, sex, and crime.  It wasn't a case of these children choosing to joing the Crypts of the Bloods it was that they were raised in the enviorment.  Additionaly to the gang enviorment these children were raised in poverty, the social sturcture was messed up from the beginning weather it was parenting, education, and so on.  \n\nThen you have those that do it for the thrill of doing it.  Take for example kids killing for fun.  I forgot what show it was (was on A&E) but was over kids killing other kids for fun. 4 out of the 5 killers that were intervied said they wanted to know what it felt like to kill.  Now most of these kids were brought up living the american dream: mom, dad, house, minvan, dog, but yet these kids wanted to kill.  Now dose the killings that these kids in any way diffierent from the killing of those raised in gangs, no they were killing, but their social, education, and other aspects were worlds apart.\n\nso in short its can be alot of things that will push a person to commit a crime, weather it be petty thieving to premptive murder.",6415

I need a free full antivirus or antispyware because i am infested with the Trojan virus i scanned the computer with the NOD32,Adware-SE and Spyware Blaster but no succes.When i start the windos explorer i dont see my default page, i see a website safety security or something like that and he told me that i have a virus and i have files exposed on the internet such as System32,Program files and other files.They said that i need some update or patch but it doesnt work yesterday i tried to download the update but it says that Page cannot be displayed. what should i do i need to get this virus out of my computer but how? ; First of all, one of the easiest wey to stop online attacks is, STOP USING INTERNET EXPLORER. Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

5,"why don't rugby players sustain injuries like footballers.? ; In the world cup the game is stopped every ten minutes due to somebody rolling around in agony on the ground,but in Rugby, \nplayers have broken noses and teeth missing but rarely do you see a match stopped. ; Football by the very nature of the game concentrates mainly on the feet - with the speed and standard of football increased the tackles and contact to the lower part of the body will be quite hard & frequent. With rugby on the other hand most of the contact will be experienced in the upper body - the training builds up the upper body to take the hits. Probably since there is more 'flesh' (muscle & bulk) on the upper body the degree & frequency of contact that can be sustained would be greater than around the ankles & shins. \nThe rolling around bit by the footbal players is probably due to the fact that in todays football/soccer games it is that hard to score a goal due to the high level of skill, any advantage gained will be a bonus.\nWith rugby union now being a fully professional sport, increased speed & fitness combined with the large number of games being played I think injuries will be more common place. What you will notice is that due to the reasons just mentioned before, the retirement age of the rugby players will decrease, remember Paul Rendel 'The Judge' played international rugby for England in the 1980's at the age of 36 - it will be unlikely that players will represent their country at an international level at such an age in future.",6526

You should divide this problem into 3 intervals:\n\n1) 150 MPH for first 50 miles\n2) 125 MPH for 2 minutes\n3) 150 MPH for reaminder of trip\n\nFor interval 1, we need to caclulate the time taken to travel 50 miles:\n\n(50 miles)(1 hour / 150 miles) = 1/3 hour = 20 min\n\nFor interval 2, we needed to calculate the distance traveled in order to solve for interval 3:\n\n(125 miles / 1 hour)(2/60 hour) = 25/6 miles\n\nNow, we can find the # of miles for interval 3:\n\n# miles = 200 - (50 + 25/6) = 875/6 miles \n\nNow we can find the time needed to travel this distance:\n\n(875/6 miles)(1 hour / 150 miles) = 35/36 hour (around58 min)\n\n---------\n\nTo find average speed, you need to take [total distance/ time].  therefore,\n\navg. speed = [200 miles]/[(1/3) + (1/30) + (35/36) hr] ------->\n\n149.38 miles per hour\n\n------------\n\nHope this helps",6533

Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.",6548

1,"Ice Skaters? ; Two ice-skaters stand next to each other on the ice.  One skater, with a mass of 80 kg, pushes the other, who has a mass of only 50 hg.  If the pushed skater moves at 4m/s, what is the speed of the heavier skater? ; Hmmm. Lessee... two skaters on slick ice. One, mass 80 kg, pushes the other and, according to Newton, is simultaneously pushed back in the opposite direction while the other, mass 50 kg, goes flying off across the ice at 4 m/s. This is a closed system, right? So where did that 200 kilogram meters per second of momentum imparted to the lighter skater come from? Yikes! Could the heavier skater have acquired the SAME momentum in the opposite direction? Is it possible that, after all this time since Newton, momentum is STILL conserved? Does MV = mv, where M is the mass of the heavier skater, V the velocity of the heavier skater, m the mass of the lighter skater, and v the velocity of the lighter skater? Does (80) V = (50) (4)? Does V = 2.5 meters per second? Nah! Lard butt's extra mass caused their skates to dig into the ice, and created enough friction to slow them down to 0.0025 meters per second... probably.",6598

1,"What is H.E.P. and how does it differ from Particle Physics? ; What does a High Energy Physicist do and how does it differ from a Particle Physicist? And are the only two places they can work is in a University or a Particle Accelerator? ; Particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them. It is also called ""high energy physics"", because many elementary particles do not occur under normal circumstances in nature, but can be created and detected during energetic collisions of other particles, as is done in particle accelerators.\n\nResearch work certainly requires a particle accelerator, which can be found in both university and private environments. (see link for lists).  There is also a huge body of work in public policy, to expand the research arena, and theory, devising potential projects for the researchers.\n\nSo, H.E.P (high energy physics) and particle physics are essentially the same thing.  A physicist specializing in this area can work in areas other than universities and particle accelerators.\n\nGreat Question!  I learned something new!!",6628
5,"Deer sheds? ; Why do deer shed their antlers, and why is it at only a certain time frame of the year? ; Why do deer shed their antlers?\nDeer shed their antlers annually as a prelude to the regeneration, or re-growth, of new ones.\n\nThe entire shedding process takes a mere two to three weeks to complete, and the re-growth phase takes place over the summer. The docile male deer that, with the exception of the male and the female reindeer, solely sports antlers, sheds them between January and April, after the autumn mating season draws to a close. He can do without antlers at this time, because his need for them in prior months, to attract and to impress females for his harem of mates, and to fight with his competitors for the females' affections, no longer exists.\n\nThe antlers themselves differ from the hollow horns of cattle, in that they comprise solid bone tissue with a honey combed structure. Pedicles, or knobby, skin-covered nubs protruding from the skull, support the deer's antlers, or points, which range in number from one shaft to eleven branches. The pedicles are a permanent fixture on the deer's forehead, and are the point from which the antlers annually break off.\n\nDuring the first year the pedicles appear on the young deer's forehead. The following year, the youngster sprouts straight, spike- like shafts, and in the third year, the first branch appears. In successive years, as the deer matures, his antlers lengthen and, in most species, he acquires additional branches. One can actually determine the age of the deer from the number of branches on his antlers, as their number increases with age.\n\n During the growth phase of the bony antlers, they are covered with a sensitive skin referred to as ""velvet,"" which is filled with blood vessels that feed the antlers the vitamins and the minerals necessary to build up the bone, and to promote normal antler growth. Antler growth spans two to four months, after which time the velvet is no longer needed, and a ring, which effectively serves as a shutoff valve, forms at the base of the antlers and cuts off the blood supply to the velvet. As a result, the velvet withers, dries up, and falls off, often assisted by the deer, which rubs his antlers against tree bark. The antler regeneration is complete, and the shedding cycle will resume once mating season in the fall concludes.",6629

Can they do this ; If the boy is under age and the father is a registered sex offender, he could be, based on the law where the boy is located.  Also, if his parole states that he must stay away from children, the answer is a definite yes, if the boy is underage.\n\nAnother issue is in the boy's mother got a restraining order against the father for herself or the boy or it is part of the divorce decree that he stay away from the mother or the boy.  If either is true, the answer is again, a definite yes.\n\nAs the boy is an adult, does the boy have a restraining order against the father?

Is this still for today's Christians or was it just for the early church congregations.  Did the 'gifts of the Spirit' terminate somewhere in history or are they still appropriate today?  If they did terminate, when did that happen and why? ; Jesus said, these things and more will you do, because I go to the Father. . .there was no statute of limitations.  In fact, the Bible says spirituality will increase in end times.  Yes, it's valid for today.  The guidelines in Corinthians are important safeguards, but it doesn't do away with the reality of the gifts.",6674

0,"Oldest Person in the bible? ; I meen really not Methuselah. \n\nPeople say Methuselah was the longest-lived man, with a specified age, in Biblical history.

If you are eating ANY kind of fatty foods, you are simply pouring gasoline on that fire.  Also, have they given you any other tests such as an ERCP, Endoscope, Colonoscopy, Upper GI, Lower GI or maybe even an MRI?  I just recently spent 14 days in the hospital getting regular doses of pain and nausea medication and had all of these test ran.  Luckily I do not have Pancreatitis, but I do have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is also diet related (lack of fiber usually); also there is a disease known as Crones Disease that have the same type of symptoms.

0,"Bored = Afraid of Hindus or Buddhists? ; I dont fear any people of faith.  Spirituality, like someone said is entirely different.  Spiritual people's beliefs, from what ive encountered, are overwhelmingly positive and personal, as opposed to half positive, sometimes disgustingly negative.  Buddhists i think have far more sensible and positive beliefs than christians, i think eastern 'religions' are intriguing and to be learned from.  I cant say that i dont like all christians, i dont know them all, i dont like what they believe.  Dont pray for me, instead smoke a blunt for me, at least do something that accomplishes something.  If anyone cares, my belief system is very simple;  if there is a god, he will not punish me or anyone else for that matter in any way.  Beyond that big IF, i believe that i dont know, and i wont pretend to.  But i will constantly question, and never accept blindly the assertions of people who know just as little as i do.  Religion WISHES to impose its VERY conservative positions into everyones life. ; For thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry. God is not like a father in a patriarchal society, who has His favorite children to whom He communicates. This idea seems rather archaic and crude. Hinduism believes in behavior than belief and  experience over authority. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, Prophetic religion is severe, militant, uncompromising, intolerant, while mystic religions are renouncing, and peaceful. \n\nThere is no need to be afraid of world's most tolerant, religion wich never persecuted nor attcked any country in name of religion .\n\nBored?? The vast collection of Hidu philosophy is fascinating and colourfull. No one can ever be bored . \n\nIn fact it will improve your understanding of mysticism even in christianity.It is a collection of wisdom of innemerable sages are missing out a great deal.\n\nThe Hindu religious system can be divided into two major systems. The Orthodox system (called astika in Sanskrit) accepts the authority of the Vedas.\n\n1. Sankhya - founder Sage Kapila\n2. Yoga  -  Sage Patanjali\n3. Mimamsa  - Sage Vyasa / Sage Jaimini\n4. Vedanta  - Shankaracharya, Ramanuja/Chaitanya/ Madhava/Vallabha\n5. Nyaya  - Sage Gautama (not Buddha)\n6. Vaisheshika - Sage Kanda\n\nThe Heterdox (Nastika) system rejects the authority of the Vedas. This system includes Carvaka (materialism), Jainism, and Buddhism. The Carvaka system denies existence of the individual self(atman) apart from the body and rejects the notion of moksha (salvation) for the atman\n\nWisdom of Geeta is a class apart.\n\nHinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of worship. When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. For it is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. Thus, it becomes a kind of social idolatry. Highly individualistic, Hindus have always resisted any regimentation of thought.\n\nRegarding mothermulesmeals' post:\n\n I am glad I am not one of her friends at whom she is  always preaching Jesus  !!! It only shows their maturity and her own childish ignorance.\n\nReally she takes advantage of their being tolerance in it. She seems to be blissfully ignorant how irritating it is. Or may be she does not care about it in her zeal.\n\nHow would she feel if they start telling her how immature, egoistic and narrow , is the idea that God asked everyone to follow Jesus !\n\nGod does not his favourite children. Religion is an experience. To think that any human being or institution has the monopoly of God's truth is to commit the sin of pride.",6701
6,"What are some good credit cards for credit repair that AREN'T scams? ; I've never had a credit card (although my credit sucks) and heard they're a great way to repair credit. Any tips? ; First all, if you're trying to repair your credit, the APR shouldn't matter because if you're really committed you will pay off all bills in full every month!\n\nTry the credit cards offered by your bank first. Banks have a soft-spot for their customers and that can be a positive factor in their credit approval.\n\nNext, look at cards offered by Chase, CapitalOne or Citibank.  These are reputable company.\n\nOrchard Bank should never be a choice if you're building credit. In my opinion, their lending practices border on predatory. Fees are outrageous, and they are not very good at disclosing hidden ones.\n\nIf your credit is as bad as your say, be prepared.  \n    You may be denied.   \n    You may be offered a secured credit card.\n    You may be offered a credit card with a higher rate.  \n\nIf you're denied for credit, don't keep trying. Wait for at least 6 months before you try again. When you apply for a credit card, the lender will get your credit report. The more you apply for credit, the lower your score can get and less like you are to be approved for credit.\n\nVicious cycle, right?\n\nIf the credit card has a high APR, consider accepting the card.  The high APR will only affect you if you carry a balance at the end of each statement cycle.  BUT pay off everything when the bill comes. \n\nIf you do this, you won't see your credit improve right away.  It may takes anywhere from 1-7 years to repair your credit.\n\nIf you were offered a secured credit card, think twice. Lenders don't just look at your credit score or whether you have a good repayment history. They also look at the type of credit lines you have.",6702

Do you have any suggestions that I could pass along? The boys are only five and six. ; Try taking the advice given here. Be prepared to march down to the school a lot to try to get this taken care of. Your grandkids CAN learn! Then, if none of that works, consider homeschooling, or have the parents consider homeschooling, whichever is more appropriate. Like some of these teachers said, they are trained to educate regular student, not special children. I know a boy with FAS and a myriad of other diagnoses, and when he was eight years old, he snuck out of a locked campus and was halfway home before his grandma was called and told he was missing. He had walked about five miles. Homeschooling gives you the advantage of knowing your grandson's individual problems. There are so many different types of problems going on in a special ed class, that I don't blame the teacher for being overwhelmed. Most special ed kids excel once they start being taught at home because they are in an environment they know, with loving caregivers who understand the complexities of their own disorders, and are able to work at their own pace. There's no distractions like there are in a classroom. It just seems to work. There are several place you can turn to to learn about homeschooling kids with special needs. Check yahoo groups, there's a lot. I'm on HS-Plus, and it's a really good group. Lots of different disorders being dealt with, FAE/FAS is a big one, so you'd get lots of help.

Has anybody any knowledge in this area? ; This is from Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders - 3rd ed. (2001):   \n\nBupropion, a ""second generation"" antidepressant, has also been examined for a possible role in cocaine pharmacotherapy. In an open pilot study, treatment with bupropion reduced cocaine use (Margolin et al. 1991) and attenuated several cocaine-induced positive subjective ratings during laboratory cocaine administration (Singha et al. 1997). However, a multisite placebo-controlled study failed to show that bupropion was more efficacious than placebo in reducing cocaine's effects (Margolin et al. 1995b). \n\nBasically, it's saying that Wellbutrin has been administered along with cocaine, but it's not clear that it actually helps with cocaine addiction.  It sounds like you're okay to take it, but if you don't usually use cocaine, why not wait a day before starting the bupropion, just to be sure?",6747

1,"Did time begin with the so called ""Big Bang"",  or did the Big Bang occur at some point in time? ; I'm just facinated with the concept of time especially it's beginning and end.  Do you think time can be thought of in terms of a straight line or is it a circle.  No beginning and no end. ; By definition, the big-bang is the beginning of the known universe; that is to say: everything that can be known is from after the big-bang. And so, implicitly your question is answered – time started with the big-bang, simply because we can not find any proof of it’s existence before. (I know, it is a little confusing.)\n\nAs to time’s linearity –\nI’ll start with a different difficult concept – infinity. \nDraw a square grid. Stretch it to infinity. ALL of its edges are now at infinity. In any direction you choose to move, you will eventually reach infinity. The same word describes your location no matter where you are. If all these places are denoted by one word-symbol-number, than all these places are one!\nGauss was first to visualize this: take your infinite grid and wrap it around a sphere with a radius of one that rests at its origin. The point (0,0) would become a southern pole, the point we called infinity would become the northern pole. \nAny infinite straight line would become a circle when drawn on this sphere grid. \n\nNow I’ll give you back your question: what do you think is the shape of the time line?",6764

Exercising WHILE you have the cramps only makes them worse-- trust me, I had that problem when I was 18 (at first the doc thought it might be a cyst, but then I just started working out all the time because of a school activity, and I am 21 now, still work out regularly, haven't had them since).  And you said cheaply-- exercise is free!\n\nBut speaking of cysts, it could be one of those.  My friend's sister had killer cramps, and it turned out that a cyst was the reason.

A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.  My preference is the Apollo bio fins although there are many excellent choices out there.\n\nIn terms of torch, I think that depends on your application.  I like the Ikelite PCA, the UK SL4 and the small UK pocket light.  These would work for tropical night diving.  Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.  I really like the scubapros but there are *many* great choices.  Rodale's Scuba Diving does do periodic gear reviews that are worth a look.\n\nWetsuit is alll about two things:  a) correct thickness for the water temp and your cold tolerance; and b) fit.\n\nWhat about a bc?",6770

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

1,"Does the full moon affect the speed of the earth's rotation? ; Can the moon's effect on gravity and tides vary or affect the speed of the earth's rotation i.e. speed it up/slow it down ever so slightly during monthly moon phases? If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time.

You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.

But they wont mean anything to you, because you are now a Christian, and no longer a Jew, IF you ever were one......\n----------\nObviously, for a ""Jewish man,"" you know little of the Bible or of Judaism or of Gd.\n\nPLEASE look at the following::\nhttp://WhatJewsBelieve.org\nhttp://Convert.org \n\nThe basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says, and so Real Jews cannot believe in Jesus at all.\n\nThe Christian understanding is that the Messiah, Jesus, died for the sins of the people. The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.\n\nBut we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another. In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this:\n\nDeuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not \nbe put to death for the children, neither \nshall the children be put to death for\nthe fathers: \nevery man shall be put to death for his \nown sin (eesh b’chet-o yumatu).\n\nIn Exodus 32:30-35, Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people. To be written out of Gd's book, means to be written out of the Book of Life, which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People. Gd's response is No, it does not work that way, each man dies for his own sin:\n\nExodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the \nmorrow, that Moses said unto the people, \nYe have sinned a great sin: and now I will \ngo up unto the Etrnl; perhaps I shall make \nan atonement for your sin. And Moses \nreturned unto the Etrnl, and said, Oh, \nthis people have sinned a great sin, and \nhave made them gods of gold. Yet now, if \nthou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, \nblot me, I pray thee, out of thy book \nwhich thou hast written. And the Etrnl \nsaid unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned \nagainst me, him will I blot out of my \nbook. \n\nThe whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea, that no one can die for someone else's sin. Further, this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd will forgive us.\n\nSo, the Bible is clear, no one can die for the sins of another, and this means that Jesus cannot die for anyone else's sins.\n\nChristians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin, that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins, and go to hell, except for the sacrifice of Jesus.\n\nThis, too, is UnBiblical. The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus. But it is in Leviticus itself, in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices, that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins. Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal. Was forgiveness then, to be only for the rich? No, because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour, which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice, and Gd forgave them!\n\nLeviticus 5:11-13; But if he be not able to \nbring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, \nthen he that sinned shall bring for his \noffering the tenth part of an ephah of fine \nflour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil \nupon it, neither shall he put any \nfrankincense thereon: for it is a sin \noffering.\n\nFurthermore, read the Book of Jonah. In Jonah, the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd. They fast, they pray for forgiveness, and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd forgave them! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur, we fast, we pray for forgiveness, and, h",6811

If you really want to be with her romantically, you need to sit down with her and make definitive, clear statements about everything.

6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds. Also, be sure to balance this investment with some equity (stock) investments to give you diversification. Good luck!",6852

The stated fact that she is a highly valued employee would suggest that salvaging her is the direction to take, sometimes forgiveness can be applied in the secular world and people who are afforded second chances often go on to become role models. The fact that she has confessed should also be considered in this argument, as this can be deemed as remorse for these actions and remorse is generally an indication that the offence will not be committed again.

Credit also to Beth Tweddle as she has something no-one can ever take away from her - Britain's first ever world champion in her sport.  Top marks also to Nicole Cooke for overcoming horrendous injuries when she was knocked off her bike whilst training and going on to win the year-long World Cup.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions?? ; A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.

For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.  No sugar, white bread, rice, fast food, processed foods, etc.  Spread them out between 6 meals a day, every 2.5 hours, this means every meal will have to be 430 calories, not bad when you break it up.  Track your calories on Fitday.com and read fitness forums.  here's a good one:  introduce yourself and tell them ""rasberryco"" referred you :)  Good luck\n\nFitday.com\nhttp://z13.invisionfree.com/ExtremePhysique/index.php?",6900

Do yall believe that America will be the first nation to create spacecrafts able to be used for military purposes? and if not who? ; Well, some would say we're already there.  Any military spacecraft will be around for awhile  before we hear about it. The ""aurora"" project is said by many to be a military project to develope a hypersonic air/space craft.  Some evidence exists to support the theory. \n  In areas around the groom lake test facility.

0,"English only? ; Don't you think all store signs in the U.S. should be in English only?   I was driving around town and couldn't read half the signs because they were in Korean. ; Are you saying that Korean grocery stores should not be allowed to advertise Korean foods to Korean customers (who are most likely the only ones who will be buying them) in Korean? So you're suggesting that they be forced to spell out the words phonetically in English and hope that Koreans will know what the made-up English spelling means? What kind of sense does that make?\n\nHave people completely lost their minds? Why is all of this hatred suddently being directed at anyone and everyone who dares to display knowledge of any language besides English in the United States? What are immigrants supposed to do, have a labotomy in order to delete their native tongue and any memory of their native land or culture so that Americans will not be submitted to hearing other languages besides English under any circumstances whatsoever?\n\nI can't believe how freaking ignorant and xenophobic people are becoming. If you're pissed off about illegal immigration, fine, do something about it: start fining companies that hire illegals huge fines, and the illegal job market will dry up. If you're worried that people don't understand English and won't be able to find a job, then offer free or low-cost English classes at various times and on various days in neighbordhoods where there are lots of immigrants. But stop throwing fits about the fact that some people are able to communicate in TWO languages and choose the language in which they communicate at any point in time based on the context. \n\nGeez...Is it ridiculous to ask for a LITTLE tolerance and common sense?\n\nTO Bluffmike: Dude, your argument makes no sense. So you're saying that in order to avoid becoming like the Chinese, who were able to employ xenophobic, intolerant troops to squelch liberty by killing the protesting Hans, whom they disliked, we should become more intolerant and xenophobic. Does that not seem a little contradictory to you? No, no, no, if we want to avoid the path of the Chinese, we need to encourage TOLERANCE not intolerance.\n\nTo Concerned: Actually, plenty of Americans do move to China and expect to be spoken to in English. My ex-husband travels there all the time and may be transferred there next year. He speaks very little Chinese. Luckily, all the business people in China speak English, so when he's around, they speak English. They would make him an immigrant who doesn't speak the language, dear.\n\nAre you aware that something like 50% of the business in non-English speaking countries in Europe is conducted in English? That's because they're intelligent enough to realize that it's in their best interest to be multilingual. The more languages you speak, the more business you can do with monolinguals, and the more money you make. It's the way of the whole freakin' world. Only citizens of the U.S. seem to think that they should never be forced to speak, or even listen to, another language. Talk about being rude!\n\nJust out of curiosity: when you travel to Europe or Asia on business and are talking to American co-workers, what language do you speak in? English? Then by your own rules, you're being rude. Looks a little stupid when you put the shoe on the other foot, doesn't it?\n\nTO Concerned, again: Incidentally, you misspelled ""illiterate"" and ""their"" in a sentence accusing people of being illiterate in their own language. Nice job.",6915

After about 10 minutes my left ankle has some discomfort, slight pain. Even so, I've just continued on with my 40 minute workout. Is this due to using different muscles? Will it go away in time? Thanks! ; It depends on whats causing the pain. I've learned from experience that some of these machines cause you to stand in unnatural positions. Causing your alignment to be off balance. You are probably using your ankle in a position that is not right for you. Think about it... when your walking or running you dont stand that wide. Could be the shoes. Make sure u have good support. If you are small framed or shorter typed this positioning could definitely be the case.Sounds like your position on the machine is off so keep repositioning yourself on it and see if it continues.

My 10 month old daughter passed away from SIDS on May 2, 2006.  I found that involving myself with SIDS related events, and trying to start my own, is helping me through the grieving process and to remember my baby girl.  So far I've come up with the idea of a beef and beer, which is in the works, but I'd like some other ideas that could be executed quicker than planning a full blown-out gathering.  I recently heard that the SIDS Foundation are getting that much closer to finding the cause for SIDS and I'm hoping that if enough money is raised, a cause, followed by a cure, will be in the near future, hopefully before my time on earth is done.  Thank you for all of your help and advice and I look forward to your answers : ) ; There are always the idea's of gatherings.....here is one that we have used.....ask your neighbors for donations of there old clothing and household things to have a sort of garage sale to raise money for SIDS or you can do a couple gift baskets and sale to the highest bidder.  There are so many cheap ways to put fun raisers together it is a matter to inform people so that you can provided a date and time of the fund raiser. Good luck to you and I am sorry for your lose...my the angels continue to watch over you and your family. \n\n\nSan Jose, CA",6983

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026

1,"is this even possible to solve and if u can how? ; After the parade, the ppl on the float I was on shook hands with eachother. The Mayor came over and shook hands with only the people he knew. How many people did he know if there were 1625 handshakes altogether? ; The answer is that the mayor knew 29 people. And, although you didn't ask it, there were 57 people on the float.\n\nProof:\nGiven a group of n people, if everybody shakes hands once with every other member of the group then there will be (n(n-1))/2 handshakes in total.\n1. If there were 58 people on the float then there would have been ((58*57)/2)=1653 handshakes. But this is more than the total number of handshakes specified in the question so there must have been less than 58 people on the float.\n2. If there were 56 people on the float then there would have been ((56*55)/2)=1540 handshakes. This would mean that the mayor would have had to shake hands with 85 people in order for the total number of handshakes to equal 1625. But if there were only 56 people on the float then it is impossible for the mayor to shake hands 85 times (assuming he only shakes hands once with each person he knows). So there must be more than 56 people on the float.\n2. If there were 57 people on the float then there would have been ((57*56)/2)=1596 handshakes. If the mayor shakes hands with 29 of the 57 people on the float then there would have been 1596+29=1625 handshakes which is what you wanted to know.\n\nBTW: Next time vote for a female mayor - she might have been gracious enough to shake hands with everybody on the float :)",7033

5,"Could a good Judo Black Belt hold there own grappling with a Black Belt in Jujitsu? ; I've been training in Judo and Jujitsu and found that some Judo players are really skilled on the ground.  It seems very common now for Judo players to cross train in Jujistu and to spend at least a 1/3 of the class on the matwork.  I don't know if it is the same in all regions and clubs.  I know some clubs even in my own area spend more time on matwork than other clubs.  With the popularity on MMA and jujitsu I just think the trend has been to go to more matwork and maybe the Judo players are catching up?  Or maybe the Jujistsu fighters will almost always beat the Judo guys on the ground? ; Judo is a fantastic art, in my experience a skilled judo player will have the advantage on a juijitsu trained person.\n \n However If the Judo player has no experience in practical application of Judo techniques in real life situations, or again does not know the tools of juijitsu and how to be wary of them then some of the quick applications of juijitsu groundwork may be effective. As could any technique.\n\n The only judo trained player I have seen in action was from a third world country where he had ample experience in using judo to protect his health, i do not think any juijitsu player would have stood a chance against him.\n\n In my eyes its impossible to say this stystem over this one, it is often more a case of the player. Juijitsu certainly has some technical advantages on the ground as does judo when standing\n\n however this means very little, its all very hypothetical\n if opposing players trained in each squared up, they would surely be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that each style potentially has, and do thier best to try and avoid these\n\nmat work is not very good if the judo master has just thrown you fifteen feet into a tree",7094

If, however, that doesn't mean much to you, then you're in my boat and wondering by what measure should we determine what is the best school?\n\nThe best way to judge for yourself is to visit the campus and talk to people there - formally (the public face) and informally (the face you'll get without admissions office control).

My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.  Basically, OW wasn't even in my list of places to consider.  Perhaps some things have changed in the last 15 years or perhaps not, but no new news has prompted me to change my opinion.  I made a point of visiting quite a few universities when I was searching in 1990.  I probably visited OWU, but I don't recall.  It had that much of an impression on me.  In the meantime, Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, Kenyon, Baldwin Wallace, Maimi U, OSU, and some schools in SE Michigan DID make an impression on me and I still wonder if some of them would have been a better choice.  As it was though, I made the decision based on finding a program that was relatively unique and that I found very attractive so that it wasn't the university, but the degree program that won me over.",7102

2,"My friend is facing problem of moles(til) on the face. Plz sugg. some home remedies or any ointment.? ; She is also having some black spots on the face from 10-15 days and becoming dark. ; Hi Renuka\n\nHere are some answers.\n\nCause \nWarts and moles are usually the result of a nutritional deficiency and they should be treated internally, as well as externally. \nPotassium deficiency. \n\n1.General Information for Warts and Moles: The warts, moles and skin blemishes are helped externally and are often cleared up by using the white milk from dandelions and/or from milkweed. Applying castor oil or garlic oil to the area several times a day and taping a piece of gauze soaked with this oil over the wart during the night will aid in clearing the condition. The use of a clove of garlic cut in half (or mashed or grated) and kept over the wart all night until it is gone has aided many. Black walnut tincture and the following combination tincture have been used with such success that a number of people swear by them. The combination tinctures consists of blue vervain, black cohosh, blue cohosh, skullcap and lobelia herbs in equal parts, using 90 proof or stronger alcohol as a base. \n\n2.More General Information for Warts and Moles: Use the mucusless diet and add plenty of raw carrots, kelp, dulse, or sea weed and onions to the diet. \n\n\n3.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \n\n4.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste. Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium. \n\nBest of health to you",7105
2,"How can you obtain a flat tummy after having children? ; Any expert exercise advice on this subject would be appreciated? ; im not exactly sure if this will give you a flat stomach after having kids, but i do know its easy and it gave me six pack abs. you lie flat on the ground( make sure you have plenty of padding, like good thick carpet) put your hands behind your head like your gonna do krunchs but instead lift your off the ground keeping your legs strait and bring your upper body up until you make a 90 degree angle, make sure you rotate your upper body as you go up until your left elbow is pointing towards your right knee, then go back down but dont let your feet or shoulders touch the ground, then go back up and rotate to the other side.

1,"Rotting of books? ; Why is it books and papers will just become yellow and in a lousy condition as time passes.What are the factor that are fastening it and currently,is there anyway to prevent it(for e.g in museum)? ; First the answer to the yellowing of paper in a book.  There is a substance called lignin that is found with cellulose in wood fiber.  During the paper making process, the manufacturers try to get rid of lignin as much as possible.  Some of it still remains though.  Bleaching helps to mask it, but over time this lignin reacts with humidity and light to brown.  Look at a newspaper after a few days in the sun, it's brown because they don't actually remove much lignin.\n\nNow for the fact the paper crumbles.  Cellulose and other components to paper are organic.  Organics tend to degrade over time due to instablilities in the bonds between the components.  Paper fibers bond both physically and chemically, but it the chemical bonds that keep it together.  These bonds are called hydrogen bonds, and water is needed to obtain them.  But over time, even these bonds degrade, and the paper will fall apart.  Acid-free paper is manufactured in an alkaline process, which helps to reduce the rate of degradation over time.",7134

Goal: Independence from India after annexing parts of neighboring Indian states and Burma if it has Christian majority. \nNational Liberation Front of Tripura (1989-present) A group that seeks the independence of Tripura from India to create a Christian Tripura. \nLord's Resistance Army Christian/Pagan terrorist group that operates in northern Uganda, it seeks to overthrow the Ugandan government and create a country based on the ten commandments. \nGod's Army A terrorist group in Myanmar. \n\n\nsome sikh\nSikh (Khalistan)\nBabbar Khalsa \nBhinderanwala Tiger Force of Khalistan \nInternational Sikh Youth Federation [2] \nKhalistan Zindabad Force [3] \nSaheed Kha ; Yes not all terrorists are Muslims. Unfortunately, MOST religious terrorism is committed by Muslims. So, statistically, a terrorist is more likely to be a Muslim than any other religion.\n\nAddition: Christians are more numerous than Muslims yet commit less terrorism. Also, the Chinese (Confuciusims?) are way more than the Muslims, yet they don't commit terrorism. Also, if you read my answer it says RELIGIOUS terrorism i.e. terrorism in the name of religion. IHMO, Islam is the only religion where such a concept is supported by scripture.",7157

9,"For those that say they are against the death penalty but for abortion....? ; How can you support the taking of an innocent life and be opposed to taking the life of someone that has committed acts of evil? Those on death row have hurt innocent people, families, children and society. What acts has an unborn child committed to deserve the fate of being aborted. \n\nThis is a perfect example of how liberals are on the wrong side of issues. Liberals will claim that abortion is a right to privacy issue - the so called, ""it is my body and I can do with it what I wish"". Well- a person cannot do whatever they wish with their body if it effects me. You cannot take your fist (which is part of your body) and punch me in the face. A person has the right to privacy in their home, but that does not extend to activities which are illegal. Your rights end where my rights begin. A heart beats at less than 4 weeks. Isn't a heart beat the final determinat ; I know you don't actually want an answer - you seem more interested in pontificating.  Be that as it may, it is perfectly easy to justify a belief in the legality of abortion vs. the legality of the death penalty.  For me, capital punishment is a governmental rights issue - that is, I do not believe the government has the right to deprive its citizens of life under any circumstances.  It's simply something the government should not be allowed to do, because allowing it for some people (odious though they may be) makes it easier to apply it for lesser crimes - a slippery slope argument, essentially.\n\nAbortion is a different issue, because (1) it is not the government depriving someone of life; (2) there's no scientific reason to argue that life begins at conception; and (3) if we assume life begins at conception, then all laws regarding children would apply to zygotes/fetuses, which would be unworkable in any society.",7165

1,"where can i find pictures of chordates without backbones? ; chordates without a backbone ; The only living chordates that do not have backbones are the ""protochordates"", that is, the members of phyla Urochordata or Tunicata (sea squirts) and Cephalochordata (lancelets). These chordates have the primitive support structure, a dorsal notochord. \nAdult Tunicates lack notochords, except for the planktoninc and tiny Appendiculaceans.  Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse. Almost all are included in genus Branchiostoma, so if you look for ""Branchiostoma"" or ""lancelet"" you'll get what you're searching.",7179

It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

As you already know, lab tech is the most common dead end for a BA, unless you can manage to get into a company that will allow to move up.  Then you might only have to be a lab rat for maybe 5-10 years.\n\nIf you have some sales experience (preferably outside sales), a few friends in pharamceutical industry, and a very outgoing personality, you might have a pretty good chance at geting into pharmaceutical sales (though not all of these qualities are always required).  Sales reps make a lot of money and often only have a bachelors degree.  But they are generally unhappy, the only exceptions being those who truly enjoy sales and don't mind the hectic lifestyle.  \n\nReally, if you don't want to be a lab tech and have no interest in sales, go back to school.

But don't just get the basic lettuce and tomato/carrot kind, to make them really healthy and make sure you get your protein and other nutrients like beta-carotenes and amino acids...add beans like garbanzo, adzuki, pinto, lima etc....whatever you like.  Add beets, carrots, tomatoes, jicama, potatoes, corn, peas, tofu, nuts of all kinds like cashews, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts.  Then make sure you get a good salad dressing that is not full of hydrogenated fats and MSG.  IN fact, avoid all that stuff if you can.  If you want to be healthy, then read ingredient lables and avoid things like hydrogenate/trans fats, MSG, food colorings, preservatives and sugar if possible.  Those will certainly decrease your health overtime.  \nHere's something else very viable for someone who only has once a week cooking time and is low income.  I feel for you girl!  I was the same while living in LA and it just about killed my spirit.

Like 6 or 8+.  THen goto Costco or another large chain store where you can buy bulk for less $.  \nBuy salad makings, canned beans/corn/peas etc...salad dressing and look for ground turkey too. \n\nYou can then make up salads for a few days and put them in the tupperware.  Make sure you drain all  the beans and stuff of water so that they don't wilt the salad lettuce.  Don't add dressing either, it will wilt it.  Add that later.  Buy a tupperware thingy for dressing too..a small one. \n\nThen make a large turkey meatloaf or chicken soup and split it into containers for the weeks.  I know it's boring but do a different meal each week.  It's what you sometimes have to do when  you're poor.  It sucks but it's better than eating crap at a fast food place.  You know!  \n\nTry making large meals and spliting into many containers, freezing them  until ready for use.  Meatloaf, stuffed cabbage with meat and rice in tomato sauce, tuna casseroles and soup and stuff like that freezes well. Let all the food cool first.  You can also make cheap stir frys with veggies and rice and soy sauce which is cheap and goes a long way.  Just watch your salt intake.

He was first diagnosed three years ago. ; When people are diagnosed with Hep C, the doctor will order a VIRAL LOAD which reports exactly how much of the virus exists in the body.  A high viral load means that the person has more of the virus in their system.

The doctor was checking his viral load which tells how well the treatment is working.  As long as your husband's viral load was decreasing, it means the treatment was effective.  There becomes a point where the Hep C viral load becomes indetectable.... meaning the viral load is basically 0.  This doesn't mean that it is cured, as your husband will always run the risk of having the virus become active again, but at this point he has no detectable Hep Viral particles in his system.  So for all intents and purposes, he is cured.  At this point he is less contageous than before.

1,"About my last question regarding Maxwell Wheel.? ; In the Maxwell Wheel the angular velocity is w = v/r where r is the pole's radius and v is the translational velocity of the pole. But the v is also the tangential velocity of each point at the surface of the pole. So I understand that these velocities are equal (Why is that?) Furthermore, the angular velocity of the wheel is equal to the angular velocity of the pole, right? But in that case w=V/R, when V supposed to be the translational velocity of the wheel, don't it? But the translational velocities of the wheel and the pole are equal (they're falling together), so V=v,\nbut R!=r (not equal) so this is a paradox. Where am I wrong? ; ok.  call the downward translational velocity of the whole thing v.  this means that the tangential velocity at the edge of the poles (at the radius r) is equal to v.  the reason for this is that the strings are wound AROUND THE POLES, so this winding and the condition that the string has to unwrap for the thing to move, sets the angular velocity w = v/r.\n\nnow, if you look at the main wheel part, the angular velocity has to be equal to the angular velocity of the poles, since they are one solid piece.  however, as you note the radius of the wheel R > r.  so, the fact that v / r = w = V / R implies that V > v.  in other words, the motion of the outer edges of the wheel is faster than the motion of the outer edges of the rods.\n\ni think you are getting confused by saying that V is the translational velocity of the wheel.  it's not.  v is the translational velocity of the wheel, and of the rods.  the fact that the string is wound *around the rods* and not around the wheel sets the angular velocity of the whole apparatus equal to v/r.  V, the tangential velocity of the outer edges of the wheel, is much faster than the translational velocity.\n\nthat clear?",7320

Is there a way I can configer my computer to make it look like I live in the US? Thank you ; Yes, you can use a proxy server.  A proxy server acts like a middle man.  When you want to download from a website, your request goes through the proxy server.  The proxy server in turn makes the request to the website.  The website only sees the proxy server and not you.

8,"Guys-- why is the idea of having sex with two girls pleasurable? ; My BF told me before he could have sex with two girls- one of them being me of course.  But I cannot stand the thought of watching him having sex with another girl. This bothers me especially after vowing with each other we wouldn't have sex with other people.  Is this a product of his porn watching and wanting to experience new things? I think I give him plenty of sex and good sex too. I don't understand... ; Ok, I have to say that a lot of the answers that you have received so far are close, but none of them quite hit the mark or cover all the bases, so I am going to see what I can do here. \n First of all, I am fairly qualified here as my fiancé and I have done a threesome with both another woman and another guy, and our relationship has survived it unscathed. \n To answer the main question of why. . . There is no single answer that would apply to all men that have those desires. Yes, porn for a lot of us has glorified the threesome. Another common reason is that watching two women be intimate is quite erotic. Lets face it, they call you the ""fairer sex"" for a reason!!\n Could your BF feel pressure to please you? If so, a second person could be viewed as a helper.\n The most common reason, however, is simply the desire to have variety in ones sex life.\n Now, let's address how you should go forward. First of all, your BF shared a fantasy with you, and if you ever want him to ever do so again, you cannot react negatively to it. That does not mean that you have to do it, but you also want to avoid him feeling rejection from it.\n To help you decide if having a threesome with another woman is something you want to do, consider this:\n Are you physically attracted to women? I.E. Are you bi/bi-curious? If so, you could decide that you are will have a threesome with him with the stipulation that he and the other woman do not have sex. Set very specific boundaries, I.E. Is touching ok? Is kissing ok? Is manual stimulation ok? Etc. . . If you cannot trust him to abide by these boundaries during the heat of the moment, you do NOT want to do this!\n If you decide that you do not want to do this, explain it to him, but offer to incorporate it into your fantasy life. Say something to him like ""The idea turns me on, but I would not be ok with the reality of it"", and then bring it up in a sexy way during foreplay or lovemaking. Reiterate after you are done having sex that this is something that can only be a fantasy, never a reality. This is often the perfect compromise in these situations.\n In my experience, a man bringing this fantasy to his significant other is generally sign of developing trust, and not of impending doom. The act itself, however, has been the end of many strong relationships, so tread carefully!!",7395

You know, she does all the socially right things (like immediate thank you notes, volunteering to cook on family holidays, sending flowers when people have had a rough week- that type of stuff). But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could.

I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

I don't remember conversations and never got to know him. I miss what i could of had. There is no real getting over it. It's more of accepting the way things are. I know i can't bring him back and it sucks. One thing i read recently i wish i could remember where. The article was about making a patch work quilt in your mind with the people in your life that have the qualities that you would want in a mother or father. Say you have a friend who is really good at listening, that can be a piece of what a mom is to you. Someone else in your life who encourages you is another part of what a mom is to you and slowly you piece together a mother. Instead of getting all of a mom in one person many people end up fill the void that is empty. It will never be the same as the real thing but that is where acceptance is a huge part of learning to cope. You will always miss them and wonder what life would be like with them. I wish i had a better answer for you. Sincerely,if during my journey in finding acceptance with my fathers death i learn something better i will let you know.",7494

Prolactin gets the breast ready to secrete milk.  During lactation prolactin also synthesizes the milk.  Prolactin production is stimulated by the infant suckling.  \nOxytocin is also a hormone that plays a role in lactation.  Just as prolactin is stimulated by infant suckling, so is oxytocin.  As the infant suckles, the posterior pituary is triggered to produce oxytocin.  Oxytocin is responsible for the milk ejection reflex.  This reflex is accomplished by oxytocin stimulating the myoepithelial cell around the nipple and allowing the milk to be expressed through the ducts and out the nipple.",7511

2,"what can a person take to control cough? ; Without taking a perscription drug. ; HI BARB\n\nHere is the cause and a remedy for you.\n\nCause \nThis is often caused by a stomach disorder that comes from overloading the system with food, wherein fermentation in the stomach causes phlegm. It may also be induced by inflammation in the bronchial tubes due to a neglected cold. Worms may be the cause. Many coughs are from a nervous condition, where coughing may eventually become habitual. Coughs are highly misunderstood. Usually a sore throat and coughing are caused by the sinuses draining the eustachian tubes, which is like pouring acid down the throat. A cough usually comes from a lowered vitality in the system from improper diet, loss of sleep, lack of exercise, and fresh air, improper breathing, poor elimination, or improper night clothing and bedding. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1. Acute coughs can often be relieved with a little honey and onion syrup. When it is the result of an old acute condition, clear out the morbid condition as rapidly as possible without causing irritation. In old cough conditions, comfrey with vervain or mullein are very good. The antispasmodic tincture is also excellent, and it is good to massage the chest area across the back with an antispasmodic tincture during attacks of spasms. Antispasmodic tincture may be used both internally and externally as a liniment on the throat. If this is due to a neglected cold, any of the diaphoretic herbs are excellent. To relieve the coughing spasms, use horehounds, comfrey, or a small amount of lobelia. High enemas of herbal laxatives will relieve congestion of the bowels, and if the cough is severe (asthma, whooping cough) load the stomach with liquids and induce vomiting. \n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers",7531

In a leaf the chlorophyll is in solution.\n\nLeaves turning brown most likely involves encymatic digestion of parts of the molecule. The core construction of chlorophyll is quite hardy - a flat system of five- or six-atom rings with a central magnesium ion held in place by nitrogen atoms pointing to it in a square. (Hemoglobine and one of the vitamins have a similar basic structure, hemoglobine with iron in the centre and the vitamin with cobalt.)\n\nYou can dry a leaf and keep the chlorophyll intact at temperatures up to 120°C without any browning effect. Such a dried leaf will remain green, unlike a wet leaf where encymatic digestion will destroy the pigment.\n\nThe leaf will turn brown at temperatures where paper also begins to turn brown - when the cellulosis of the plant cells begins to split off water.

Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are). The Plextor PX-504U is an example of an external DVD+R/+RW drive capable of recording single layer discs in the +R/+RW format, but also able to read discs recorded by a DVD-R drive.",7559

The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom. Solve this triangle for line A-bottom to B-bottom for distance between the two buildings.\nTriangle 2: A-top to B-top to B-bottom. Solve this triangle for line B-top to B-bottom for height of building. \n\nDon't forget, we have two important angles that will help solve these two triangles!",7575
6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business. Treat your loyal customers well and they will return to you every morning and will start bringing in their friends. Give customers a few low cost freebies and taste tests. They will definitely remember your generosity. \n\nI hope that helps a bit!\n\n~Mark Lim\n\nhttp://www.poisonappleshirts.com",7576

Many, many Jewish people over the last 2000 years have given their lives to the Messiah yet retained their Judaism.\n\nThe Messiah is Jewish.

Should we, as Jews, turn our backs on His heritage in order consider ourselves Christians?\n\nHowever, we should strive to live the way God intended, not the way the Rabbi's have fenced off the law and made it more of a burden then it was ever intended to be.

1,"How to solve the Three-Jugs Problem mathematically (Very Complicated!!)? ; Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of water wish to share it evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

Such as Choloroform(CHCl3), Na2SO4, KCl, and BaSo4\n\nI would greatly appreciate anyone's help with this! ; We've to get this clear first. Water is a polar solvent, gasoline is a non-polar solvent. By the principal of like-dissolves-like, polar molecules will dissolve in water, for example, NaCl; while non-polar molecules will dissolve in gasoline, for example, fats, phosholipids, alkanes, alkenes etc.\n\nFor the question you've asked,\nChloroform is a polar compund because Cl draws electrons from the carbon center and making Cl atoms have a higher concerntration of electrons. Hydrogen atoms in water carry a partially positive charge and hence are attracted to Cl molecule. Hence it is soluble in water.\n\nNa2SO4 is soluble in water. This is because it is actually 2 Na+ ions attached to SO4(2-) ions. Na+ ions get attracted to oxygen atoms in water which has a partially negative charge and SO4(2-) ions gets attracted to hydrogen atoms in water which has a partially positive charge.\n\nKCL is soluble in water because Cl atoms draws electrons from K. Follow the same reasoning as chloroform.\n\nFor BaSO4, it is insoluble in water. Only barium nitrate dissolves in water. Other barium salts do not.\n\nHope this helps! =)",7637

Whenever i take one of those tests that tells you what career and major suits you, they have me all wrong and what they say completely aren't right for me. Anyone have any ideas as how i can figure out what to do? ; OK, I have a lot to say about this, so please give this a read. \n\nI have three college degrees. One is an associate's (I went to a community college), one is a bachelor's, and one is a master's. I didn't decide on my major until my junior year of college, and even then, I wasn't sure if I made the right decision. \n\nDO NOT let anyone tell you that you have to decide right away. You don't. Declare yourself a liberal arts major and take as many different classes as you can. Take what sounds interesting. Take internships. Take as much as you can! The only way to find out what you want to do is explore and experiment. \n\nAnd you don't have to know what you want to do for a living right out of high school OR college. I'm 28, and I've just decided what my ""calling"" is. It took me a long time, but I finally made it. \n\nBut I also want to go back to school for more education in areas where I didn't get to take classes. So, please, explore and don't let anyone pressure you into choosing a major.\n\nBy the way, I majored in English, and the only reason I did it is because I love to write. I didn't make the decision for careers because I'm certainly not making a lot of money off of my writing. :)\n\nGood luck, and my best to you with whatever decisions you make!",7651
9,"what is the difference between peace and war and which one is better? ; so if you're answer is peace is better than war why the people also choose the war and why they broke the peace why they all takecare about the war hate died and all bad thing why they don't wanna to take carre about the gift of the GOD peace live and love ; Unfortunately War is a necessary evil. It sucks, and no one wants to go through it. Well let me re-phrase that, normal people don't want to go through it. But that is why it is at times necessary, not everyone is normal. Occasionally you get a bad guy or group who wants to dominate people by fear and torture. These are not reasonable people, and therefore are not reasoned with by peace or the nicer ways to negotiate, they see peace as a weakness, and try to use it as a way to overcome the peaceful. Anyone who thinks peace is the only way is right (in a perfect world). We don't live in a perfect world so at times war is the only way to get rid of the bad people. Yes war also means death to innocent people and harm and danger to the good forces who fight for the pure cause. Well it is either that or everyone around the world die and suffer under tyrannical groups/rule. The US and Allied military forces understand this concept now more than ever, and they are willing to put their lives on the line to fight for the citizen's of the World freedoms and liberties, which is the desired result of the War on Terror (which does include Iraq, whether anyone wants to admit it, the past regime was a regime which supported and committed terrorist activities on it's own people and the rest of the world). I know War sucks; peace is always the more desired path. But go tell that to the terrorists and see how long you stand alive in their presence.",7657

5,"How much less does golf ball fly in cold temperature?  7 iron 150 yards  in 80 F  vs 50 F? ; and the drive  250 yards  in 80  vs 50 F ? ; I could not find any information about distance.  I cut and paste some info I found.  I sent my Titleist Rep an e-mail asking the same question.  I will send you the info.  \n\nGolf balls travel farther when they are warm.\nSomewhat true. Colder temperatures do decrease a ball's velocity more than warm temperatures; although, the air temperature affects distance much more significantly than the temperature of the ball. The moral of the story is don't bother putting the ball in the oven before teeing off. Your pocket will do just fine. A two-piece ball will have a little faster initial velocity off the clubface in cold weather, so keep that in mind next time the frost is on the ground. \n\nThe weather report also influences which ball to choose. Warm conditions can expand balls, calling for players to use a higher compression. A harder ball helps in high humidity or in low sea level areas, where thick air slows the ball down. \n\nConversely, cold weather tends to harden the ball. Players can counteract the effect by choosing lower compression balls. Softer balls also help in high altitudes where air is thinner and there is less resistance",7666

1,"why is momentum important in physics? ; I personally don't think that momentum is particularly important, but if so, why is it important in physics? ; Momentum is the direct result of the following Newtonian Law of Inertia\nAny object in motion remains in motion and any object at rest remains at rest (unless a net force acts upon the object)\nMomentum (p) is the mass (m) of the object times its velocity (v).\np = mv\n\nForce (F) and Newtons Second Law can be derive from a change in momentum.  That is (t is time)\nF = delta p/delta t \nF = delta (m*v) / dt\nwe usually say m is constant so\nF = m * v/dt\nF =  ma    (a is acceleration or a change in v/time)\n\nNewtons third law is also based on momentum.  ""For every action there is an equal, yet opposite, reaction.""\n\nSo...  When a gun is fired what we see is the bullet propelled forward and the gun (and gun holder) propelled back.  Both received the same Force but because the gun and person holding it are much more massive than the bullet, the bullet will travel much faster. \ne.g F1 is the force on the bullet which is the same as the force on the person F2\nF1 = F2\ndelta p1/dt = delta p2/dt\nm1v1/dt = m2v2/dt\nm1v1 =m2v2\nImagine the bullet is 1 gram and a 180 lbs (~8182 grams) person shot the bullet...

9,"Why don't liberals get upset about Clinton authorizing illegal wiretaps & searches during his time in office? ; Found the following while messing around on the web:\n\n\nhttp://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-271.html\n\n\nThe Clinton administration claims that it can bypass the warrant clause for ""national security"" purposes. In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part. Hmmm. Seems to be missing from the site you posted as well.\n\nFirst, if trying to construct an argument, you may want to pull facts from something other than a conservative spin house. By the way, the same goes for liberals. I'm tired of seeing people posting links to places of strong bias.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to this. The part your missing is when Clinton got the smack layed down on him.\n\nYou see, he had the authority in 1993 but he didn't use it  (or get caught rather) until a few years later. When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this. At least, amongst the people I knew then (many of them liberals).\n\nMy view on the whole thing is to get rid of it. It's to dangerous in the hands of the executive, especially when said executive has granted himself to power to declare whether or not someone is an enemy.\n\nI don't want to see ANYONE with that power. Period. It goes against everything this country stands for.\n\n~X~",7775

Please help! ; Id be curious to know whats causing the anxiety.

CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc ; Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode.",7790

There are 53 countries in Africa and the western media chooses to focus on the 4 or so countries that are embroiled in war to show their ignorant citizens who do not know any better. \nFourth, it is because of ignorant bigots like you that is why FIFA has chosen to rotate the WC amongst continents so that your eyes and your mind can be open to the rest of the world instead of your little corner which you think is the whole world.\n\nYes, I am from a country in the African continent and I see this as an affront, but I should not, because you are an ignorant bigot who will probably turn out to be zenophobic as well.\n\nP.S.

5,"when was the first time someone used a snowboard and what country or if in usa what state.? ; please answer this correctly it for a school assiment. ; Did you know that the first of the snowboards goes back all the way to 1929? Back then they has skis, but the first person to come up with the idea of a snowboard was a man named M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett. He cut out a plank of plywood and tried to stick his feet to the wood with the help of some clothes and horse reins. It was over 30 years after Burchett that the next step was taken towards the evolution of snowboards. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a chemical gases engineer in Muskegon invented the “The Snurfer”. The name was given by his wife. He came up with the “The Snurfer” in order to entertain his daughter. He made the Snurfer by putting two skis together and putting a rope at the nose so that the rider could hold it and keep it stable. Many of his friends were interested in this Snurfer and that inspired him into licensing his idea to a manufacturer. The Snurfer sold over half a million in 1966 but was only seen as a toy for kids, not something serious enough for adult entertainment. Poppen organized competitions in order to make the Snurfer even more poppular. Jake Burton was really into the Snurfer and participated in the competitions organized by Poppen. Since Burton’s parents wouldn’t buy him a board and let him surf, he amused himself with the Snurfer. He was also very into skiing alongside the Snurfer, but he broke his collarbone in a car accident and couldn’t participate in ski competitions anymore. Meanwhile, a college student, &#92;Dimitrije Milovich started making snowboards in 1969. He came up with the idea after sliding down with a cafeteria plate in College. He started his own company in 1972 with the name “Winterstick”. He got reviewed on Newsweek and Playboy, which increased the popularity of snowboards. Although he left the business in 1980, he is still recognised as one of the most important pioneers in developing snowboards. In 1977, Burton, after graduating from NYU moved to Vermont and started producing new versions of the Snurfer which he still remembered from childhood. He came up with the first binding and he amazed people when he won the Snurfer competition with his very own board with the bindings on it.",7967
4,"Can someone give me a site for info on creating games? ; i am making a gmae but i have no idea wat to do help me out here. i have to start from nothing send me everything i need to know aboutcreating games. ; First, to create a game, you need to learn something about programming...\n A game is a computer program, so to create a game, you need to program it, or something like this... There are lots of programming languages like: Pascal, Java, C+, C++, Visual Basic, Python etc. With all theese fascinating programming languages you can create lots of cool games... Most games are written in Java. So Java, is a good start...There are also programs which let you create a game without any programming, such as: Game Maker. You can make lots of different kinds of games with it. But theese games are simple. You can't make cool staff with them... This could be a solution if you don't want to learn a programming language. Of course, a real programming language will offer you much more possibilities. The language that is probably used most for games is C and C++. Dev-C++ is a very good (and free) environment to write C/C++ programs in. There are several game libraries you can use with Dev-C++.Another complete system for writing games (for Windows) is the Clean Game Library. It's really cool... Trust me... This is a real programming language, so you will need to write a code. The number of lines you have to write is smaller for example about 3,000 for a game like SAINT NICOLAAS, but the language is very hard to learn. I don't know very much about programming, but if you want to be a good progammer and create lots of games, you need to start by programming, not by simple games creators, or something like this... They're usefull just for begginers... I hope this helped you, a bit...",7969

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

1,"Explain theory of relativity.? ; please explain it in simplest language.\n\nalso is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nif it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets in it!! ; There are plenty of good websites that answer this question, for any knowledge level. The concept is complex enough that you won’t get a meaningful answer here.\n\nIn horribly oversimplified terms Relativity simply states two things.\n\nOne that there is no universal ‘at rest point’, it all depends on how you choose to define it. You sit in a car doing 100mph and I stand beside the road. Normally we assume that you are in motion and I am at rest. Relativity states that we can just as accurately say that you and the car are at rest and I am moving at 100mph. Alternatively, we normally believe that the Earth orbits the sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Relativity states that it is just as accurate to say that the Earth orbits the moon and the sun orbits the Earth, or we could say that we all orbit some imaginary point in between all three. It is all a matter of choice what we define as being the fixed point.\n\nThe second is that the speed of light is constant regardless of whether you are at rest or moving, and regardless of how fast you move. If you are sitting in a car doing 9/10 of lightspeed and are going past me standing still beside the road and we both look at exactly the same light beam shining down the road we will both see that light beam travelling away from us at exactly the speed of light relative to both of us. You don’t see it slowed down just because you are travelling almost as fast as it is. It will move away form me just as fast as it moves away form you.\n\nThose are the basics, and they aren’t all that hard to understand, even if they don’t seem to make much sense. What Einstein did was sit down and think really hard about the logical consequences of those two points.\n\n\n>>>>>>also is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nYes.\n\n>>>>>if it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets\n>>>> in it!!\n\n\nNo. Just as the Earth doesn't suck the moon in despite having much higher gravity.\n\nThe planets orbitthe Sun. In simple terms that means they are constantly falling around the sun in a ciruclar pattern.\n\nThe best way I have heard this described for the layman  is to imagine yourself throwing a heavy weight like a shotput. You could only throw it a few metres. Now imagine standingon the roof of a house and throwing that same shotput. This time it will go much further before it hits the gorund. Now go to the top of a rally high cliff and throw it. This time the shotput will travel for 20 or 30 metres before it hits the ground.\n\nThe higher you go the further somehting thrown will travel before it hits the ground. And if you go high enough the object will travel right around the world and back to where it starts before it hits the ground. It will continue falling forever. \n\nThe planets are doing exactly that WRT the sun. We are constantly flaling aorund the sun, but we can't be sucked in because we are falling from such a great height.",8070

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",8087
6,"How do you come at these totals? ; An investment of $10,000 that earns 10% annually over the course of 40 years will amount to nearly $453,000. Over the course of just 25 years, however, that same 10 grand increases to a mere $108,347. ; To keep it very simple, the answer is: it grows exponentially by compounding interest.  With that said, over time the 10% is added to the previous years value so after each year the base value is greater.

9,"Military guys, question about ammo.? ; My experience with military arms and ammo is confined to the .303 British round and the 7.62x51mm that replaced it .Both are hard hitting long range rounds...So how happy are you guys with the 5.56x45mm? I have read that it isn't always effective? ..Taking into consideration factors like weight of ammo you can carry, range,recoil,accuracy,and effectiveness against hostiles,vehicles and buildings would you prefer something else? Maybe the 7.62x39 or what about the new 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge? Any news on how this last cartridge is performing in action? Maybe they have finally found the right balance of cartridge size and effectiveness? ; Unhappy.\nHowever there are many different and important factors to keep in mind. The 556 is a small round. Its actually a 22 caliber round.  It is very light weight. Much less then the 7.62x51 (308 winchester). However the 556 is meant to be fired at full auto. The 7.62x51 (by which i will refer to as the 308) is much heavier much more powerful and has too much recoil for full auto. The 308 is still used as a sniper round, even though several others are much better, such as 30-06, or several other (e-mail me and i will tell you why they use the 308) and the 308 is the ammo used for the M240 light machine gun. the 208 is the perfect round for the light machine gun. Say any different and my brother will mix words with you. \nWhatever the government says, the 556 was designed to penetrate soviet body armor. It mushrooms when passing through body armor and actaully has more shock value (due to increased surface area) despite going through the armor. It takes too many hits to take down an opponet and wastes too much ammo. Its really a shame, because there are civial loads of 556 (teachnically 223, because they are on the civilan market) that have much heavier bullets and have far greater stopping power.\n\nthe 6.8 is too dangerous.  Say you are a Marine Force Reacon guy, or Amry Ranger and you are shooting these great 6.8 bullets and killing every enemy. No problem, right? But wait.... You have run out of ammo. you can not resupply from friendly troops, and no one has 6.8 anywhere. You are screwed.  \n\n6.8 is battering M16's to death too. its way too powerful for the gas operating systems and the recievers.\nIf we had new guns built to stronger tolerances then 6.8 would really be great.",8106

I can not explain to you how it felt,more pain than I have ever tried to withstand.I lost 18 pounds in 3 weeks,I slept all the time-at least when I was not crying.\nIt had nothing to do with wanting to be dead-I just wanted the hurt to stop because I could no longer stand it.\nDue to a miracle I was saved (yes, my dr. used that term) and I checked myself into a psychartic hospital for the sucidial where I meet lots of people like me.I was there 2 weeks.\nI learned so much from those people and often think of them.\nIn the hospital was a children's ward and the kids would come to the cafeteria as a group-all those teenage girls some with there wrists bandaged.\nBut one sticks in my mind-the youngest one there-a 3 year old boy who had cut his wrists with a knife. The nurse told me it was not his first attempt.\nSuicidal people do not have the same thought process as ""normal"" people.They can be born that way or have a tramatic experience that ""changes"" there thought process.\nEveryone I met in the hospital said the same thing-not one of us WANTED to die we didn't think we had a RIGHT to die.\nSuicide is about a person being in so much pain,crushing pain,unbearbale pain,non-stop pain that death is a way to relieve the pain.\nYou may use any of this in your paper or email any questions to me.",8175
2,"Naproxen or Ibuprofen?  Which is better for sciatic problems? ; I am experiencing shooting pain when I move ""wrong"" but not all the time. ; Most sciatica pain responds well to self-measures.  You'll heal more quickly if you continue your usual activities but be sure to avoid the move that triggers the pain.  For pain relief, you'll have to see what works best for you.  NSAIDs such as aspirin, naproxen sodium and ibuprofen will alleviate both pain and inflammation.  Acetaminophen alleviates pain only.  But there's a limit as to how much pain these can control.  Make sure your doctor is aware of what you take, how much & how often and how effective it is.  For more severe pain that is unrelieved or inadequately relieved by NSAIDs or Tylenol, your doctor may want to prescribe an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxer, a tricyclic antidepressant or an anticonvulsant.  You can also use the hot-cold method.  When the pain starts, apply ice packs or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel to the affected areas for 15-20 min. 4x a day.  After 48 hrs. apply heat (heating pad on the lowest setting, heat packs commercially sold or a heat lamp).  You can alternate hot and cold if necessary.\n\nGentle stretching for the lower back may relieve nerve root compression and make you feel better but try not to jerk or twist your back.\n\nProlonged rest will worsen your pain.  FYI:  Naprosyn (naproxen sodium) is available over-the-counter.   You don't need a prescription.  And Aleve IS naproxen.",8176

6,"How could the US currency collapse overnight, either realistically or unrealistically? ; Excluding terrorism or natural disasters. Also, would a stock market crash cause the dollar to collapse? If so, what scenario is needed for the US stock market to crash overnight like in 1929? ; The dollar is not directly linked to the stock market. It is a strong currency in that many developing countries, including China, stockpile dollars to give them some ""hard currency"" strength. The danger is really the longer-term decline of the dollar versus other ""hard currencies"" such as the euro and yen. The dollar is also strengthened by its ties to various commodities, such as oil, which is denominated in dollars. If Russia and the Middle East countries begin selling oil to Europe or China for euros or gold dinars in a big way, then the dollar would lose more of that stability. Inflation and investors' currency speculation are additional variables. But it is unlikely that the dollar would crash overnight, because those that you might think would benefit from this (such as China) would actually lose billions and billions overnight if all their dollar holdings lost huge value. Longterm erosion in the dollar value is much more likely.",8259

1,"How do 3M Tattletapes, used on library books, work? ; Tattle Tapes are used by libraries to attach to books and other media.  When you check out books, the librarians would ""desensitize"" the books.  When you return the books, they would ""sensitize"" them.  Do these systems use magnetic fields?  The amazing things about them are that they hold their sensitivity for a long time and these tapes can be desnsitize and resensitize as many times as possible. ; yes, they use magnetic fields.  3m appears to not publicize how the technology works (presumably for good reason, if it was well understood then it would be easy to defeat!)\n\nanyway i found a patent for a detection system that has some background that explains how they work.  basically they are a sandwich of 2 kinds of material.  one is a permanently magnetic material, and the other is a permanently-magnetizable material.  the poles of the two materials are oriented in opposite directions.  when you bring the magnetizable material near a strong magnet, it is magnetized, and the magnetic fields cancel out.\nthis allows them to pass through a detector without setting it off.  then when they are returned, they are exposed to a field that orients the magnetizable material the other way, which makes the fields add up into a strong magnetic field. this makes them set off the detector when you walk through it.\n\nmore info at the link below, which is not a patent for tattle-tape, but a patent for some kind of sensitizing/desensitizing system for tattle-tape:\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1='tattle+tape'&OS=%22tattle+tape%22&RS=%22tattle+tape%22",8308

When they tighten them, it doesn't hurt when they do this but your teeth get sore for a couple of days after as that is when they move the most, advil takes away pretty much all the pain though.  The first couple of weeks my braces were on the insides of my lips were cut and raw from rubbing against my brace.  This does go away in time as your mouth just gets used to them.  In the meantime, if you put the wax on your braces, it keeps them from rubbing on the inside of your mouth so much but it is a little funny feeling.  They will give you special stuff to use to floss and show you how to use it.  I don't remember the spacers hurting, I could be wrong but if they did hurt it was not bad enough that I remember.  The only thing I couldn't really eat was gum and really chewy candy, but there were some things I had to cut up instead of just taking a bite out of like apples and such.  I think this is the most of what I remember.  What I would tell you to remember is as annoying as having braces is...it is worth it when they come off and you have these really nice straight teeth.",8312
5,"What are some good streches? ; I have recently started to exercise a bit more, mainly by jogging/running.  I've noticed that I get shin splints just after a little bit of doing either, and it also hurts my calf muscle too.  Can anyone suggest some good streches for me to do before jogging? ; Well shin splints occur from your main calf muscle dominating all those little muscles around your bone. To help that and to prevent it from happening again, make sure to do a lot of calf raises. These strengthen all your calf muscles and also help warm up the calf muscle. \n\nTo stretch the calf muscle, you can do a couple of different stretches. You can get into a push up position on the ground with one leg, and push the heel back and down onto the ground. Feel the stretch along the back of your calf and knee. Then switch legs. You could also stand up against a rail or fence with posts about a foot or a foot and a half away. Put one foot up against the post with the heel on the ground, and sort of sit into it until you feel the pull on the back of your calf and knee. These should loosen up your calves before you run.\n\nMuscles sometimes tighten up due to deficiencies in diet, too. Try to take in more potassium. Bananas are the healthiest way to get more potassium in your diet without all the other extra sugar and yucky stuff found in orange juice or other 'sources' of potassium. If you eat a banana an hour or two before you run, your muscles won't be as prone to tightening up.\n\nHave fun exercising! Running is awesome!",8318

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

6,"Can my S-Corp pay me as an independent contractor rather than an employee? ; I own an S-Corp and do consulting services through my S-Corp.  I am the only person doing any work.  Also, I find employment taxes to be a pain in the butt, calculating income and self-employment taxes, making sure I send the payments in on time, yada yada.  Would it be ok to just consider myself an independent contractor for my company and 1099 myself at the end of the year?  That way the IRS still gets their Social Security tax right, I just don't have to waste time with all the hassles of having an employee... So what I'm saying is, would this raise any red flags, and if I were audited would this be an ok thing that wouldn't get me in trouble? ; I'm not fully sure, but offhand I think the answer here is not a good idea.\n\nThe IRS looks at the line for officer's compensation in comparison to the rest of the return looking for someone trying to take all their compensation out via dividends.\n\nAlthough this isn't your case, I think it would be hard to argue that you are an independent contractor because of your relationship with the company.  Generally, this is a hot button issue with the IRS as many 'think' they can fit into the independent contractor because the definition is really vague.  \n\nIn any case, I'd consult your tax advisor for a look during your tax planning.",8388

The problem is that if you stand before God on Judgement day Guilty, God will have to punish you In Hell because he is Holy and just.

2,"Carpel Tunnel Syndrome? ; Where I work, I have to use the computer a lot, and working my wrists a lot (office work).\nIf I get CTS, and it gets to a point where it affects my work, can I get comphensation for that (from the company)? Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393

1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity. This is it.",8397

(protecting weaker countries and peoples from hostiles) ; Violence as a solution to any problem should only be a last resort. In a perfect world there would be no war, but we do not live in a perfect world. The United States cannot police the whole world it is just unworkable and unrealistic. The problem in the way we choose our fights. Wars we engage in are the ones where we perceive a vital national interest rather than a humanitarian one. Iraq is a good example. While there is a humanitarian side of the conflict, we would not be there if the country did not possess a large oil supply. Oil is central to the US economy and therefore represents a vital national interest. Compare this with Dafur. A terrible genocide is occurring there, but honestly speaking they have nothing we want. The optimum world military situation would be one where nations acted together against tyrants, but unfortunately political realities do not allow for this.",8399

1,"Importance of limiting reagents? ; Why is it important to have a limiting reagent when performing a lab experiment? and why is it not simpler to make both reactions go to completion? ; In some cases, when the reaction rate is fast, and the reaction goes all the way to completion, one uses the stoichiometric amounts necessary to convert all of reactants.  But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.  So, you use a large excess of one of the reactants, which causes all, or almost all, of the other reactant to be converted.",8475
1,"How can I design a BKU chiller heat exchanger? ; Any sample calculations would be useful to calculate the LMTD and heat transferred ; When you say you want to design a chiller, I assume you mean the process design not the mechanical design. \n\nThe amount of heat being transferred is a given based on the process requirements. \n\nSince this is a BKU the shell side temperature both in and out will be the temperature of the refrigerant ""bath"" therefore the LMTD calculation is pretty straight forward.\n\nThe inlet and outlet temperatures on the tube side are also process design requirement and fixed by the process. \n\nThe actual materials of construction have very little to do with the actual sizing of the exchanger. Knowing the overall heat transfer coefficient is more a factor of the boiling liquid on the shell side and any condensing on the tube side. Velocity through the tubes is also a main factor.\n\nThe actual calculations are a trial and error method, because of this there are many computer programs to do the calculation for you. To attempt to provide a set of useful sample calculations on this site is not possible. You have to assume a tube size, number of tubes, tube length, tube arrangement, tube spacing and an acceptable pressure on the tube side.",8476

Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602

2,"Why do I yawn all the time, I am not even tired? ; I mean I yawn all freaking day! I cant stand it! ; THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, and the one that is taught in medical school, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. \n\nStudies have shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung capacity; for the most part, we just use the air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sacs, called alveoli, don’t get fresh air, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or take a yawn to get more air into the lungs.\n\nBut certain aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning in the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t take oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reasons unclear.\n\nAnother puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn in association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).",8680

1,"Why does vitamin d cause thirst? ; For instance, drinking milk or anything else fortified with vitamin d will only make me more thirsty after 5 or 10 minutes. ; Your experience is interesting!  My first thought is as follows:  Vitamin D inhibits the renin-angiotensin system which plays a role in fluid balance (and therefore blood pressure) in the body.  You may have a genetic polymorphism (variation) creating a 'hypersensitivity' to vitamin D in this system.  However, if Vitamin D is really the cause of your thirst response, does exposure to sunlight also produce this effect in 5 or 10 minutes?  Lastly, I would expect it to take longer than 5 or 10 minutes for any vitamin D consumed to actually get into your blood stream.\n\nSo....if I haven't confused you by now, I guess the best answer I can offer is....

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788

Therefore\n\nx = (1/y) (-y^2/2 + C), or x = -y/2 + C/y.\n\nMultiply through by 2y: 2xy + y^2 = 2C, which is equivalent to the solution you expect, since C is an arbitrary constant.\n\n2. Since n=2, let v = y^(1-n) = 1/y.  After transforming, you get \n\ndv/dx + vp(x) = q(x)\n\nwhere p(x) = (1-n)P(x) = 1/x and q(x) = (1-n)Q(x) = x, so you're solving\n\ndv/dx + (1/x)v = x.\n\nNow use the integrating factor x, and  you have\n\nx dv/dx + v = x^2\n\nso (vx)' = x^2, or v = (1/x)(x^3/3 + C), so\n\nv = x^2 / 3 + C/x.  But v = 1/y, so \n\ny = 1 / (x^2/3 + C/x) = x / (x^3/3 + C).\n\nThis doesn't agree with what you're saying the answer should be, but it does satisfy the differential equation (as I confirmed by plugging in this solution), whereas your answer doesn't.",8789

The logic of abortionists leads inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia. Even some pro-abortionists (Joseph Felcher, for example) admit that the two issues are logically tied together. In fact, there would be greater logical justification for taking the life of someone already known to be deformed than one which prenatal tests have simply indicated might be. ; Oh, please state your source.

Are you asking if somone could get into more trouble than normal for not paying their debt when it's in the hundereds of thousands, verus let's say someone with only a few thousands dollars debt?\n\nDebt is debt is debt.  If you take out a credit card, no matter what your credit limit is, you're supposed to pay it back according to the terms of the credit card company.  If you don't, the credit card company has a couple of different options.  For a small amount, they could simply write the debt off on their taxes at the end of the year and forget it.  Or, they could sell the debt to someone else, and the someone else could try to collect it (phone calls, letters, etc).  In either case, it's probably going to show up on your credit report, and your credit would suffer the normal 7 years.  In some cases, these ""debt buyers"" post the debt as of the day they buy it, and it could stay on your credit for alot longer than just 7 years.\n\nThe credit card company could also take you to small claims court (depending on how much you owe and what the limit for your state is) and get a judgment.  Here's where things get tricky.

Yes, I know what it is, and no, I can't say that I've ever seen any of the hundreds of Mormons I've known ever drinking it.  So here's a quick news flash for you: in every religion, you will find disparity between what the religion asks of people and how people actually behave.  In Mormonism, it is regarded that ALL hot beverages--Mormon Tea, Earl Gray, herbal tea, you name it--are to be avoided.  The Word of Wisdom says in D&C 89:9 ""And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.""  Hence, coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or even Postum is something regarded as a bad idea.  Some people in the LDS church have decided to regard this as having been orginally stated because the most prominent hot drinks--coffee and tea--have caffiene, and they've decided to regard this as an indirect prohibition of caffiene-loaded drinks, while thinking things like hot apple cider or hot cocoa or Postum are okay, while Jolt, Coke, and Red Bull, though not hot, are still to be avoided; but the specific text of the LDS doctrine does not agree with that assertion.\n\nBut more importantly, what's the big deal about Mormon Tea?  Yes, it has ephedra in it, but only a teensy tiny amount of it.  There aren't any ephedra junkies lurking in ally ways trying to prostitute themselves out for a bag of Mormon Tea.  And ephedra does have some good medicinal applications, especially for people with breathing issues.  So why are you getting all bent out of shape?\n\nPS: worry less about the eating and drinking habits of Mormons and maybe focus on your grammatical skills instead.\n\nCheers.",8862

6,"CAPM in China? ; Hello,\nIm writing a paper why the CAPM doesn`t work in CHina. I need a mathematical example with the simple CAPM-equation to show it. I don`t know what I should use as the riskfree rate. So my question is whar should I use and do you know a good example or other reasons why it doesnt work? ; First of all the extension of the original CAPM(Sharpe, Mossin,\nLintner in 1963) is termed the International CAPM or ICAPM.\nTo use it in china you need a beta for the stock or for a portolio of \nstocks which will be difficult for some of the newly formed \nChinese publically traded corporations.  Another factor is the\nstock market in China is an emerging market hence it suffers from a general lack of history and liquidity though expectation is that it will grow rapidly in the future.  \n\nThe model would be:R stock = risk free rate+Beta (Rmarket-RF)\n\n  Now in the literature it is common to use either the \nU.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the U.S. Long Bond Rate. As \nRoll's critique aptly pointed out there is no truely riskless asset\nso we have used the above surrogates. Not a bad choice though since the data on them is readily available through the U.S. \nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which issues these debt \nobligations through the Fed has never defaulted on any obligations.  Further the marke is the largest most liquid debt \nmarket in the world which has investors from around the world and foreign governments buying and selling these assets \ncontinuously.   \n\nSo, next we address the matter of a market index surrogate\nto use in the right hand terms.  Since we can't really use the \nChinese swtock market Index as a true surrogate for the \nworld market index we must make one.  Assuming there is \nadequate capital market integration today to allow us to do so.\nIn the literature some have use a weighted average composite\nconsisting ofweights determined by the relative market values \nof equity traded on the diverse major wold bourses(Stock Markets).  For example the portion of equity traded in the NY\nStock market weighted by an index like the S& P 500 index\nalong with the proportion of stocks traded in London weighted \nby the FTS Index.  Gradually if you consider all the major \nmarkets today such as Tokyo, Paris, London, New York,\nCanada TSE, etc.,\nyou'll be able to compute a suitable weighted average \nRORmrkt. \n\nThe major problem you need to ovwercome in any emerging market like China is thin market trading--translation too few stocks are quoted and trading activity in them takwes too long to \nprovide investors /money managers with enough information\nderived from each successive buy-sell combination). \n\n\n  Assuming you did find an adequately traded stock with enough \nhistory in the Chinese stock market, and you did compute a \nworld market index surrogate for the market index along \nwith selecting a risk free asset such as by using the U.S. \nT Bill Yield, then you could use the equation to correctly \nprice the Chinese stock in terms of its rate of return.\n\nAssume further that you average the returns on the world market\nindexes and it turns out to be 12%.\n\nNext regress the Chinese stock past returns (having converted from Yen capital gains and dividends) againtst the historical \nworld market stock index levels for the same number of observations as you have on the Chinese stock (note: the data \nmust be aligned so that they are matched for the same time periods as those of the Chinese stock'sprice observations. \nIn other words the matched pairs must be contemperaneous with one another. You should use say weekly, monthly close \ndata and with the problem I described earlier I would use the \nlater time interval for obserfvations.  \n\nThe coefficient of this OLS simple regression is the Beta\non the stock.  Assume it is 1.5 positive.\n\n    If we assume a yield on the U.S. T Bill of 5%, the math \nthen is  Stock ROR% = 5% + 1.5(10%-5%) = 5%+7.5%= 12%\n\nThere's the heart of your paper...now gety busy and write it.\n\nTry doing a dogpile or other search for academic journal, textbooks on international finance, and other sources.",8877

He heard a voice that was supposedly God and had someone else write it down. He is the only person that can confirm the voice, the only person that heard it, so he is the only active voice in the Koran. They explain the actions of what middle eastern people use to do when they were idolitors and heathans by saying that they just got confused and it was really done ""this way"" by Abraham or Moses or... etc for this and that reason. They pray five times a day. One of the two I know HATES white people... and ctually hates almost everything. He says that if it is not good and he can not make it good, then hate it because that is the right thing to do. He would be an extremist I guess. My other friend that is a Muslim is the most loving, easy spirit you would ever meet. \n\nNow, I know this sounds like ignorant babble, but please help. Please no hateful or uninformative ranting. Thanks! ; You've almost got it. :) God sent angel Gabriel (""Jibreel"" in Arabic) to Muhammad peace be upon him, to relay the Message (The Quran/Koran). So in every case, he got the Message from the angel.\n\nThe Quran is ""The Words of God/Allah"" to Muhammad, to tell the people.\n\nYes, prayer, the one involving prostration (called ""Salat"" or ""salah"") is five times a day. It is good for the body, did you know that oprah and ""experts"" and the like say we should meditate five times a day? coincidence? Well, I do believe it is healthier and more in tune with God to ""visit"" him often, instead of storing it all up for Sundays don't ya think? :D :D Of course, we can pray in our own words (called ""dua"") any time we want, too.\n\nWell, if you know a Muslim who hates white people, he is likely part of a religion called ""The Nation of Islam (NOI)"" which is actually different from orthodox Islam. NOI take their beliefs from Bible AND Quran. Muslims, only from Quran, recognizing the Bible to have errors and The Quran doesn't. (try reading it! you'll be shocked!) If he's not NOI, then still he is wrong to hate any ""race"", please see proof of that in the Quran itself, at http://muttaqun.com/prejudice.html\n\nPlease begin with a primer on the basic beliefs of a Muslim, at http://muttaqun.com/shahada.html\n\nYou can also read the Quran online at http://muttaqun.com/quran and I highly recommend you use The Noble Quran english translation to get the best translation.

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

9,"Have race relations improved or declined under the Bush presidency? ; Conservatives seem to think that the President is doing a fine job in this regard, citing his appointments of Powell and Rice in particular. What say you? ; Personally I think if you have to cite the fact that you appointed two Black Citizens to such high positions, you did it because you wanted to use that cite.  Don't get me wrong, I think Powell and Rice are highly qualified for the positions, but I'm guessing there are others of many other races that are equals to them.  So either they are better suited to the position (Very Likely) or Bush needed some help and decided to make himself look good while also bringing on highly qualified people (More likely).  I hate to say that, but with everything else the administation has done and the way they spin everything (They aren't the only side doing it might I add) to fit a need makes me question it.\n\nI do think for the most part things have stayed the same, excpet for Muslims which are now viewed as some sort of enemy (A great example of this is Army commercials that feature soldiers watching ""Terrorists"", all of which are wearing turbans and in deserts.\n\nOh and I think Powell quit because he couldn't sacrifice his integrity for Bush.  ""Condie"" has now been made somewhat of a spokesperson, I see her more and more now.  It's also a good way to place blame, even if she didn't write the words, she said them and to most people, whoever said the words is guilty of creating them.  We do the same thing to any other political official good or bad. For example, people giving presidents credit for speeches that they didn't write.  For speaking the way they do takes practice which is also coached, it's more and more common now.  We don't see many Leaders in Washington that are naturally born leaders, the kind that didn't need speech writers.

0,"The ""ELECT"", what  does it mean? ; The Bible talks about the ""elect""....what does this mean to you? Who do you think the ""elect' are?\nIs this the same as the ""chosen""....??? ; In Christianity, the category of ""the elect"" is tricky because it engages theological differences between different strains of Christianity regarding the exact interaction of free will (which is essential to Christian ethics) and God's foreordained determination of all history (which is essential to Christian cosmology), which have appeared at times to some Christian theologians to have a paradoxical relationship.\n\nFor Calvinists, for example, God has chosen the elect at the beginning of time and whether one chooses to embrace Christian salvation or reject it is on one hand a form of free will, but beneath that and more fundamentally is an expression of God's predetermination of all choices.  In the Roman Catholic tradition, the ""elect"" is more oriented toward free will, and means both those chosen by God and those who have chosen God, which are understood to be coextensive spheres.  In the Fundamentalist tradition, the term elect primarily is used to contrast those who are saved with those who are damned, and is a preferentialist term.\n\nYes, elect and chosen are the same in the contemporary Christian context--although the original Biblical meaning of ""the chosen"" had to do with the Jewish people, which is not at all the same as ""the elect.""",8981
0,"WHICH IS SUPERIOR, a culture that forces the separation of the sexes (ISLAM) or a normal culture? ; The is an important question. Muslims believe their culture is superior to all others and that the world should be forced by them to live the same. \n\nMuslims believe in single-sex lifestyles where men and woman are separated as much as possible with the exception of the homeplace of married people. Some Islamic countries even have norms where the separation continues inside the house (separate womans living room, etc).\n\nCould this be the superior culture? Is it better for the world to banish female beauty from public? What happens when men are forced to spend so much time together, does incest and homosexuality rates explod like in all Islamic countries?\n\nMuslims usually answer this with a question ""You want someone looking at YOUR sister or mother!!"" \n\nIf I viewed my mother or sister as possessions, as opposed to humans without needs and free will, then I suppose I would cover them like furniture or put them in storage but I would now be worried about uncle Ali's incest. ; Like anybody is really going to read your rant.

2,"how do u know when ur bipolar and what can a 14 year old girl do to get help? ; i need to know this answer bad... ; Well, first you need to look at your family history.  Has anyone in your family ever been bipolar or had bipolar tendencies?  If so, then here's the second question:  Are you ADD or ADHD?\n\nHere's my personal story:\n\nI started my period at 11.  By 13 I hit ""teenager"" years and by 14 I was into puberty.  You know, boobs, hair, voice, the works.  Except something happened.  I turned into Frankenstein's Mood monster.  I was always either really excited and upbeat, or so depressed that I would stay in my room for days and bite off anyone's head who tried to talk to me.\n\nMy family became so distraut that they finally talked about sending me to a boarding school.  the house was always tense, but I thought it was everyone else.  I was kicked out several times, moved back home, and just barely made it through my teen years without going crazy.  When I was 21, I married, and my husband saw the same thing in me - we were always fighting, and I knew it was always my fault.  I felt crazy because my moodswings were so bad.\n\nAfter lots of research and lots of crazy doctors trying to prescribe me medicines, I learned the most facinating thing:  Kids who are ADD or ADHD and go through puberty actually experience bipolar tendencies.  It's a natural, hormone-imbalance.  And since I was ADHD my whole life, it was normal.  Man I wish someone had know that back then!!!!!!\n\nHere's what you need to do:  Find out if you're ADD or ADHD.  Change your diet from sugars and white flours to lots of grains, good dark green vegetables, and unprocessed sugars and eat healthy.  Exercise and work out regularly.  Talk to your doctor about natural ways to balance out your hormones through this period.  It's possible.\n\nIt's okay, you're going to be alright.  You'll make it through this, even though now it doesn't seem like it. \n\nIf it is bipolar, you would have known at an early age, before this time.  Since you're 14 and starting to experience these symptoms, I would say most likely it's that your hormones are turning you into a woman.  Hang in there, girl!",9004

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

1,"Memetic evolution? ; Need references and opinions on whether this realy is the new DNA. ; Memes are things passed down culturally from one generation to the next such as religion.  Memetic evolution is the change of cultural customs that are passed down from generation to generation over time.  Memes are not a form of DNA at all and are just mental thoughts that are passed down verbally or otherwise over time. Memes exist, but there are no genes or DNA involved in memetic evolution.  So this is not the new DNA, but is a reference referring to the fidelity with which culture is passed on from one generation to the next.\n\nThe term meme was coined by Oxford evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book, ""The Selfish Gene"", which I believe was first published around 1973.  Any Dawkins text would serve as a good source to study memes or memetic evolution.  Just type Dawkins or meme into any search engine and you should be able to find a good amount of information on the subject.  \nThe books that I read by Dawkins that cover the topic are: The Ancestor's Tale, The Selfish Gene, and The Devil's Chaplain.",9017

So for you sister her ""ideal"" weight would be 140lbs.  Keep in mind that this is just a guideline.  Other factors which will affect this are genetics, bone structure and muscle mass.  Small bone structure will obviously weight less.  And since muscle weighs more than fat, a more muscular person will weigh more than the same physical size person with a higher % bodyfat.  My guess is your sister sounds like she is pretty thin, with a small bone structure and not much muscle mass.

2,"Do fat people get stomach aches? ; I know when I eat too much I get a stomach ache ; Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found new clues to how the brain and the stomach interact with emotions to cause overeating and obesity. By looking at how the human brain responds to ""fullness"" messages sent to the brain by an implanted device that stimulates the stomach, the scientists have identified brain circuits that motivate the desire to overeat in the obese -- the same circuits that cause addicted individuals to crave drugs. The scientists have also verified that these circuits play a critical role in eating behaviors linked to soothing negative emotions. The study appears in the October 17, 2006 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published online in PNAS Early Edition the week of October 2.\n\nThis study opens new territory in understanding how the body and brain connect to each other, and how this connection is tied to obesity,"" said lead author Gene-Jack Wang of Brookhaven Lab's Center for Translational Neuroimaging.

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146
2,"New job and a persistant bacterial infection dilema... read for more details? ; I got sick on October 16th and ended up in the ER unable to breathe and was throwing up.  The doctor examined me and said I had a bacterial infection of my lungs, sinuses, larynx, and ears.  He prescribed z-pak and I was sent home for a week of bed rest.  The next week I returned to my full time student status at the local university with a still really run down feeling.  Being optimistic, I reinterviewed for my old job as a seasonal full time employee (Circuit City).  That weekend, I started once again feeling horrible and returned to urgent care on Monday.  The doctor this time prescribed Levaquin.  After I took it for 4 days, I pretty much lost the ability to focus my eyes and to keep down anything but yogurt.  I finished my prescription neverless since my doctor said it wasn't an allergic reaction.  I finished my pills this past Friday and was offered a job on Saturday.  Again, I am prematurely optimistic because my symptoms are once again returning.  I'm suppose to start work ; Run, don't walk somewhere that sells good probiotics.(any health food store will have them in their fridge, if you can't find them ask)\n  You have had two major rounds of antibiotics. ABX  nuke all the bacteria in your system, including the good ones.  The ""bad"" ones tend to reproduce more quickly than the ones that are beneficial to us. To rebuild those quicker than the ones that cause problems, you help them out by orally taking some. \nAcidolpholus and bifidus are two of them. There is lactobaccilus as well as a handful of others. If there are 3 or 4  kinds, that's not a bad thing.\n I take them on a semi regular basis, as well as any time I have taken ABX in the last 10 years. If I don't, I get sinus and yeast infections for weeks afterward.\nThe way to figure out if your probiotics are still alive is to break a capsule into a little cup of milk and leave it in the fridge over night. If it's thick like yogurt in the morning, they're good. If not, if it's thin like milk, then they aren't working any more.  A bottle at the health food store should run between $10-15. . \nYou'll need to go to a health food store or order online to get good probiotics. Get the kind that have to be refrigerated, not tablets that don't have to be kept cold.  The ones that have to be kept cold are better quality.\nIn addition to taking probiotics, eat less simple carbs. There is a ""candida diet"" out there that is supposed to help your body not support candida overgrowth, which is what multiple or recurring  infections sounds like to me, esp when more than one round of ABX is involved. I'm not a doc, I've just been there too many times before I found out about probiotics.\nThat diet I mentioned, cuts out simple carbs, and limits complex carbs at first. Then you find your own balance that your body can tolerate. \nhere are a couple of links to different varieties of that diet...\nhttp://altmedicine.about.com/od/popularhealthdiets/a/candidadiet.htm\nhttp://candidapage.com/candiet.txt\n  \nhth",9147

However, i was a shy boy (though still is) and the fact is that she had boyfriends one after another THROGHT OUT the teen years. and God know how many times i felt sour and my heart sank whenever i saw her with her guy(s).\n\nDuring the poly years, i had a girlfriend and she was having a relatively more committed relationship. so my heart was with my girl at the time and hence u can only say that i have been a secret admirer ""on-and-off"" for 10 years.\n\nOFF, is when i have a gf, my heart have no one else. and even when i'm single, i won't fall for a girl who is attached.\n\nON, is for the times when we were both unattached. it kind of give me hope bcoz she is available. For the past 10 years, i never take any action for these ""on"" periods. \n\nFor the past 2 months, we kind of reconnect our communication. Bcoz i'm studying in uni now and she is working, we have chance to chat for few hours daily on MSN. (mon-fri working hours only though, coz she don't usually use msn at home)\n\nFrom recent chats, \nshe told me that she is now single, and she mentioned that she is not a late-queen for dates nowadays. \nAnd after she know that i used to have one painful and hurtful relationship, she said that ppl have to move on and ""if there's a good girl whom u like then give it a try"" \nShe also claims that she only regard herself who had only 2 relationships coz sec sch histores are just childish ones.\n\nWe talked a lot rubbish, shared a lot of views, joked a lot and ""suan"" each other a lot and i feel (or maybe only i feel)that we start to have some connection.\n\nSo, last week, i managed to find some courage a said.. \n\n""you wrote on my sec sch autograph book that i can call u anytime, so.. can i call u tonight??"" \n\nbut she replied ""lol.. i have a dinner appointment tonight."" \n\nI was rather disappointed. I thought, if she doesn't mind me calling she would have state a time or sth. \n\nBut soon after, she said ""next time we catch up with a movie, after your exam?"", ""when your exam finish?"", ""talk is cheap, fix a date now""....\n\nso, our tentative date (or sec sch class monitor-monitress re-union if putting it mildly) is 3 dec!! just 2 days aft my exam. But the point is that we only chat on MSN and have not advanced into phone-talk and constant sms-es.\n\nI keep thinking of her recently. and thinking..\nShd i postpone it? coz i just had a bad haircut.\nwhat shd i say? how shd i behave? will i just blush and panic? is that anything in my walldrode that can match her smile and style? shd i pay for everything? where shd we eat?? It's not like i don't have experience.\nAlthough i had gf before. But this time is different. She is a special person to me. (else i won't admire her for a decade\nSo now i'm like completely anxious and excited at the same time.\n\nShe is a very pretty girl to me. i looked at her that way for the past 10 years. so it's not like i'm saying this coz she is grown up now and having her own fashion taste.\n\nBut i have a low esteem of myself. coz i don't think i have the look. and that i'm just a poor student who owes the bank loan of $18k.\n\nThe tough point here for me is: \nIS there another guys who express interest in her?\nDOES she already has someone in mind?\nwhen shd i tell her my feelings? the feelings that have been kept inside me for 10 years?\nShould i buy her a present (and say it's christmas present) for that day?\nShould i just write a love letter and confess everything? (probably not coz she might freak out)\nWhat shd we do after movie?\nOR.. after all, she might actually just take it at friendship level and that i am thinking way too much?\n\nI feel that, sooner or later, i have  ; wOW!  Are you British?  It is of no consequence, or course, but the more I read the more you sounded like someone from the U.K. \nAnyway, in some ways it is sweet that you have admired this lady for so long.  The romantic female side of me thinks it has great potential to be a wonderful love story.  That's the problem.  Love stories are just that..stories.  In reality you sound like a stalker.  It is just not that serious for this girl.  She probably sees you as an old school chum she would not mind spending an evening with sometime.  \n\nIt seems to me that you need to move on with your life and get out more.  Consider it just a date.  I thought only women thought things through this deeply when it came to relationships.  Hearing a man confess to such flights of whimsy (the gift, the love note confession, et' all) is a little creepy to be honest.  Sensitive is nice, obsessive is just creepy.  You sound obsessive, or at least quite immature and inexperienced.  Almost a stereotype of, well, an engineering student.  \n\nDon't confess undying love.  Don't buy a gift.  Don't write the love note.  Don't sweat the haircut.  Just pick her up.  Take her to dinner, enjoy the moment, escort her home and tell her you'd like to see her again.  \n\nYou've waited 10 years, so you have time.  Get to know her.  Hopefully she lives up to the fantasy you've created all these years. \n\nGood luck.",9151

9,"What are the drawbacks to a form of capitalism built on profit sharing? ; I'm of the opinion that the distribution of wealth in this country is top heavy. 1% of the population controls approximately 90% of the wealth! A lot of this disparity comes from the fact that people work hard for low pay. The owners or stockholders get to keep most of the wealth generated from these peoples' work. What if you were to pass legislation that required businesses to not only pay salaries, but also to share profits. The business owners and stockholders would still get a share of the profits, but now the workers would too. This would certainly inspire workers to try to help the business to work better. I am considering starting a business for the sole purpose of leading by example. To me this could be a revolution of a more socialist form of capitalism.

8,"how can i make my husband realize i love his family same as mine.? ; he always hurt me by saying bad things about my dad though in front of him he is good.when i tell him that this attitude of his hurts me ,he says he is joking,but when the matter of his parents or brothers come,he gets really angry if i say something.though his younger bro had created a huge mess in my inlaws house about me and my parents.my marriage was almost at the verge of breaking but didnt.though my husby knew i was right he didnot support,this was 3yrs back.now i guess he has realized but never tells me openly.but i can understand by his behaiviour.i speak to my brotherinlaws wife but not him.even now after 5 yrs of marriage my inlaws and his family i am not comfortable.they always one or the other way hurt me.but my huby never support me.always says to think about myself him and my daughterand be happy.but i want his family to love me  understand me .we live in seperate country .when ever we go 4 vaccation while comin back a new story .now we r leavin 4 vaccation i am scared. ; Sounds like your husband comes from a rough family and still has some of their bad habits. I wouldn't try to get his family to like you. It's not your fault they are mean. It wouldn't matter how perfect you were, they are just not that good at being nice to others. If I were you, I would remember everything your family has taught you about being a good person and trust that. Just be the best person you were raised to be and maybe your example will help soften them over time. Maybe not. But at least you can be strong knowing that you are doing the right thing even if they are not. Do not judge yourself by their standards. They obviously aren't experts at being decent, so don't take what they say so seriously. Try thinking of them compassionately as children who were not given the right tools and don't know how to behave better. Most of all, be kind to yourself, even if others are not. Talk kindly to yourself and think about all your good qualities. When you are feeling hurt try to be patient with them. Remember, they can only hurt your feelings if you believe what they say. Make yourself strong and calm inside and you'll be OK. Think positive! Good luck to you!",9262

Is there something to be ashamed about?  So what if you had sexual relations...it's when he starts lying about the details of that sexual relationship then you have a problem.  But women can be pretty good at nipping men in the butt if they chose to reveal details.  Let him know that if he wants to remain civil friends that he should grow up, or else you might just have to let all of your female friends within the common circle of friends know just how pathetic a lover he really is.

Just wondering if anyone else liked it. ; I liked it, I like indie movies, and I really got into it. I thought there was something wrong with Natalie's character though. I think that she was like experiencing some kind of psychological problems, but she was really funny at the same time. She is what Zach's character needed because he was so cold and shut out from the rest of society. His father being so objective of him, and him hurting his mother made him never forgive himself. He was experiencing psychological problems as well, so I think it helped having someone who could relate and not judge him. He never told anyone that he hurt his mother but her, not even any of his other friends. I am just glad that he found true love and came to terms with that it was not his fault that he was an ill child, and that his father stop making him feel worst by treating him like only a patient and not a son. I also liked how he went through all of the hassle he did to get his mother's jewelry back. He really loved her, so overall the movie was good, because in the end everything linked together and made so much sense. I enjoyed it.",9271

9,"Is Italy a Police State? ; I lived in Italy for five years and was repeatly horrified by the brutality of the police there. Italy is a member of the EU and I am shocked that such behavoir is allowed to continue. Whenever this matter is mentioned to higher authorities in the EU they simply say that police brutality in Italy is not within their remit. If the police in the UK acted the same way there would be hell to pay. Why is it not the same in Italy? ; In Genova, Italy 2001,the government of Silvio Berlusconi imposed a veritable police state on tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting against the meetings of the heads of state of the eight leading capitalist powers (the Group of 8). On July 20, carabinieri (paramilitary national police) charged into a peaceful demonstration and as protesters scattered, they shot an “anti-globalization” demonstrator, Carlo Giuliani, in the head, rolled over him twice with a jeep and drove away. It was an execution. \n\nThat night squads of riot police broke into the Diaz school which housed many protesters and the independent media center that was sending out news of the demonstrations. The blood-stained walls recorded the horrors that took place as scores of youth were brutally clubbed and hauled off to holding pens. As they were carrying out the attack, the cops repeatedly shouted “Viva Il Duce!” (Mussolini) and “Viva Pinochet!”",9283

The catch is that most of these groups give grants to churches and charities to spend on providing food and services to the community, not to spend on building their own churches. And of course, government grants are completely out of the question, as that is illegal.\n\nYou might try hitting up a Christian advocacy group for a small donation by claiming to be heading up a grassroots campaign for something they're interested in. Or maybe you can talk some megachurch into sponsoring or adopting you if you're in a disadvantaged area. For the most part, however, churchgoers will contribute money to make their own churches bigger but aren't interested in building churches for people who have already been converted to Christianity. Move your church to Pakistan and they might consider!\n\nBest of luck.",9285

If we fought a military action, I think it would be brief and simple, involving mostly naval and air forces to bomb and destroy Iranian nuclear reactors.\n\nI think the war would also be coalition-based, with UN and EU forces participating.

I know of a few friends who manage this well and am curious to hear from others!  I'm basically just trying to get out of paying out of pocket and I know I can get a Stafford loan because they basically gives those away like candy! ; To get Stafford loans you have to first apply for federal aid (PELL Grant) by filling out a FAFSA (not FASFA) form. \n There are different types of Stafford loans and you can get both. Subsidised stafford loans are not charged interest untill you finish school. Unsubsidised Stafford loans start charging interest as soon as the school gets the money. To get an unsub loan you have to first be denied for a parent plus loan. Parent plus loans your parent signs and has to start paying on the loan I think 6 months after the school gets the money.\n Each stafford loan you get you will have to start paying on six months after you stop atending college.

This is the problem my mom is flexible she will do lunch or dinn ; My mother-in-law told my husband and I she was not doing Thanksgiving or Christmas this year because of money, because her diabetes is getting worse and because she is tired of her son eating and running.

He tried to explain that the seating just isn't there and she said we'd have to make our own plans.  Now she is doing nothing but laying guilt trips on him and it's working...to a point.  She will never change.  Part of it is because she is selfish and needy, though perfectly capable.

One thing to look at before jumping into one of the is the accredation of the company offering the course(s).

2,"What causes enlarged tastebuds, and how do they form? ; I thought perhaps it was a matter of tongue damage and subsequent swelling, but it seems daft that if you burn or bite your tongue, only one bud would swell up. I've also dismissed the idea of it being hormonal, because if that were the case, teenagers would have a lot more of them, and post-menopausal women a lot less. So does anyone actually know what's up? ; A swollen taste bud can be caused by a number of things. Very hot food that burns and irritates a taste bud can cause swelling. Allergies to specific foods can also cause it. Taste buds that taste sweets are located on the tip of the tongue and salt taste buds are in the two side areas of the tongue tip. Sour taste buds are situated on the lateral sides of the tongue and bitter taste buds on the back. The area of the tongue where the swollen taste bud is located can be a sign of which taste is involved.\n\nA swollen taste bud can occur from continually eating spicy foods which constantly overstimulate these sense organs. Trauma from biting the tongue can result in taste bud swelling.\n\nIf you need more information on your enlarged taste buds, you can go to the following web site:  http://www.atlantadentist.com/swollen_taste_bud.html\n\nAlso this site has an e-mail link and a phone number you can use to contact them and ask any more questions you may have.\n\nHope this helps you out :-)",9415

WHen the ball bounces back up it gains potential energy and kinetic energy.  In a perfect system with no friction, Pe + Ke at any given time would remain a constant number.

However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

6,"On a bad debt unpaid(auto repo) can a collections agency or lawayer collect when it has been nearly 10 yrs. ? ; The wife of the husband was sold the vehicle and she had no job. The husband (now x-husand) for many years, he never paid the lst. paymnet.Eventually, it was repo. The dealer ship, collection agencies, now a lawyer has harrassed her for many years for the loss of resale. Can they collect or sue her for this balance?  Could she sue them for harrassement? She has a call from a lawyer's office regarding this which seemed odd. No registered mail has come.She has been a single mom for years and limited income. Please help us with this situation. ; Here are a couple thoughts.\n\nFirst, the FCC and FCRA (fair credit reporting act) both have something to say about harassing phone calls.  There are only certain times during the day when collection agencies and their affiliates are allowed to call a debtor.  Furthermore, they are not allowed to contact a debtor at work or on a cell phone (assuming that the debtor has dutifully informed them that the number is a cell or work number).  She can easily file a complaint with the FCC about the harassing behaviour if these companies aren't complying with the regulations.\n\nThis person needs to look up the statute of limitations for collecting a debt in her area (or for the area in which she lived when the contract was signed).  My understanding is that a business is legally entitled to try to collect on a debt forever and there isn't a statue of limitations.  However, if this person was married during the time or was under 18, she may be able to prove that it isn't her debt legally, allowing her to stop collection efforts.\n\nAlso, any type of communication that this person has with these agencies or their affiliates is voluntary unless she's been given legal notice.  That being the case, I recommend that she simply ignore them and they'll go away because it's just not worth their time to keep bothering you.  They'll write off the debt before too long.\n\nSuing the companies for harassment would just aggrivate the situation and cost her time and money which, presumably, she can't afford.\n\nFinal suggestion:\n- Contact a local consumer assistance hotline.  You might be able to find one by contacting your local PIRG (USPIRG site: http://www.uspirg.org/)\n- Obtain copies of her credit report from all three CRAs and determine if anything has been posted regarding this debt.  If applicable, follow the CRAs requirements for having the debt removed if it was reported.",9505

4,Why do ebayers bid on items days before it ends? ; Ebay auctions are about bids but don't bidders have more of a chance to win if they wait till the end or maybe even sniping at the last second? Is there a strategy Im not seeing here with this method by letting their interest been known early on? ; Sometimes I see an item and I already know the maximum amount I would pay and I bid accordingly early on because I may not be able to get back to it or remember it when it ends.  Other times I do hold off till the last few seconds.  The latter is a lot of fun if you know you're going to be there when it ends.  Also sometimes I like to bid early hoping others will pass it by when they see the item already has a bid.  It just depends on the item and the price and the starting bid.,9513

I can't answer your first question because quite frankly i couldn't care less, however Man Utd are the richer of the clubs although they are now under a massive debt thanks to Malcolm Glaser their new owner. I don't think this will necessarily hurt Alex Fergusons spending, however with rumours of Henry going to Barcelona Arsenal may have more money too spend this summer. Man Utd are only really missing a midfield maestro to replace the chasm left by Roy Keane so wont need to bring in too many players.\n\nBelieve me if the players are good enough a manager will not care where they come from.\n\nAt Liverpool we have 2 Malians in the first team and a 17 year old Ghanain in the reserves.

A non-profit corporation plows all the money it makes beyond salaries and operating expense either back into the business or distributes the money for a charitable purpose.\n\nA non-profit is defined by its tax status, not by whether or not it brings in a lot of money.

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.  This requires crunches but sit ups will work if you don't have access to a machine.\n\nYou could try taking creatine ester.  It causes your existing muscles to swell a little bit.  It might make you look a little better in the two weeks.  You get it at the health food store.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to tone and increase your build, you need to join a gym because its really difficult to do it without machines.  Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

The amount of alcohol it takes to lose consciousness won't be the same for a 98lb person as it is for a 250lb person.\n\nAlcohol is metabolized by the liver, where enzymes break down the alcohol. Understanding the rate of metabolism is critical to understanding the effects of alcohol. In general, the liver can process one ounce of liquor (or one standard drink) in one hour. If you consume more than this, your system becomes saturated, and the additional alcohol will accumulate in the blood and body tissues until it can be metabolized. This is why pounding shots or playing drinking games can result in high blood alcohol concentrations that last for several hours.\n\nThe Blood Alcohol Educator is an interactive way to look at BAC levels.

6,"For landlords if a tenant is late with the rent how soon do you contact them? ; Do you call them right away and say hey where is my money or do you just send a late notice after so many days? ; Personally if they are newer tenants I'm at their door on the second of the month asking where the rent is.  If I do that a couple of times they seem to get the message.\n\nBe careful with late payment fees.  Many states control the earliest you can charge them and how much you can charge.  I too tried the idea of a discount if rent is received by the first and a small claims judge ruled that it was a transparent late fee that was charged too early, cost me about $225 including court costs.\n\nIf the tenant isn't on a lease (which I never do) and they are often late - raise the rent.\n\nIn my humble experience leases only protect the tenant and provide the landlord very little advantage.  The tenants usually don't have that much to lose, and it's not worth my time to chase them for less that $1,500",9625

Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

5,"What is the longest home run ball ever hit?? ; Go Tigers!!! ; Their really isn't one correct answer to this question, I'll try to explain. I’ll start with the home run that Mickey Mantle hit at Griffith Stadium in Washington on April 17, 1953. The entire baseball world was led to believe the ball had traveled 565 feet from home plate to the point where it landed.\nIn truth, that figure derived from the distance from home plate to the place where a neighborhood child retrieved the ball. However, the actual distance in the air was probably about 510 feet (most sources still have this as #1). The same process happened again with Mantle on September 10, 1960 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit when a ball he hit was reported to have traveled 643 feet but it is readily apparent once again that the ball had bounced several times before it reached the estimated distance (this is the home run that the ""Guinness Book of Records"" has as #1). When your talking about tape measure home runs you can’t leave out Babe Ruth. It was said that Ruth once hit one 587 feet in an exhibition game against the Giants back in 1919. Also his tremendous blow to right-center field in Detroit on June 8, 1926, has often been reported as traveling 628 feet, but again was it measured where it first landed or where it came to a rest. Included among the other great exaggerations in the history of tape measure home runs are Dave Nicholson’s Comiskey Park rooftopper on May 6, 1964 who’s shot was calculated at 573 feet. The calculations were on the assumption that the ball traveled completely over the left-center-field roof. However, subsequent\ninvestigation indicated that the ball landed on the back of the roof before bouncing out into the night. Also, when Dave Kingman launched his wind-aided blow in Chicago’s Wrigley Field on April 14, 1976, ""The New York Times"" somehow concluded that it had flown 630 feet. It has been confirmed that the ball struck against the third house beyond Waveland Avenue, which is situated about 530 feet from home plate. Yet another claim (by the ""Guinness Book of Records""), has a minor league player by the name of Roy Edward ""Dizzy"" Carlyle having hit one 618 feet at Emeryville Ball Park, CA on July 4, 1929. Mark McGwire hit several home runs over 500 feet and one over 540 and his is measured accurately every time he hits one. I know I didn’t cover everything but I hope I covered enough to satisfy you.\n\nAlso, Mantle's home run off the facade at Yankee Stadium on May 22, 1963 traveled between 370 to 374 feet and was between 115 to 117 feet high. If it was still going up like some people claim it would have traveled an estimated distance of 620 feet if left unimpeded. However, the reality is that the ball was already on its way down, and those reporting the trajectory were victimized by a common optical illusion. It is a scientific fact that if Mantle, or anyone else, had sufficient strength to hit a ball that was still traveling upward when it met the towering facade, he would also have enough strength to clear that same facade by a distance of at least 100 feet. In order for the ball to be rising at roof level, it would have to have been traveling at a lower angle than that which produces maximum distance. If Mantle had provided the same power or velocity, but had launched the ball at a higher and more efficient angle, it would have passed out of Yankee Stadium at a height of over 200 feet! Mantle hit the facade on two or perhaps three occasions, but never cleared it.\nSource(s):\nYou can also go to:\n\nhttp://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/ar...",9694

I've been studying and teaching Shotokan Karate for over 20 years and I can tell ya that the ""side benefits"" are way more important than just being able to fight. \n   In my personal opinion, it is the self confidence I have gained through training that is the greatest thing to me. By this, I don't mean that I'm arrogant. I don't go around bragging about my ability, I don't go looking for fights, and I can't catch bullets with my teeth. What I mean is that if a situation does arise, I KNOW I can handle it. \n   You take on a different viewpoint when you know that you can really hurt someone...when you know that you could break bones, cripple or kill someone if you really had to. The question becomes ""Was what this guy did REALLY worth hurting him that badly? Does he REALLY deserve that?""\n   So, when some loudmouth ticks you off and insults you or your siginficant other, you have the self confidence to walk away. You know you could go hand him his butt on a silver platter, but you don't HAVE to just to prove a point to yourself. When some immature clown says, ""Hey, you take Karate...show me something!"" you know you don't have to get into a sparring match just to prove to them that you are good. \nYou get to that point when you don't feel you have anything else to prove to yourself, and you certainly don't have to prove anything to anyone else. A sort of serenity sets in when you realize that life is not a competition where you win when you are the absolute best and everyone knows it. You're good.....you're good enough that you can deal with something BAD if it should happen. That's all that matters.",9727

Volume occupied by one mol of gas is 22.4 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP: 760 mmHg and 273 K (0 C))\nTo find the volume of gas that weighs 2.57 g at STP, use formula: P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2, where R is 0.08206, P1=319 mmHg, V1=2 L, T1=298 K; P2=760 mmHg, T2=273 K and V2 is unknown (it will be somewhat less than 1 L).\nAfter you get this volume, see how many mols do you have in it: divide 22.4 by V2 you just got. Then multiply this number by 2.57 and get the molecular mass of your compound (M(X)).\n\n2. Multipy M(X) separately by 0.6481, 0.136 and 0.2159 to get number of atomic weight units that are allocated to C, H, and O respectively. \nThen divide first number by 12, 2nd by 1 and 3rd by 16 to see how many atoms it amounts to.

1,"two physics questions, if you could help me step by step that'd be great since my teacher doesn't teach. ; 1) A clerk moves a box of cans down an aisle by pulling on a rope attached to the box. The clerk pulls with a force of 188 N at an angle of 25.0° with the horizontal. The box has a mass of 36.9 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between box and floor is 0.450. Find the acceleration of the box.\n\n2)A box of books weighing 259 N is shoved across the floor by a force of 435 N exerted downward at an angle of 35° below the horizontal. \n\n(a) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.57, how long does it take to move the box 9 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n(b) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.75, how long does it take to move the box 7 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n--what do the symbols even mean.... so yeah im really lost if u guys could explain how to do these probs so i know in the future, i'd appreciate it a lot. thanks ; 1) The angle of the rope needs to be considered to calculate horizontal and vertical components of the clerk's force. \nFh = 188*cos(25) = 170 N This is what pulls the box.\nFv = 188*sin(25) = 79.5 N This actually lifts the box slightly.\n\nThe symbol for coefficient of kinetic friction is µk. A lower number makes it easier to move the box - if you spilled some olive oil on the floor µk would perhaps go to 0.1. N is normal force. If this was on a slope, normal would be different from weight, but the floor here is level so N = W? \n\nActually no. Because the rope pulls up on the box slightly, the normal force pressing the box to the floor is less than the box's full weight. The box's weight = m*g = 36.9 kg*9.8 m/s^2 = 362 N. The vertical component of the tension in the rope relieves 79.5 N of that so N = 362 - 79.5 N = 282 N. \n\nSo Ff = .450*282 N = 127 N is the force that friction fights with. The horizontal portion of the clerk's pull is 170 N. So there is 43 N left over to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law says\nF = m*a\n43 N = 36.9 kg*a\nso a = 1.17 m/s^2\n\n2) Here the force is directed down at an angle so the vertical component of the force will add to the normal force used in calculating the friction.\nFh = 435 N*cos(35) = 356 N\nFv = 435 N*sin(35) = 250 N\n\nN = the weight of the box + Fv = 259 N + 250 N = 509 N\n\na) Ff = µk*N = .57* 509 N = 290 N This is not enough to hold the box stationary so 356 - 290 N = 66 N are available to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law again:\nBut first we need the box's mass. W = m*g\nm = W/g = 259/9.8 N = 26.4 kg. Now\nF = m*a\n66 N = 26.4 kg*a\na = 66/26.4 m/s^2 = 2.5 m/s^2\n\nThis is getting complicated. To move 9 m will take t seconds:\nx = (1/2)*a*t^2 Solve for t.\n\nb) Ff = µk*N = .75* 509 N = 381 N This is more than the horizontal portion of the clerk's push, so the box will resist. The answer is 0.",9800

Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came to Earth in an attempt catch Zeus with the nymphs.\n\nEcho wanted to save her nymph friends, so she talked to Hera incessantly in order to distract her and allow time for Zeus and the nymphs to leave. However, Hera eventually interrupted Echo and went into the field where Zeus and the nymphs had been. When she saw the field was empty, Hera realized what Echo had done and punished her.\n\nOvid's version of events states that Zeus employed Echo to occupy Hera whilst he continued with his adulteries. Hera soon saw through this ruse and punished her so that she could say only the last words of other people's sentences (echolalia). She could not speak of her own accord and so was deprived of the thing she loved the most.\n\nIn the time of Echo's suffering, there was a human named Narcissus. He was so handsome that every girl or boy that saw him immediately fell in love with him. But Narcissus had no heart, and loved no one.\n\nOne day, Echo met Narcissus and, like every other girl and boy, fell in love with him. Echo could not speak to him, but she had felt she needed to see him. So Echo followed him, just enough to see him, but not enough to be seen.\n\nNarcissus became lost and called out, ""Is anyone here?""\n\nEcho said, ""Here, here, here.""\n\nNarcissus told whoever was there to come out. Echo came out and, because she couldn't talk, used her hands to show Narcissus how much she loved him. Narcissus, annoyed that so many people liked him, rejected her love. Echo, heart-broken, prayed to Aphrodite for death. Her prayer was answered, but Aphrodite loved her voice, so she let her voice live on.",9804

0,"For those who believe in Jesus Christ.? ; If Jesus died for ALL your sins why do you still have to go to confession. ; Good question. \nLet me see if I can explain.\n\nOkay sin is all sin, but there are 2 ""kinds"" of sin. There is sin and then there are sins (plural).\n\nAll sin seperates us from God becasue God is perfect and he can't be with sin. So sin always blocks us from him.\n\nWhen we are born, we are born in sin, therefore sin is in our hearts. (To put it another way, we have a root of sin in us) That is why we need to be saved. When we accept Christ, he forgives us and that root (sin) is gone. We are completely forgiven, and we recieve access to God. That is what salvation is.\n\nHowever, even though we are forgiven and saved, we still mess up sometimes because we are human and we're not perfect. In other words, we commit sins. The sins we commit will not keep us out of heaven (becasue we have been saved)but they will keep us from God (because all sin does that). They get in the way of our faith and hinder our prayers. (For example have you ever messed up and felt guilty, then you were hesitant to pray because of the guilt?) Those sins will always get in our way, but as soon as we confess them to God, he forgives them and takes them away. Then the block is gone and he is free to continue moving in our lives. \n\nSo think of it this way, we are saved when we accept Christ, so we no longer have to worry about going to hell. But confession helps us to maintain a good relationship with our father.\n\nLook at it this way. If you have a child, you will love your child no matter what. Hopefully you would discipline your child, but you would never seriously harm them, and you would always protect them to the best of your ability. But if the child decided to rebel, run away from home, and ""live a life of sin,"" it would be harder for you to protect the child, and the child would get hurt along the way. On the other hand, if the child was obediant and respectful to you, it would be easier and the child would be better off (safer, better taken care of becuase you would have the ability to provide better in that case). But you would still love the child either way right. In the same way, God loves us no matter what we do, but as we confess our sins and obey him, we give him more ability to care for us better. If we run away and rebel, he still loves us, but we are on our own to sufer the consequenses that go with the sin we commit. So obviously the best thing for us is to confess and stay close to our father, so that we may recieve the full protection and benefits. (Plus from the parent perspective that's what He wants us to do becasue he wants to care for us closely.)\n\nOf course how you confess is between you and God. Ultimately God is the only one you have to answer to. However confessing to others (whom you trust) often does help becasue it helps us to ""walk in the light"" and avoid sin. I personally have never been to a formal confession, but I have benefited alot from accountibility partners and groups. In other words I have turned to trusted friends and confessed to them when I needed to. They in turn prayed for me and encouraged me, helping me get through things I needed to get through in life. I would definately suggest hooking up with a person or small group where you can do this.",9812

The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4.  Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business",9819

Some argue that it's a mutation, but if that's so then why is o-neg the universal blood. Others say it was the original blood factor, but why then is there no rheses strain in it? Any idea's or info? ; Rh Blood Types\n\n\nRh click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced blood types were discovered in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener.  This was 40 years after Landsteiner had discovered the ABO blood groups.  Over the last half century, we have learned far more about the processes responsible for Rh types.  This blood group may be the most complex genetically of all blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cells that are controlled by 2 closely linked genes on chromosome 1.\n\nThe Rh system was named after rhesus click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced  monkeys, since they were initially used in the research to make the antiserum for typing blood samples.  If the antiserum agglutinates your red cells, you are Rh+ click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  If it doesn't, you are Rh- click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  Despite its actual genetic complexity, the inheritance of this trait usually can be predicted by a simple conceptual model in which there are two alleles, D and d.  Individuals who are homozygous dominant (DD) or heterozygous (Dd) are Rh+.  Those who are homozygous recessive (dd) are Rh- (i.e., they do not have the key Rh antigens).\n\nClinically, the Rh factor, like ABO factors, can lead to serious medical complications. The greatest problem with the Rh group is not so much incompatibilities following transfusions (though they can occur) as those between a mother and her developing fetus.  Mother-fetus incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh- (dd) and the father is Rh+ (DD or Dd).  Maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells.  The risk increases with each pregnancy.  Europeans are the most likely to have this problem--13% of their newborn babies are at risk.  Actually only about ½ of these babies (6% of all European births have complications.  With preventive treatment, this number can be cut down even further.  Less than 1% of those treated have trouble.  However, Rh blood type incompatibility is still the leading cause of potentially fatal blood related problems of the newborn.  In the United States, 1 out of 1000 babies are born with this condition.\n\nRh type mother-fetus incompatibility occurs only when an Rh+ man fathers a child with an Rh- mother.  Since an Rh+ father can have either a DD or Dd genotype, there are 2 mating combinations possible:\n\ndrawings of two Punnett squares showing the possible Rh positive mates of an Rh negative woman and the probability of their children being Rh positive--100% if the father is homozygous dominant and 50% if he is heterozygous for this trait\n\nOnly the Rh+ children (Dd) are likely to have medical complications.  When both the mother and her fetus are Rh- (dd), the birth will be normal.\n  \n\ndrawing of a fetus in its mother's uterus; the placenta and the umbilical cord are highlighted\n\nHuman fetus in a mother's uterus\n(the umbilical cord and placenta\nconnect the fetus to its mother)\n \n\nThe first time an Rh- woman becomes pregnant, there usually are not incompatibility difficulties for her Rh+ fetus.  However, the second and subsequent births are likely to have life-threatening problems.  The risk increases with each birth.  In order to understand why first born are normally safe and later children are not, it is necessary to understand some of the placenta's functions.  Nutrients and the mother's antibodies regularly transfer across the placental boundary into the fetus, but her red blood cells usually do not (except in the case of an accidental rupture).  Normally, anti-Rh+ antibodies do not exist in the first-time mother unless she has previously come in contact with Rh+ blood.  Therefore, her antibodies are not likely to agglutinate the red blood cells of her Rh+ fetus.  \n\nPlacental ruptures do occur normally at birth so that some fetal blood gets into the mother's system, stimulatin",9822

Anyways, here you go...\n\n\n Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter\n    Uploaded on Jun 3, 2005  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nEffects of Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter \n\nEach society in the world is unique, and each has its own values and beliefs. Throughout time, societies have shaped the way that man lives. This includes not only his actions, but it also includes his thoughts and feelings. In many instances, such as in Puritan societies, religion plays the most important role. The Crucible by Arthur Miller and The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne are stories which vividly demonstrate the effect society has on people. The Puritan society that is created in each of these stories acts as the driving force to their plots. \nIn The Crucible, the entire plot is molded by the morals of the Puritan society. The superstition that many Puritans believed in is represented through Reverend Parris. He insists to Abigail that “if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Miller 10). Parris was not only concerned about the witches, but was terrified that his reputation will be ruined as well. This example also leads to another aspect of Puritan society that affected the plot. The Puritan people were very closely knit, meaning that everyone knew everyone else, and consequently, rumors spread quickly. This was why Reverend Parris needed to know “Who? Who? Their names, their names!” (Miller 44), so he could find someone to blame for the madness. The fear of witchcraft was so strong that even the decent Reverend John Hale, who was the most open minded of the characters, worried about its effect. He even had books in which there “…is all the invisible world, caught, defined, and calculated…the Devil stands stripped of all his brute disguises…we shall find him out if he has come among us…” (Miller 37). Another attitude of Puritan society that shapes this play is the fear of God. This fear is seen everywhere and it goes hand in hand with the idea of superstition. \nReverend Hale tells Tituba, “You are God’s instrument…face God- face God, Tituba, and God will protect you” (Miller 44), exhibiting the great trust that the people hold in God and how their actions are all in the name of him. This story would not exist without the God-fearing mindset of the Puritan people. John Proctor is no exception to this theme. He has a moral dilemma in which he states, “…I wilted, and, like a Christian, I confessed. Confessed!…Let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not!” (Miller 52). Even though he did not seem like the most religious man in the story, he remains loyal to his strong morals because of the society around him. The Puritan society in The Crucible was what let the story make sense. \nThe Scarlet Letter is another story that relies on the values of the Puritans and their society. The idea of harsh punishment for sins was the broadest of these values. Hester Prynne was punished with public humiliation and “with only that one ornament, -the scarlet letter,- which it was her doom to we",9830

0,"Has anyone had an experience with ghosts. I use to believe in them but I am not sure now.? ; There certainly have been a lot of sightings in the worlds. Any stories anyone? (real ones) ; I believe in ghostly events.  Having witnessed 5 events personally and watched my daughter holding a conversation with my mother after my mother had died.  As I have told of one of my experiences in a Wiltshire pub previously I will not re-tell that one, however I  will share these 2 with you.\n\nSome years ago, whilst working as a Security Supervisor at a Retail Outlet my colleague started out on his patrol.  As he wandered sown the mall he shouted back to me, ""look at the clock"".  The clock he was referring to was an old railway platform clock that had been restored and worked fine.  The hands on the clock were spinning furiously in different directions, they continued to do so for about 10 minutes then they stopped at the correct time and kept time for the remainder of the shift. (The whole thing was recorded on CCTV as we knew no-one would believe us).\n\nAt the same venue, I observed a man wearing a burgundy waistcoat walk into a children's playing area and towards some glass doors linking two of the malls. These doors were locked, the fire exits to the left of the doors were secured by plastic seals  and the only way back out would have been to return the same way as he had entered. Back through the children's playing area and along the concourse. Once again all the CCTV cameras in that area (there was 3) were pointing at this man who would be about 50-55 years old, quite a portly figure wearing a burgundy waistcoat and white shirt (please bear in mind that it was in the early hours of the morning and quite cold).  When my colleague went to investigate the man was no where to be seen. He checked the fire exits and all seals were intact, all the mall doors were locked. The only way that he could have gone was back through the playing area.  After the shift we pulled the CCTV tapes and you could follow this man's steps all the way up to the mall doors, where he goes out of sight behind a brick pillar, then moments later my colleague arrives at the location to find no-one there.\n\n(The outlet is a regenerated Railway building - could it have been an old station master?)\n\nThere will always be some people who do not believe - but I have seen too much to believe there is nothing after this life for us.",9844

2,"Is it possible that a thin person could be diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism? ; OK, so I'm not the most elidgible to have Hyperthyroidism. I'm only a teenager but I think I have it because of the chills. I'm getting a blood test done and as I'm scared that I have it, I'm also a little scared of not having it becacuse my mom doesn't believe me and I had to make a big deal about it so she would get me an apointment. She says the pediatrition will laugh at me and tell me teens don't get Hypothroidism and not even give me the test :( I think that the chills are a bit odd (twitching/jerking/shaking of my right shoulder, or arm/hand, face, and head shaking) but she says everybody gets chills, I just think I get a lot of them. The problem with my theory is that the main idea of Hypothyroidism is that it slows your metablism (as the thyroid's perpose is to release hormones that regulate the metabilism) and I'm not fat. I'm actualy below my recomended weight and the average for my age and height. Does this mean I have no chance of being diagnosed with Hypothoroidism? ; Ok, I'm a little confused by your question, do you think you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyriodism?  You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.  I get the two confused all the time but hyperthyroidism means your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone and hypothyroid means it makes not enough.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, a young thin person can have hypothyroidism.  I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850
1,"Is there dwarfism in turtles? ; Okay here's why I asked this: I've been enjoying catching and releasing turtles since I was a little girl. My friends, family and I started a tradition wear we'd paint their plastrons with unique symbols made from nail polish, so we'd recognize them if we'd catch 'em again. Some markings last longer than others. Besides natural wear, I figured that some lasted longer than others because if the turtle was still growing bigger, it's shell would get bigger and stretch the nail polish making it crack off. This one Blanding's turtle we've been catching for over the past five years and his markings are still there! He's obviously done growing. But there's this one little painted turtle I caught this year that's no bigger than it was last year, and the marking looked as new as it did last year. But the turtle looked pretty little and looked like it should have grown some. Maybe it's a ""midget"" turtle? ; cool question!\n\nno reptiles do not suffer from dwarfism in the true sense that humans do \n\nbut they can have retarded or stunted growth due to stress or poor food etc either when they are in the egg or subsequent to that",9852
1,"g(x)= x(squared) sin (1/x). how do i use the definition of the derivative to show that g is differentiable? ; for the function f(x)= x sin (1/x).  how do show that it is contiuous at x=0.  show that f(0+h)-f(0)/h = sin (1/h).  Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

There are plenty of research opportunities available in your desired field.  Penn State has the largest alumni network in the world.

There is much controversy on this disorder, with many people beleiving it doesn't exist at all.  If you want more information you can check out the DSM.  \n\nFor a quick overveiw of symptoms:\n\nPatients exhibit a remarkable array of symptoms that can resemble other neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, personality disorders, schizophrenic and mood psychoses, and seizure disorders. Symptoms of this particular disorder can sometimes include:\n\ndepression \nanxiety (sweating, rapid pulse, palpitations) \nphobias \npanic attacks \nphysical symptoms (severe headaches or other bodily pain) \nfluctuating levels of function, from highly effective to disabled \ntime distortions, time lapse, and amnesia \nsexual dysfunction \neating disorders \nsleeping disorders (insomnia, sleepwalking, night terrors) \nposttraumatic stress \nsuicidal preoccupations and attempts \nepisodes of self-mutilation \npsychoactive substance abuse[4] \nSigns of DID include:\n\ndiscussion of self in 3rd person \nnever feeling alone \ntalk of looking through others' eyes \ntalk of being half in and half out of their body \nsays ""we"" when talking about themselves \nabused as a child-87% (physically, mentally or verbally) \nOther symptoms include: Depersonalization, which refers to feeling unreal, removed from one's self, and detached from one's physical and mental processes. The patient feels like an observer of his life and may actually see himself as if he were watching a movie. Derealization refers to experiencing familiar persons and surroundings as if they were unfamiliar and strange or unreal.\n\nAgain, doctors must be careful not to assume that a client has MPD or DID simply because they present with some or all of these symptoms. Another factor in the diagnosis is that all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares idea, which is to say that although many of these symptoms may be present in an individual, he or she may not necessarily have DID. For example, someone may have severe PTSD (one symptom) and self mutilate with suicidal ideas, which is 3 of the above symptoms, but will not have DID. In order for DID to be diagnosed, there must be two or more distinctly present personalities.\n\nPersons with dissociative identity disorder are often told of things they have done but do not remember and of notable changes in their behavior. They may discover objects, productions, or handwriting that they cannot account for or recognize; they may refer to themselves in the first person plural (we) or in the third person (he, she, they); and they may have amnesia for events that occurred between their mid-childhood and early adolescence. Amnesia for earlier events is normal and widespread.",9876

3,"Huge cognitive IQ increase in a child that had a delay? Is this possible with  AN IEP? ; My daughter has an IEP, she has some delays .

It's hard to beleive that her cognitive  IQ (18 mothes later) is that of a 5 yr old . I'm wonering if this is possible or if theres an error? ; There are many factors involved here, and you have had some very good answers.  IQ tests tend to not be very accurate with young children for a whole variety of reasons, and it can be expected that tests given later will produce different scores. It also depends for example, on the particular test used.  \n\nDid you daughter have lots of special programming and attention after the first test?  If so, that teaching may have helped her make some significant gains in her skills.  Does she seem to be progressing very well?  If so, her delays may have been developmental, and she may  ""catch up"" quite a bit, given lots of good programming.\n\nWith all of that said, it is really impossible for any of us to give you an absolute answer to your question, because we don't know your daughter, which test was used, etc. but anything is possible.  However, the difference you describe is quite a big one, and as you said, it is hard to believe that there could be that much improvement so quickly.  \n\nPay particular attention to your daughter and her development over the next months.  Stimulate her learning as much as you can.  Ask her teacher what you can do at home to help her progress even more than she has, but don't overwhelm her with too much work and practice.  Most likely she will be tested again  in a year or so, and then you may have a better answer.   \n\nBest of luck to you and your daughter.",9946
