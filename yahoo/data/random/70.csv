1,"Marble Rollocoster? ; I am learning about Nutin's law an object going in a straight line will remain to until it is acted on. I am doing an obsticle corse for it in school, so does anyone know anything that will slow a marble down? ; A marble is a rolling mass.  The theory is that the marble rolls along and the area of the marble in contact with the surface it is rolling on is not slipping.\n\nAs the marble rolls along, the forces that act on it are \n\n1.  Gravity\n\n2.  Air resistance\n\nI recommend that you focus on gravity to create forces of predictable magnitude and direction.  You can use ramps and then apply Newton's laws and a little trig to calculate the force magnitudes and predict the motion of the marble. As long as you have a decent velocity without being too fast, air resistance will be negligible.\n\nI designed a simple track for you that you could make out of light plywood and some glue.\n\nThe track I propose will be a valley that is 2 meters long (a little over 6 feet) and 1/2 meter wide( 20 inches wide will give you some margin).  The valley sides are set at an angle of 30 degrees.  At one end of the valley at the top of the valley side set up a ramp that will inject a marble such that the direction of the velocity of the marble is straight with respect to the edge of the valley.  The height of the ramp will control the velocity of the.\n\nNow, consider a coordinate system that has x starting from the same end as the ramp and running parallel to the sides of the valley.  y is perpindicular to the sides of the valley.\n\nI created a variable, h, that is the vertical height of the starting end of the ramp with respect to the entry point of the marble.\nUsing conservation of energy, the velocity of the marble will be related through the equation:\n1/2*m*v^2=m*g*h\nv=sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nThe time it will take the marble to roll the length of the valley I set as t\nlength of the valley is 2m\nso 2m=v*t\nt=2/sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nWhen the marble enters the top edge of the valley it will have a velocity in the x direction of v as derived above.  This is your constant velocity since the only forces that will act on the marble in the x direction is air resistance, which we will assume to be negligible.\nSince the marble enters the valley near the top edge, it will be acted on by gravity to pull it down the edge.  If you have the marble enter the ramp at exactly .25m from the center, it reach the center of the ramp in time t'\nwhere \n.25=1/2*g*cos(30)*t'^2\nor t'=sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\n\nI thought it would be fun to consider an experiment where you control how many times the marble rolls across the center of the valley before exiting at the other end.\nThis I set as N\nNote that t/t'=N\nN=(2/sqrt(2*g*h))/sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\nN=2*sqrt(g*cos(30))/sqrt(2*g*h*.5)\nN=2*sqrt(cos(30)/h)\n\nThen I thought that it would be fun to set up an equation where we decide how many Ns we want according to how high we set the end of the ramp.  Sound like fun?\n\nN^2=4*cos(30)/h\nh=4*cos(30)/N^2\n(h is in units of meters)\nN   h(m)   h(inches)\n3    .385    15.15\n4    .0771   3.04\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nj",9

5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13

It increased 5 times in 4 years under Bu$h.\n\nWASHINGTON - If it seems like your taxes have been going up, they probably have — at least at the state level. State taxpayer burdens increased by an average of 41 percent from 1994 to 2004, according to newly released data from the census bureau. Only one state, Alaska, saw the amount it collects per person decline. Even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation, the individual tax burdens increase in 43 states.\nHawaiians last year paid the most to state government — $3,050 per person on average. Texans paid the least — an average of $1,368.\nRising education and Medicaid costs have fueled spending growth, which has led to higher taxes, analysts said.\n""Medicaid has been the fastest growing program in state budgets going back to 2000,"" said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst at the National Council of State Legislatures.\nMedicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for the poor.

9,"Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? ; Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? \n\n\nBy Derek Shaw \nThe Daily Trojan\nOctober 4, 2002 \nGeorge Orwell's ""1984"" depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. The threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the ""Party,"" the single political power in the totalitarian state of Oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people.\n\nSound somewhat familiar? Well it should ...\n\nAs the likelihood of war in the Middle East continues to escalate, American citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing Americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. \n\nWithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in ""1984"" to the affairs of today.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nIn ""1984,"" the bold slogan of the Party is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" This set of socio-political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. The assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption.\n\nThe state of Oceania in ""1984"" is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever-shifting enemy. The government leads the public to \n\nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact \n\nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. One day the enemy is Eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is Eastasia and has always been Eastasia. The people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. The real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred.\n\nToday we are facing imminent war with Iraq. A year ago our target was al-Qaida and bin Laden. Then it became a battle within Afghanistan. And just to be sure, President George W. Bush openly labeled Iran, North Korea and Iraq as the ""axis of evil."" In a later speech, he added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIndeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. On Aug. 22, 2002, Bush called Saddam Hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. Granted, Hussein is not the first person on most of our Christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? Surely it is a mere coincidence that Bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting Iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world.\n\nIn many ways, Bush has become the physical manifestation of Big Brother, the omnipotent, all-knowing symbol of leadership in Oceania. In ""1984,"" Big Brother is both feared and loved by the people. His power goes untested. Similarly, the Bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the American people have responded with a show of faith and support. In fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show American pride with stickers, T-shirts and flags. A frenzy of nationalism has infected our country; and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the United States.\n\nAs a result, American freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. In ""1984,"" signs re ; With massive data bases of information piling up in government and corporate computers as well as security cameras around every corner and on every cell phone, I often get the feeling Big Brother is watching.  However, I feel Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is better example of the direction we have been moving as a society.  Everywhere people are seeking their own ""Soma"" to cover up our social flaws.  We are also pushing closer and closer to his predictions of class and family structures .",40

Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

For example, WWW (win, win, win) is the only way for the 3 games straight, but the 3 games out of 4 can be LWWW (lose, win, win, win) or WLWW or WWLW.  The 3 games out of 5 can be WWLLW, WLWLW, LLWWW, WLLWW, LWLWW, or LWWLW.\n\nYou get the idea, I'm sure.",359

2,"I was recently diagnosed with TMD (temporomandibular jaw disorder). Are there 'normal' med treatments to TMD? ; My specialist up until now has fitted me with a lower jaw appliance. Since then, however, he's told me to take a load of vitamins every day, and at the last visit gave me a 'relaxation and meditation' CD that, among other things, asks me to visualize waterfalls and clouds (?!?). The more things progress, the more we seem to veer away from 'medicine' and towards alternative healthcare mumbo jumbo. I'm feeling a bit deceived, but this dentist is insisting this will help. All the while, I keep writing very, very large cheques. Am I being unreasonable? Are there real treatments I'm missing out on? What should I ask or, or insist on, at my next visit? Many thanks!! ; Sounds liek your doctor is a quack. A relaxation CD? Well TMD is a complex disease that people don't really understand all that well but there are steps to treatment. First step is that if you grind or clench at night or in the daytime is to correct that problem. Stressing a bad joint is only going to make the problem worse. So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain. Stop ibuprofen though if it tears up your stomach. There are treatments .... and there are steps.  This guy giving you a CD and charging you money for that crap is not medicine",364

I've read up on ExpressCards and CardBus interface, but no go, they're apparently used for devices such as modems, hard drives, gigE etc. The IBM ThinkPad has a PCI express graphics bus interface. Would i have to physically open the laptop to install the card, just like installing one on a desktop? How will i determine which card will be compatible for my laptop? ; While the laptop has a PCI express interface, it does *not* have a PCI express card slot -- the interface is on the motherboard directly between the graphics chip and the bus, there is no slot.  It follows the electrical and data rate specs of PCI Express, but not the desktop-PC *form factor* for the PCI Express card slot.\nSo, basically, you can't put a new graphics card in the laptop.  It's soldered on the motherboard.  No replacement is possible without buying a whole new motherboard.\nSorry.",384

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

6,"What's the cheapest way to incorporate a business? and where is the best place? ; So far I've encoutered some very high prices to have someone incorporate you. And is it true, Incorporating in Nevada the easiest. ; The cheapest way to incorporate is to do it yourself. You can get all the forms you need from your state ""Department of Corporations"" Go to your state and put in a request to reserve a name, that normally cost about $10.00-$15.00. They will normally require at least 2-4 names so if the main one is used they have a couple of more to research.\n\nThere are a few sites that will incorporate you for less than $300.00, but you would need a Corporate Seal that you can pick up at staples. Some of the sites sell them for as low as $45.00\nYou will have to check out the add ons that you would want them to do in the forming of your corporation.\n \nIf you do not live in Nevada and you incorporate in Nevada, you may do business in Nevada. If you don't live in Nevada and you decide to do business in the state in which you live your Nevada corporation would be considered an alien Corporation in your state. You would have to pay an additional fee for your state to allow your alien Corporation to do business in your state. This fee is any where from $200.00-$600.00.\n\nThe reason people set up a corporation in Nevada is because Nevada does not give out information about the corporation officers, money earned and stuff to the IRS. If you set up business in your state with your Nevada corporation I think you lose that shield in the other state, because the corporate with the IRS.  \n\nTry this link and see if they can offer you a good deal on doing your corporation.\n\nhttp://www.clickandinc.com\n\nI hope this has been of some use to you, good luck. \n\n""FIGHT ON""",525
3,"What is the quickest way to get a degree in Nursing? ; I am interested in becoming an R.N. and I have heard it is possible to do in as little as 2 years. I would be starting from scratch (just high school diploma) Is 2 years possible? ; There are 3 ways in becoming a nurse (RN).  Diploma program, associate's degree, and bachelor's degree.  You can also become an LPN.  The diploma program and associate degree program take 2 years to complete.  However, most AD (associate's degree) programs require sciences to be completed or will put you on a wait list.  The AD program is usually offered by a community college or local college.  The diploma program is easier to get into (no wait list, no sciences prior to admission) and is offered by a hospital or adult community classes.  The LPN is usually offered through adult classes and will only take 1 year.  The advantage of becoming an LPN is that you will become a nurse in one year and can transfer to a college to then become an RN for only an additional year.  (You can work as an LPN as you study to become an RN).  So, yes it is possible for you to become an RN in 2 years.  If you are a senior now, look at all of the programs near you NOW.  You need to apply because the spots to fill up quickly.  I hope this was helpful in your quest to becoming an RN.  If you can, brush up on your sciences.",526

6,"h1b visa - as a company how to host? ; I have a small business and have been trying to fill software positions with qualified resources at ""the prevailing wage"". I have some foreign talent candidates that are interested. Is there a service to do this on your behalf or a recommended book to read.? ; Since you are new to this, you should consider retaining an immigration attorney.  The procedure is not rocket science, but requires some interaction with you state's Department of Labor (not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Labor) before you actually file the paperwork with the immigration.  \n\nLegal fees will probably run you about $2,000 per case (I've seen as low is $1,500 and as high as $5,000 with level of service completely uncorrelated to the price; a cheap lawyer can be as good or as bad as an expensive one); you will also have to pay a non-refundable filing fee of $1,500 per case to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  There may be other expenses, such as the cost of evaluating your prospective employee's education credentials (the law requires that H-1B workers hold at least a Bachelor's degree in the area of their proposed employment or a related area), but they are typically small compared to attorney fees and filing fees.  \n\nYou will be requried to post a notice to your employees about the fact that you are hiring H-1B workers and sign an affidavit stating that you in fact posted such notice.  \n\nYou should also remember that the best time to file for an H-1B is right after the beginning of the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1), so you should file in October or November.  Usually, USCIS stops accepting H-1B petitions in January or February, because the annual quota for H-1B visas gets filled.  If your attorney neglects to mention this at the initial interview (as some sleazy ones do), don't hire him; he is trying to charge you for putting together a petition that he knows full well will be rejected.\n\nIf you are in California, I can recommend a good attorney (knowledgeable, approachable, and reasonably priced) whom I have repeatedly used over the last few years.",536

4,"If somone knows your IP address, can they access your computer and know everything? ; I am curious to know, if soemone can hack into your computer and see what you were doing either online or not online? Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?

While we're talking, he noticed an old lady having trouble starting up her junky car.  He went to help her.  \n\nThere was a jogger who saw the problem they were having and he and my date got on the rear of the lady's car and started pushing so that the lady can get a running start at the wheel.  They were pushing for about 50 yards when suddenly, the engine comes to life and vrooom!  The old lady drives away without even thanking them.  They're flabbergasted, surrounded by a cloud of exhaust gas.  What made it hilarious was that the jogger dude wound up spraining his ankle while he was pushing the car.  We had to drive this total stranger to his house because he couldn't walk.\n\nThat wasn't really cool but it made the date a memorable one.  Also, it gave me an idea that my date was a very kind and helpful fellow.",631
4,"why doesnt anyone care about vista? ; could someone please shed some light on this please? ; I believe this is partly due to the fact that the requirements to run Vista are much, much higher than ever before. To actually run Vista necessitates high specs, and even needs a decent graphics card to run and a minimum of 1 gigabyte to manage, which effectively renders most older machines useless.\n\nEDIT: That's a good point you bring up. However, there definitely is an emphasis on ""power"" with Vista; Microsoft is focusing on how Vista looks and functions and how elaborate the graphic interface is, instead of explaining to customers the actual performance of the OS and its design.",632

Having been accepted at a very big-name university for grad school, I can tell you that the place you do your undergrad is not as crucial as you may believe.  You do not need to go to an Ivy to have a great career or to get into an excellent grad school.  So my advice is to relax a little.  The ""top"" colleges are so competitive that there is no way to guarantee admission, no matter how amazing your application looks.\n\nI would guess that either IB or AP will give you an edge.\n\nSleep is very important.

1,"if the space shuttle had a nuclear reactor on board, then it slows down and re-enter earth's atmosphere no hea ; is the heat problem upon re-entry of the shuttle because we do not have the power to match the earth's rotation exactly then re-enter? ; Yes the heat is because the shuttle is going about 17,000 mph or more.  But think about it... if we caused it to slow down to the earth's rotational speed, it would drop like a stone!  The shuttle is very non-aerodynamic, it's like flying a brick with small wings.  Without the speed, it would be impossible to maneuver it to base because after entering the atmosphere it's like a big clumsy glider.\n\nIf we were to glide in gently under power like a jet, it would have to be much more aerodynamic. So it's possible, and the people working on the X prize are doing just that.  \n\nBut you will not find nuclear energy on a spaceship any time soon.

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

Instead, people vote for individual representatives in parliament for their district (like how we vote for Representatives), and the party that receives a majority of seats (or coalition of parties if none has a majority) votes for who among them should be prime minister.\n\nIn countries that have both, the President has very little power and is mainly a ceremonial position, much like the Queen in England.",876

1,"whats -16x squared + 80x + 3? ; i think u have to solve it by binomiels but i cant think of 2 numbers that multiple to 16 and add to 80. its a parabala and i have to graph it please help ; y = -16x^2 +80x +3\n\nFirst of all, it is a negative quadratic function, so, you expect this quadratic function to open downwards. Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943

6,"i need advice on how to make money on real estate buy remodel and sell? ; i have 10 + years carpentery exp drywall painting hardwood floor install sand finish ; Remember you only make money when you BUY a property, not when you sell it.  That means that you have to ""make"" your money when you buy the house.  Make sure you have enough equity in the house upfront to:\n\n1.  Repair the house for sale.  This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950

I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963

In the months following 9/11 President Bush could have asked us to do almost anything, I think.

In a healthy individual, calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship, that means that when one goes up, the other goes down.  Serum calcium tends to decrease i people who have osteoporosis or inadequate intake of calcium.  Calcium needs Vitamin D to aid in absorption.  Eat foods high in calcium, or take supplements with both Vit D and Calcium. Calcium supplements should be taken 1-2 hrs after a meal to increase intestinal absorption.\nIs your low calcium-high phosphorus levels caused by an underlying condition, such as renal failure, Crohn's disease, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease?  Is it caused by improper functioning of the thyroid and parathyroid glands? If so, the underlying condition must be treated in order for the mineral balance to be restored, thus allowing more calcium to be absorbed.\nSee your Doctor, to treat the underlying problem, then add calcium and Vit D to your diet.",1122

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.

1,"Soil Conservation? ; CausesConsequencesSolutions\nSoil Erosion•••\nDesertification\n\nSalinization•••\n•••\n\nDescribing ways in which your lifestyle directly or indirectly contributes to Soil degradation. ; Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms (in the case of bioerosion). Although the processes may be simultaneous, erosion is to be distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock. Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n\nA certain amount of erosion is natural and in fact healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continually move downstream in watercourses. Too much erosion, however, can cause problems, clogging streams with gravel, filling reservoirs with sediment, reducing soil fertility and water\n \ncauses : What causes erosion to be severe in some areas and minor elsewhere? It is a combination of many factors, including the amount and intensity of precipitation, the texture of the soil, the gradient of the slope, ground cover (from vegetation, rocks, etc.) and land use. The first factor, rain, is the agent for erosion, but the degree of erosion is governed by other factors.\n\nThe first three factors can remain fairly constant over time. In general, given the same kind of vegetative cover, you expect areas with high-intensity precipitation, sandy or silty soils, and steep slopes to be the most erosive. Soils with a lot of clay that receive less intense precipitation and are on gentle slopes tend to erode less.\n\nThe factor that is most subject to change is the amount and type of ground cover. When fires burn an area or when vegetation is removed as part of timber operations, building a house or a road, the susceptibility of the soil to erosion is greatly increased.\n\ncontrol : Examples of some erosion control methods include:\n\nconservation tillage \ncontour plowing \ncover crops \ngabions \nhydroseeding \nreforestation \nriparian strips \nriprap \nstrip farming \nvegetated waterways \nterracing \nwattle (construction) \nwindbreaks",1267

I got the 30 year loan 8 years ago. Should I pay it off early? ; That all depends on your financial situation, long-term goals, interest rate, etc...\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\n1) Your house is a LIABILITY - unless it puts money IN your pocket, it's a liability.  It's an asset on the BANK's balance sheet.  Tax write offs...sure, but look at how much interest you'll pay over the course of the loan.  Figure that you'll basically pay double for the loan.  If you can pay it off in 20 years vs 30, you'll save thousands in interest.  If you invested that into a mutual fund, real estate (rental property or buy/flip), you'd stand to make a lot more than a write off.\n\n2)  What's your overall debt situation?  Do you have lots of credit cards, loans, dept store cards, etc...?  If you can make the mortgage payments, and you have a lot of cc debt, it may make more sense to pay off the higher interest rate debt first.  \n\nConsult with a financial expert / tax expert etc... for specific advice.\n\nI would also point you to ""Smart Women / Couples Finish Rich"", by David Bach.

He refused untold requests to publish them during his lifetime. \nMadison was the last surviving signer of the Constitution. \nDuring his terms in office, Congress passed resolutions calling on Madison to issue religiously-tinged proclamations of thanksgiving, to which he assented. During his retirement, Madison composed his ""Detached Memorandum,"" in which he assailed such proclamations as violations of church-state separation. \nIn 2006, historians ranked Madison's failure to avoid war as the #6 worst Presidential mistake. \nMadison was the first U.S. President who had not previously held the office of Vice President. (Washington does not qualify since there was no office of V.P. prior to his Presidency). \nBoth of Madison's Vice Presidents, George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry, died in office. \nMadison's portrait was on the U.S. $5000 bill. There were about twenty different varieties of $5000 bills issued between 1861 and 1946; all but three featured James Madison.

(eg. public service ads).\n\n\nPlease also see similar question on use of silence... ; Music is a vitally important ingredient in TV advertising. To see how cleverly it is used, record a few on video and play them over a few times. My best example is Pampers where a mother asks a baby to get up from the floor and walk over to her and father says the baby cannot move because of the nappy. The music is baby-like during this phase. The ad then cuts to the benefits of Pampers and then back to the baby who does get up and walk across the room. Almost imperceptibly, the music changes to a kind of triumphal sound. On one watching, you would be unaware of it. Only by playing the ad over can you hear the mood that is created. In answer to your other questions, try replaying and noting how many different camera set ups there were in a 15 or 30 second ad, then analyse the story being told, then listen to see how sound, including music, adds atmosphere.",1459
7,"Why does in naruto, every character wears white stripes on their right leg? ; Why? ; I have been wondering that too!!!\nWHY????\nI really want to know! Does anyone know why?\n\nAt first I thought it was just a weird anime character design, but I don’t think that is it.  It has to have more meaning…  Then I thought maybe it helps them fight?  Maybe they use that leg more, so the bandages might help constrain the leg from twisting it funny or stretching their muscles while fighting, so they will be less likely to get injured!  Don't know, just a thought...\n:-P\n\nAdded:\nHey, I think I know why!  Look at this picture:\nhttp://www.asylum-anime.com/pboards/naruto-0204C.jpg\nSee where the bandages are at?  He has a strap fastened around his leg, over the bandages, with a bag that holds more weapons.  So, the bandages are there to help hold the weapons in place!  I don’t know how to describe it…  \n\nBut it holds his clothes closer to him, so that it will not get in the way when he reaches for the weapons.  It also has a greater chance that the weapons will not move because the clothes will not move and possibility loosen the straps.  Also, it will help so that their legs, where they have the bag of weapons fasten to, won’t get irritated from constantly rubbing against their skin.  It gives extra padding!!!  And not all of the ninjas have the bandages on that leg!  One of the sounds group (I think it was the sounds, it was in the episode where they are in the death forest) had the bandages on the other leg.  Sasuke makes a point about this when one of them pretends they are Naruto, but has the bandages on the wrong leg!  It's because the sound guy is left handed!  Everything makes sense now!!!\n\nYea!  I'm so happy now!\n\nSorry, I know that I’m writing in circles…  I’m very bad at describing things…",1460

What could it be? ; I have the same problem with my hands- especially in colder weather. Do you only keep lotion on them when they're cracked? If so, then that's probably where the problem is. You need to keep lotion on them all the time. Also, make sure that when you wash your hands, you dry them completely and NEVER go outside in cold weather with wet hands!

She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

Look at Jimmy Page... he plays everything from $80 Sears Silvertones to $200 Danelectros to $500 Fenders to $6000 Gibsons.\n\nThe problem is that you don't really know what a guitar will sound like on stage until you are there, and that is called experience.

If then happens then Delano will have an amount of money that is the equivalent of four dimes less that he had:\n\n10(n-4)\n\nAnd Nadine will have an amount of money equal to four dimes more than she had:\n\n5(n + 7) + 40\n\n40 being the amount of cents equal to 4 dimes\n\nSo therefore, we can create the equality:\n\n5(n + 7) + 40 = 10(n -4) or by distributive multiplication\n\n5n + 35 + 40 = 10n - 40 or by performing initial arithmetic operations\n\n5n + 75 = 10n - 40 or by adding 40 to each side\n\n5n + 115 = 10n or by subtracting 5n from each side\n\n115 = 5n therefore, if we divide each side by 5\n\n23 = n\n\nTo check this, Delano's 23 dimes would give him $2.30. Nadine would have 7 more nickels that Delano has dimes and so she would have a total of 30 nickels for a total of $1.50. If Delano gives her 4 dimes or $.40, her total will rise to $1.90 while his will fall from $2.30 to $1.90. The value checks.",1712

I am graduating from a university in 2008 with a degree in criminal justice. I am looking at one agency in particular, Diplomatic Security. Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

It is an oil war! The west wanted to control the middle east to control the OIL , manipulate the prices (the price of a barrel has tripled since the war with no clear reason) so it becomes difficult for China to get the energy they need to compete with US. \nThe British media and American media are nothing but a few millionaires who run the show.

That doesn't really make much sense, seeing how all creatures are in the process of turning into ""something else"" - we just don't know what the future of evolution holds.  Haven't you heard about the recent discovery of the fossil of the ""fish"" which helps to provide evidence of the transition of animals from water to land?  I don't really know what you mean by saying that there are no ""missing links"" - there are thousands of them!  I just ahve the feeling that no number of missing links would be sufficient.  Between any two species it will always be possible ask for a ""linking"" fossil, and since there cannot be an infinite number of fossils, it will always be theoretically possible to say that no missing links have been found.\n\nmamcrackin: http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12200044CLXE\nsee my comment above that no number of misssing links will ever be able to ""prove"" evolution.

This is not what we find when looking at the fossils in the layers of earth.  The great flood was also gods way of killing a lot of animals who had done nothing to deserve that punishment. by the way, hovind's PhD (from a non accredited school) is in christian education, not biology or any other science. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind  \nI really have to wonder where you are getting your facts from.

I have read that the American Native people who smoke only dried tobacco leaves have a very low incidence of lung cancer.\nOf course today we also have all the wonderful polution in the air from chemical plants and car exhaust plus the pollution of the water by chemical plants who produce chemical fertilizers for golf courses and farms and people's lawns.

Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

3,"how do i find pictures of the murdered alexi romanov? ; he was the son of the Czar Romanov and murdered? with his entire family in russia ; There are no photographs existing of the child.\nOn July 16, 1918  the royal family was awakened in the middle of the night, taken to a basement room, and shot. Their bodies were eventually buried in a muddy roadway, beneath railroad ties, where they remained until 1979.\n\nThat was when a retired geologist, Alexander Avdonin, and a Russian filmmaker, Geli Ryabov, deduced where the burial site was located. But it was not until 1991 that the bones were exhumed. It took another three years to positively identify the remains through DNA analysis, and something shocking was learned. Only nine skeletons were in the grave. There should have been eleven. Two of Nicholas II's children were not there. Russian experts who examined the bones concluded, from photographic superimposition, that daughter, Maria, and son, Alexei, were missing. An American expert analyzed dental and bone specimens and independently determined the missing to be son, Alexei, and daughter, Anastasia. The debate over who was right raged for years and has, to this day, never been resolved. The only point that all agree upon is that the remains of two imperial children have never been found.",2190

If you have a rally which requires a lot of short sharp movement, it may take your body a moment or two before it realises that a lot of oxygen is needed for recovery. \nThis can result in a sudden increase in heart rate. \nThis is not a good thing for those who lack fitness\n\nCheck the link for much more info!\nGood luck!",2383

SAT scores are not the only thing that colleges look at, and plus, your SAT score doesn't judge the content of your character. It's more important to be a god person than to be a high test scorer.

Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

Lots of really good woods out there and most everyone has their fav....me I just say cut a sapling.\n\nUse a semisharp knife and a hammer and split it right down the middle from the thin end.

Starting about a foot on either side of the center point, start whittling the triangle flatter and flatter as you move out to the ends.  Always whittle the back, not the front!\n\nKeep experimenting with bending it as you whittle....so if one end bends more than the other, simply whittle a bit more on the other end til it bends approx the same.  That's called ""tillering"".  I won't get into it.\n\nOnce both ends (the limbs) bend in a good solid arc and it feels good to you, carefully notch the ends so they can hold a string.\n\nTie your string on one end and then keep bending the bow and retying the other til the tight string is approx 8"" from the back of the bow.\n\nThat's a really basic survival type bow.  You could spend years mastering each step if you wanted to really make bows, but that one will have you shooting within an hour or two and they're fun to teach the kids as a summer project.\n\nArrows....you can use the same old 1/4 trunks that you cut for the bow.

1,"My Science Fair Project? ; Hello,\n\nMy name is Micki and I am a sixth grade student in California studying and \ngathering research for an upcoming Science Fair Project at my school. \n\nWhat do you think the outcome of this experiment will be?\n\nWhat effect does temperature have on how fast salt dissolves in water?\n\nMy Hypothesis is:I think the lower the temperature the slower the salt will \ndissolve because the molecules of the salt will form together and tighten so \nit will make one big salt rock. \n\nWhat are your comments on this?\n\nThank you for your time and help on my project, I appreciate it. ; i'd say you have a basic understanding of molecular chemistry, micki.\n\nhowever, to improve your hypothesis, have it say:  I think the lower temperature the slower the salt will dissolve.  This is because the ions in a salt crystal require energy to dissolve away from the rigid crystal form the are in.  there is less energy present in cold water, therefore, the cold water will take longer to dissolve the salt crystals.",2511

9,"What do you think about illegal immigrants? ; Should they be allowed and tolerated, or should we start cracking the whip? ; You know there are probably a lot of terrorists arleady here.  What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice. I say WAKE UP, take responsibility for your actions, and GET LEGAL or leave.",2551

I might get one of them. ; Dental implants vary tremendously in cost depending upon how many you will need.  Some of the answers here are wrong - very wrong.  A dental implant is better for your jaw bone and your own dental health because once the implant is properly seated in the bone it will stimulate your bone to grow just as your normal teeth stimulate the bone to grow.  \n\nI would guess you have seen little old men and or ladies who have almost now lower jaw and no teeth.  The jaw actual stopped growing new bone tissue because of the lack of stimulation for having teeth anchored to the jaw bone. \n\nHere is how they should work. You should have  a CAT scan done of your upper and lower jaw.  Depending upon where the implant is to be placed.  The dentist may want to make a surgical guide that will allow him to drill at the exact angle that is needed to the base of the implant is screwed into the correct type of bone.  This is critical because there are different  types of bone density in your jaw and you want your implant seated in the bone with the greatest density.  Once the implant is placed in your jaw bone he may or may not depending upon the opinion of the dentist  attache the final prosthetic onto the implant.  The prosthetic is what looks like a normal tooth.  Bingo - you are done. \n\nSummary Cost is variable, they do not hurt when inserted.  Dental implants are the best way to go for long lasting dental health",2604

The only thing we should be worrying about is that Ben gets better so he can go on living a long happy life.\nGO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!! ; Most of the people who are calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet have been calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet for a year now. Ever since it became well known that he does it without wearing a helmet people have been saying he was an idiot for it. They aren't calling him an idiot as a general thing, it is calling him an idiot for making a stupid decision. Yes he is 100% within the law. That doesn't mean people don't think the law is stupid. Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head. Remember depending on the helmet they don't really go down enough to prevent a jaw from being broken.\n\nTo old school Yinz is Pittsburghese although most use yunz.\nAs to the one who commented about it being against his contract, sorry but you are mistaken.

6,"2 dollars bills? ; how come the u.s. is not making any more 2 dollars note??? ; In spite of its relatively low value, the two-dollar bill is one of the most rarely seen denominations of U.S. currency. This is partly due to the low production of the note; approximately 1% of all notes produced today are $2 bills. Two-dollar bills, unlike other denominations, are not frequently reissued in a new series. This is because bills are printed according to demand. When the Federal Reserve Banking System runs low on its current supply of $2 bills, it will submit an order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which will then print more. Demand for $2 bills is low enough that one printing can last for many years. There is still a large supply of series 1976 bills that have not been circulated.\n\nIt is still a common perception that the $2 bill is rare, and when the general public encounters them, the bills are frequently hoarded and not circulated. According to the Treasury, they ""receive many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation."" [1]. In response, the Treasury states: ""The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations. According to BEP statistics, 590,720,000 Series 1976 $2 bills were printed and as of February 28, 1999, there was $1,166,091,458 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.""",2693

I was out on a pontoon boat on a local lake that I had fished for ages.  Loads of people go out there for a fireworks show at night, but being the avid fisherman I am, I took along a few rods and a couple tackle boxes.  \n\nWhile we were out there, a few of the people I was with started asking me questions about that particular lake.  One other kid who I knew didn't fish at all and didn't know diddly squat about fishing started answering everything.  He's your stereotypical frat boy and no offense to anyone out there, but he was fishing w/ a zebco 33.  Well after a while, I realized that he answered every question w/ ""Well the only real lure on this lake is a spinnerbait.  It's the only one that works anyways.""\n\nSo I waited until he said it a few more times, and then I said loud enough for everyone to hear me, ""You fish with that spinnerbait, and I'll use a plastic worm and we'll see what happens.""\n\nThis is where it gets good...\n\nFirst cast, I flipped a black trick worm about 3 feet behind an underwater tree that had reached the surface.  I pulled it a few times kinda jerkin' it, and in the next second, BAM!  I hooked up to a 4 pounder.  In about the next hour, I had landed about 25 pounds worth of bass in 5 fish.  \n\nI've fished plenty of tournaments, and I would have killed to have been in one that day, but as they say, ______ happens.\n\nMeanwhile, spinnerbait boy is over there in the corner w/ no bites at all.  By this time the people have tuned him out when he starts talking, and I'm loving it.  Then he casts and says he had a bite.  ""I missed it, I'll get him again.""\n\nThree or four more times, the bite is in the same place, and he keeps missing it.  (I'm starting to think it's a log, weeds, rock, etc. but I didn't say anything)  On the next cast, he got to the spot where he had been getting a ""bite"" and set the hook violently.  He fought and fought and fought and said he had a big one.  ""Get the camera, this one is going to be a good one""  <== Exact words.  \n\nWell when the monster surfaced, it was about a 4 ft. stick.  Everyone kept giving him crap about it and eventually he just sat back and shut up.  From that point on, every question from anyone on the boat was directed towards me!",2719

You can do this by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the drawing like an excel worksheet.\nThe two mviews piece refer to creating viewports in the layout tab so you can see the model your have drawn...to do this make sure you are in the layout tab and click on View - Viewports - 2 viewports, two windows will now appear in the drawing with the same view of the table. \nAssuming the table was drawn correctly double click the area within the first view port and the click on View - 3d Views - Top, this will give you the plan view of the table, adjust the scale to suit. Then double click within the second viewport and the go to View - 3d Views - Isometric (there are 4 to chose from) this will give you your isometric view. Again adjust the scale to suit.

0,"Is Bernard Lonergan more influened by his Louvain heritage than by Aquinas historically understood? ; That is to say, the Louvain tradition was commissioned by Leo XIII to answer the challenges of skepticism a la Kant. Lonergan's magnum opus ""Insight"" turns out in the end to be an argument for the existence of God. In light of Victor Preller's work on Aquinas (which argues that Aquinas's Five Proofs were not meant to prove God's existence but to show the insufficiency of such proofs), should Lonergan be understood to be proving the existence of God as a response to Cartesian and Kantian epistemologies and not (goes the implication) by faithful extension of Aquinas historically understood? ; I've only been through ""Insight"" once, and read the ""Verbum"" articles years ago, so somebody might have a more detailed answer. \n\nLonergan does seem to have a Kantian agenda, though he doesn't directly engage Kant. The Kantian question is: by what right do we make metaphysical statements, such as ""God exists."" Lonergan argues by describing the process by which we makes true statements, though not in the same manner as Kant. His approach is more empirically oriented, looking at everyday experiencing and judging (whereas Kant was interested in the validity of those judgments necessary for Newtonian physics). From this basis, he argues that metaphysical judgments are possible; thus we can give an argument that God exists. \n\nIs this a faithful extension of Aquinas? Leaving aside whether or not Aquinas was interested in proving the existence of God in the modern sense, I would say yes. In fact, much of ""Insight"" sounds to me like a standard neo-scholastic epistemology manual. It's questionable whether his ""turn to the subject"" is a move Aquinas would have made, but I don't see that there's a contradiction between being a response to modern concerns and being a faithful extension of Aquinas.",2734

The original ""gridirons"" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a ""gridiron,"" and so the metaphor was born.

6,"someone help me? ; my teacher asked me that: how to put a elephant into a refrigerator, and after that how to put a lion into that same refrigerator\nIf someone know how, please help me\nThanks ; I smelled a rat when I heard this. Sounded like the teacher had a joke in mind, so here is the answer. It is very long. I have included a source so it is properly academic. \n------------------------------\nHow To Put An Elephant Into A Refrigerator\nAnalysis:\n1) Differentiate it and put into the refrig. Then integrate it in the refrig.\n2) Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).\n3) Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.\n\nNumber theory:\n1) First factorize, second multiply.\n2) Use induction. You can always squeeze a bit more in.\n\nAlgebra:\n1) Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig. Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.\n2) Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.\n\nTopology:\n1) Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.\n2) Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.\n3) The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.\n4) The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.\n5) The property of being inside the referigerator is hereditary. So, take the elephant's mother, cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.\n6) For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals. Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.\n\nAlgebraic topology:\nReplace the interior of the refrigerator by its universal cover, R^3.\n\nLinear algebra:\n1) Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.\n2) Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator. By linearity, x% will fit for any x.\n\nAffine geometry:\nThere is an affine transformation putting the elephant into the refrigerator.\n\nSet theory:\n1) It's very easy! refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the refrigerator both have cardinality c.\n\nGeometry:\nDeclare the following:\nAxiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.\n\nComplex analysis:\nPut the refrig. at the origin and the elephant outside the unit circle. Then get the image under the inversion.\n\nNumerical analysis:\n1) Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term.\n2) Work it out using the Pentium.\n\nStatistics:\n1) bright statistician. Put its tail as a sample and say ""Done.""\n2) dull statistician. Repeat the experiment pushing the elephant to the refrig.\n3) Our NEW study shows that you CAN'T put the elephant in the refrigerator.\n\nTo place a lion into the same refrigerator. Open the refrigerator door take out the elephant and put the lion in.",2806

8,"How do you forgive treachery and COMPLETE selfishness? ; I have 2 demons I'd like to forgive, but I don't know how. \nOne is my ex-bff whom I thought we would actually be bff, but she suddenly stopped talking to me and didn't give me a clue as to why. There was nothing I wouldn't do for her (within reason), and she did stuff for me, just not as much. She invited me to hang out with her and do stuff all the time, and she was a good best friend. I found out that she had been poisoning others against me behind my back, she was never fond of me to begin with, was annoyed when I called her my best friend, and she was using me. I'd like to forgive her, but I don't know how to forgive treachery.\n\nThe other demon is my dad's g/f. She is THE MOST SELFISH person I have EVER met! She expects things to be done all for her or her way, and never lets my dad or ANYBODY else have their say. She doesn't do anything for herself, her daddy does everything for her and lives across the street from her, she's VERY wasteful, and... ; I don't know if you're a religious person, but since your question is about forgiveness, I'll answer it from a Christian perspective; but please understand that you don't have to be religious in order to benefit from the wisdom of the Bible.  I do not consider myself to be Christian, but I still use many things I read in the Bible to help me through challenges of the spirit such as the one you have describe.\n\nFirst of all, we should ALWAYS forgive others.  Jesus said to forgive people seventy times seven times, which comes out to be 490 times.  If you have to forgive someone more times than that, they are probably so evil that it's not going to matter whether you forgive them or not; at that point your best best would bwe to just get the hell away from them!  LOL\n\nBut I think what he meant was to forgive as much as you possibly can.  But you sound very young to me- it sounds like there's not a whole lot you can do OTHER than forgive; sadly, we are basically powerless in our youth to change the behavior of others, so you'd better forgive wholeheartedly and do it RIGHT.  The following information is lengthy, but it will help you learn all you need to know about forgiveneness:\n\n- This is not an optional action on our part, but rather it is imperative to our own well being that we forgive others.\n- Most Christians understand that this is not always an easy task.\n- For some, there have been people in their lives which have wronged them severly.\n\n- Though it may be a process, and it may not happen instantaneously, we must be willing to take the first steps toward forgiving others.\n- As long as we continue to harbor bitterness in our hearts toward someone else, we allow that individual to have a controlling factor in our lives.\n- There are a number of occasions where unforgiving Christians lose their relationship with God because of what someone else had done to them in the church.\n\n- There was once a man who lost his relationship not only with God, but also his children and people in the church because of his bitterness toward others. He basically went around feeling sorry for himself all the time.\n- To forgive means to ""send away"". In other words, to not hang on to the wrong doing.\n\n- When you forgive someone, it means that you are not holding that sin against that person.\n- Therefore, you're not focused on how you can get back at that person.\n- You're not praying that their boat will sink or that their plane will crash.\n- As a matter of fact, you actually begin to pray for their salvation and deliverance.\n\n- Understand that when you forgive someone, it doesn't mean that you have to re-establish a relationship with that person.\n- It may, by God's will, lead to that and that's great if that's what God desires.\n- In the verse, there's no mention that you should stop praying and go find that person to let them know that you forgive them.\n- Release the thought of anger and bitterness and hurt unto God.\n\n- Forgiveness does not mean, by the way, to forget.\n- Trying to forget is merely an attempt to hide something.\n- When you hide something, someone will eventually find it.\n- We're are to deal with he hurt and send it away.\n\n- Jesus didn't just preach this. He lived this.\n\n(Luke 23:33-34 NKJV) And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots.\n\nFORGIVING OTHERS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND AND RECEIVE FORGIVENESS\n\n(Mat 6:14-15 NKJV) ""For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.""\n\n- It seems as if God's ability to forgive us is contingent upon our ability to forgi",2837

It's urgent!I? ; I need specifics and please back up why or how it is the lesson/ moral... or give a good argument for the purpose!! ; The ram with golden fleece was a gift from Mercury to Nephele, to get her children away from their step-mother.  (Ancient child custody issues.)  The girl drowned, but the boy was ""hospitably received"" by Aetes, King of Colchis.  The boy then sacrificed the ram to Jupiter and gave the golden fleece to his host.  He placed it in a consecrated grove with a dragon to guard it.  Eventually, Jason's uncle, who was supposed to surrender the throne of his kingdom when he reached maturity, sent him on a wild goose chase, er golden fleece quest, claiming the fleece was the rightful property of their kingdom.  Which it was not.  Anyway, Jason rounded up a tough bunch of friends of his, and off they went looking for the fleece.\n\nFrom this point on, you can substitute what you know of grail quests, for the symbols and traditions have been intermingled for centuries.  One of the challenges Jason faces is a wily king with a beautiful sorceress for a daughter, named Medea.  Naturally, she becomes instrumental in his success.  Brave hero and beautiful witch.  Haven't we heard that one before a time or two?\n\nFrom here, I'll let you work out the secondary meanings.

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.  Have faith that what you really need will be available to you when the need actually arrives.  Never lose hope...it is stronger than experience.  Live life!!!",2871

Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.  All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery, after all, since some immigrated to America after slavery, or since some have no slave ancestors.  It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry, and then to divide some sum proportionately.\n\nAdditionally, the vague ""400 yr+ of oppression"" is unhelpful in crafting legislation.  Slavery ended.  Segregation did exist also, that's ended for over 50 years now.  If you're problem with ""White supremacy and injustice,"" then I'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem.  Instead, educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice.",2923

9,"Why did Democrats choose the donkey for their mascot? ; Donkeys are asses and Elephants never forget. ; When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, his opponents tried to label him a ""jackass"" for his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson, however, picked up on their name calling and turned it to his own advantage by using the donkey on his campaign posters. During his presidency, the donkey was used to represent Jackson's stubbornness when he vetoed re-chartering the National Bank.\n\nThe first time the donkey was used in a political cartoon to represent the Democratic party, it was again in conjunction with Jackson. Although in 1837 Jackson was retired, he still thought of himself as the Party's leader and was shown trying to get the donkey to go where he wanted it to go. The cartoon was titled ""A Modern Baalim and his Ass"".\n\nInterestingly enough, the person credited with getting the donkey widely accepted as the Democratic party's symbol probably had no knowledge of the prior associations. Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist, came to the United States with his parents in 1840 when he was six. He first used the donkey in an 1870 Harper's Weekly cartoon to represent the ""Copperhead Press"" kicking a dead lion, symbolizing Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had recently died. Nast intended the donkey to represent an anti-war faction with whom he disagreed , but the symbol caught the public's fancy and the cartoonist continued using it to indicate some Democratic editors and newspapers.\n\nLater, Nast used the donkey to portray what he called ""Caesarism"" showing the alleged Democratic uneasiness over a possible third term for Ulysses S. Grant. In conjunction with this issue, Nast helped associate the elephant with the Republican party. Although the elephant had been connected with the Republican party in cartoons that appeared in 1860 and 1872, it was Nast's cartoon in 1874 published by Harper's Weekly that made the pachyderm stick as the Republican's symbol. A cartoon titled ""The Third Term Panic,"" showed animals representing various issues running away from a donkey wearing a lion's skin tagged ""Caesarism."" The elephant labeled ""The Republican Vote,"" was about to run into a pit containing inflation, chaos, repudiation, etc..\n\nBy 1880 the donkey was well established as a mascot for the Democratic party. A cartoon about the Garfield-Hancock campaign in the New York Daily Graphic showed the Democratic candidate mounted on a donkey, leading a procession of crusaders.\n\nOver the years, the donkey and the elephant have become the accepted symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. Although the Democrats have never officially adopted the donkey as a party symbol, we have used various donkey designs on publications over the years. The Republicans have actually adopted the elephant as their official symbol and use their design widely.\n\nThe Democrats think of the elephant as bungling, stupid, pompous and conservative -- but the Republicans think it is dignified, strong and intelligent. On the other hand, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn, silly and ridiculous -- but the Democrats claim it is humble, homely, smart, courageous and loveable.\n\nAdlai Stevenson provided one of the most clever descriptions of the Republican's symbol when he said, ""The elephant has a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by grasping the tail of its predecessor.""",2931

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

I called a few consolidation places, and debt settlement places but they want a payment of $500 a month and there is no way I can afford that. Does anyone know what I can do? ; Yes.If they've gone to collections or an attorney then they're on your report(s) and marked key derogatory or 30,60,90,120 days late.Sometimes the creditor will sell these written off accounts to resurgent companies.At that point you should contact the resurgent company and dispute with all three bureaus.\nOnce you dispute an account that's sold or written off the creditor has no claim to it anymore and will not reply to the dispute.Then the bureaus will remove the information.I did this very same thing and am paying Capital Management only 2477.00 back on 7079.00.They buy these accounts for just a few cents on the dollar and don't report to the bureaus.Resurgent companies don't want your credit ruined.\nBankruptcy is the very last resort.It screws up your credit almost as badly,and yes these bankruptcies go on your reports.\nBarring any of this contact an agency(like the ones you see commercials for) and they can help reduce your payments.I have to do this with my evil ex-wife because I unknowingly married into 27,000.00 of credit card debt.I think we used Credit Guard but I try to think of that experience as little as my failed marriage",3005

5,"Why do they bid to negotiate Japanese pitcher's? ; I don't understand why they have to negotiate to talk to Japanese pitcher's? who gets that money the player? We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

6,"what are the advantages and disadvantages of finance on a personal basis? ; i need information on if britain is becoming a debt ridden society and have to compare adv and dis ad ; The advantage of taking out a loan is that you keep whatever savings or capital that you may have intact, for other investment purposes. This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard. This is a very expensive use of money indeed!\n\nIn the UK, currently, a significant amount of personal debt is financed at high-ish interest rates. This makes the finance companies a lot of money but causes significant losses to the individual borrowing the money.",3137

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

I support the troops but I think the war is SO wrong. We have sunken to the level of the terrorists. We are holding people indefinately with no charges, no trial, no rights. I thought WE were supposed to be the civilized ones? Killing innocent civilians?!? WTF? I don't blame the sodiers, though. I blame the imbecile who sent them there for his own agenda, all the while thumping his Bible and preaching about moral values. Give me a break. What is happening to our country? It's amazing the damage this idiot has managed to do in six short years. Sorry to go on such a rant but watching the news and reading the newspapers makes me sick. The world is judging America and the American people based on the actions of this psychotic megalomaniac. ; (raises hand)\nI support our troops, but not the war. It's not a war. I think we're just terrorizing another nation into doing what we want them to do. I don't watch the news anymore. I hate seeing that we're killing so many innocents and being killed because they want to live their own way. I really don't like bush. He handled this thing really badly. It would have been one thing to go into Iraq to get the person responsible for 9/11. But it's a completely different thing to go into their country, destroy their cities, kill and imprison civillians for no reason, and stay there until they meet our demands.

7,"What is the life in the 80s like? ; I was born in 1990 and I never had experiences in the 1980s obviously but I watched many old movies and TV shows dated back in the 80s. Soon, I became very curious and wondered what life is like in the 80s. I visited the 80s nostalgia websites and I became obsessed with them! Sounds fun they were in the 80s. I just wanted to ask one thing... What life is like exactly in the 80s? Fun? Wacky? Regardless of the technology, which do you prefer...today or the 80s? and reason why? I'm even reporting my interests in the 80s in class, too! I hope you share your experiences with me and the other Yahoo users about the 80s. ; dude, i was born to answer this question. i loved the 80s. you really do not realize how much you miss something until it is gone. as with everything, age gives one a perspective. while living inside the decade, i didn't know i really cared. i'm not one to blab on and on, so i'll try keep it short. one of my very first memories is of the miracle on ice. i also remember hearing about john lennon getting shot. the significance of both was lost on me until i was a bit older. flew to LA to see the olympics in'84, the soviets boycotted since the usa did in 1980. Carl Lewis was the man. so was evil kneivel (sp?), that guy had big brass balls! \nwhile in school, the space shuttle Challenger blew up before my very eyes while we were watching the first teacher, christy mccauliffe, lifted into space. There were attempted assassinations of pope john paul II and president reagan.  there was always an air of fear due to nuclear arms and the cold war. the soviets were the enemy, that was that. watch the movie 'red dawn' for a perspective. it blew my mind when the berlin wall fell and so did the soviet union. I knew i was a witness to history, very cool. ronald reagan was the president. and since he was the president during my formative years, and i was taught to respect the office, love or hate the man, he was the example all the others had to live up to. i vaguely remember the iran hostage situation that preceded ronald reagan being elected.  \nmusic wise, my older brother was punk and I loved punk, ramones, dead kennedys and black flag to name a few. i was not a big fan of the electronic music, e.g., flock of seagulls, human league, until i got older and i realized it was a soundtrack to my youth. I was there when MTV started, i saw the first video they aired, video killed the radio star, or whatever. madonna's playboy issue was highly sought after. i used to be abe to run into the store to buy my father cigarettes, and a pack was less than a dollar! so much to talk about, i could go on forever.\ni miss the 80s because of the nostalgia, i was young and innocent and it seemed that the world was too. when you get older, you will miss your past and hopefully be passionate about it as much.",3243

You could leave a number as well. \n\nOr you could just walk up to this person and say, ""I'd like to go out with you as soon as possible"". This would require some balls but it would be worth it.\n\nOr you could get six of your friends together, tell each one to say one of the following words in order: ""will you go out with (your name)""? Get them to walk by this person, one after the other, each giving this person a rose when they walk by.

We both agree that buying a house is more important to us then getting married right now.  We still want an actual nice wedding ceromony, we don't want to get married at the courthouse just to facilitate buying a house.\nWe are planning on buying a house in Virginia or North Carolina.  Should we concentrate on buying a house or planning a wedding? ; It really depends on what kind of nuptial ceremony you plan on having?  Something informal with low overhead?  Then sure, get married first as that won't crunch the pocket book.  Now if you want a ""Cinderella"" wedding, then WAIT!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely purchase a house first!! Housing prices generally continue to go up, hence, equity in your pocket!! If you are worried about what family will say, who cares?? It's your life and you are only trying to better it!\n\nGood luck :)\n\nP.S......... purchasing a house sans marriage has absolutely NOTHING to do with who gets what should you seperate prior to getting married.  How you take title DOES!!  Should you purchase the home prior to marriage, you would each take title in your individual name, then after each of your names, you would state ""single man"" and ""single woman"" (assuming neither of you has been married before.  If either of you has been married before, then after that person's name it would say, ""unmarried man/woman"".  You would then have to decide that should one of you die before the other whether or not you want to leave your share of the house to the other person OR to someone else.  I'll give you an example of each:\n\nThis would be if both have never been married before AND want to leave the house to the surviving partner:\n\nJonh Doe- single man and Suzie Smith-single woman as joint tenants.\n\nNow if each of you would prefer to leave your half of the house to someone else, this is how you would take title (again, assuming neither of you has been married):\n\nJohn Doe-single man  (list his percentage of ownership) and Suzie Smith-single woman (list her percentage of ownership) with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this case, you would state in a will or trust or even on a notorized piece of paper, ""who"" your percentage of the house goes to. Also, in either example, if one of you has been married you would just change out ""single"" to read ""unmarried"".\n\nmb",3368

1,"How come when it rains, some times there's thunder and lightening with the rain and sometimes there's not? ; And how come sometimes there's wind with the rain and some times there's not? ; Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth. At the same time, it also is one of the least understood. While lightning is simply a gigantic spark of static electricity (the same kind of electricity that sometimes shocks you when you touch a doorknob), scientists do not have a complete grasp on how it works, or how it interacts with solar flares impacting the upper atmosphere or the earth's electromagnetic field.\nLightning has been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes. However, it is most often seen in thunderstorms.At any given moment, there can be as many as 2,000 thunderstorms occurring across the globe. This translates to more than 14.5 MILLION storms each year. NASA satellite research indicated these storms produce lightning flashes about 40 times a second worldwide.This is a change from the commonly accepted value of 100 flashes per second which was an estimate from 1925. Whether it is 40, 100, or somewhere in between, we live on an electrified planet.\n\nThe Sound of Thunder\nRegardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000°F (30,000°C), a temperature that is five times the surface of the sun! When lightning occurs, it heats the air surrounding its channel to that same incredible temperature in a fraction of a second.\n\nLike all gases, when air molecules are heated, they expand. The faster they are heated, the faster their rate of expansion. But when air is heated to 54,000°F in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon known as ""explosive expansion"" occurs. This is where air expands so rapidly that it compresses the air in front of it, forming a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. Exploding fireworks produce a similar result.\n\nWhat is the difference between a thundershower and a thunderstorm?  \nTechnically, there is none. In general, the term ""thundershower"" tends to denote a fairly weak storm with light to moderate rainfall and low levels of lightning activity. However, there are no defined parameters that distinguish between a thundershower and a thunderstorm. In fact, in order to avoid confusion, we in the National Weather Service do not use the term ""thundershower"". If a shower is strong enough to produce lightning, even just one single bolt, it's called a thunderstorm.\n\nTo Learn More about Lightning and Thunder go to \nhttp://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_intro.htm\n\nLIGHTNING SAFETY A MUST READ\nLightning is the MOST UNDERRATED weather hazard. On average, only floods kill more people. Lightning makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts.\n\nIn the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes COMBINED. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nLightning is one of the most capricious and unpredictable characteristics of a thunderstorm. Because of this, no one can guarantee an individual or group absolute protection from lightning. However, knowing and following proven lightning safety guidelines can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death. Remember, YOU are ultimately responsible for your personal safety, and should take appropriate action when threatened by lightning.\n\nWhile no place is 100% safe from lightning, some places are much safer than others.\nWhere to Go Where NOT to Go \nThe safest location during a thunderstorm is inside a large enclosed structure with plumbing and electrical wiring. These include shopping centers, schools, office buildings, and private residences.\n\nIf lightning st",3565

The spermatophore is typically reserved for the more primitive insects like collembola (springtails) and other wingless varieties. Scorpions will also use spermatopheres, but once again they are fairly primitive.\nMany orthopterans will have a plug which they insert into the female which acts to block or inhibit any other males from mating, this is sometimes refered to as the spermatophore.

I already tried unistalling and re-installing WMP. Also, when I try to play Sims 2 I can't hear the background sounds. HELP! Please! ; Step 1: Checking volume and mute settings:\n\nThe volume setting for one or more sound devices might be disabled or set too low. Use the following steps to adjust volumes to their correct levels:\n\nIn Windows XP, click Start, and then click Control Panel.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel \nIn Windows XP, open Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices, and then click Sound and Audio Devices.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, open Sounds and Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab. \nIn Windows XP, click the Advanced button under Device Volume.\nIn Windows 98 and Me, click the Volume button under Sound Playback. \nRemove all checkmarks from Mute boxes at the bottom of the Master Volume window and adjust the volume setting slide bars to their highest positions. Close the Master Volume window and test for sound. If there is still no sound, go to the next Step. \n\nStep 2: Verifying the connections:\n\nUse the following steps to verify that the sound cables are properly connected from the speaker to the computer (cable connectors and plug assignments are normally color-coded to aid with connections).\n\nUnplug the sound cable. \nPlug headphones or one speaker directly into the speaker out connector on the back of the computer. The speaker out connector may have a symbol of a speaker \nor a circle with an arrow pointing out, or it may just say ""OUT"" next to it. Test for sound using the computer.

Sound should be restored after replacing the sound cable. If sound does not come back after replacing the cable, the sound card needs to be replaced because the speaker out connector is bad.\n\nStep 3: Configuring on-board sound in the BIOS:\n\nSome computers come with sound on the motherboard (on-board), and some computers use a sound card. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS has to be set according to your particular sound configuration. Perform the following steps to correctly configure the sound in the BIOS:\n\nLook at the back of your computer and use one of the following three items to determine the proper sound configuration and sound setting: \nIf the plugs for the speakers and microphones are located next to the parallel, serial, or USB ports, then the computer has on-board sound. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS should be Enabled. If the plugs for the speakers and microphone are located away from the other ports and sit in an area by themselves, the computer has a soundcard. The on-board sound setting (if there is one) in the BIOS should be Disabled. If the computer has sound plugs in both locations, a \nsoundcard has been added to the computer that already contains on-board sound. The on-board sound setting should be Disabled. To enter the BIOS, turn on the computer and when the first screen appears, press the F1 key repeatedly until the BIOS Setup screen opens. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to select the Advanced tab. Press the DOWN ARROW key to select Onboard Audio Options and press ENTER. If Onboard Audio Options is not available, select I/O Device Configuration and press ENTER.

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

That would be only fitting, after all.\n\n    And... failing any of that, then the next-best thing would be to simply turn Saddam loose with our apologies and reinstate him as President of Iraq.

(Too bad it had to cost anywhere between 100,000 and 600,000 innocent Iraqi lives (and those of around 3,000 of our troops) for us to get to this point.) ; Graig C, I don't believe that Saddam is going to be executed. His next trials will drag on for 2 more years until next president will forgive him. Bush only hyped Saddam's execution before the election for political purposes. Bush can't be charged for mass murdering innocent people and thousands of our troops because of the patriotic act he signed. That was indeed shrewed of the neoconservatives. Yes, Saddam was a bad dictator and perhaps deserves to be killed, but he was not the worst dictator. Why is Bush picking on Saddam? USA built him up and made him bad. Rumsfeldt dealt with Saddam and supported him in the past. USA saved Saddam's butt in the past from many assassinations designed by his Shiites rebels. They gave him all the weapons and chemicals to defend himself from those Shiites rebels. Now because Saddam refused to cooperate with the USA like Qaddafi did and because we need Saddam's oil, so he is no good? What about Sudan's President Al-Bashir, who is killing innocent people left and right in Darfur? What about Libya's president, Qaddafi the horrible dictator? What about Egypt's president, Mr. Mubarak, the selfish bad dictator? What about Syria's President, Mr. Al-Assad, who is killing and jailing his opponents every day? What about Saudi Arabia King and his Sheiks, who hate Christians and oppressing outsiders (not Saudis)? Should we invade their countries and execute those dictators as well? C'mon Republicans, Is this logical? It is fine if you want to bully people around and control the oil resources in the world, but this is not the way to do it. Brutal Military Action as we are experiencing, destroying other countries and killing innocent civilians does not match our Great American Values and Morals.

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

0,"What do you know about Furries or anthropomorphic role players? ; I am just wondering what the general opinions of people on this subject are. By the way, I posted a similar question once and it was removed. I REALLY hope it doesn't happen again. ; An object is ""anthropomorphic"" if it has been given human attributes; these usually include the capacity for rational thought, emotions, and an upright posture. An anthropomorphic animal, therefore is a hybrid that is somewhere between a human and the original species. \n\nExamples of furries abound, and these can surely cement the concept for any readers that stopped to re-read the above paragraphs... Most cartoon characters are furries (e.g. Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Wile E. Coyote, etc.). Many cartoon characters are quite removed from the actual animals; their caracatured forms still retain many animalistic traits, however, and this identifies them as furries. Many comic book characters (e.g. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Omaha the Cat Dancer, Usagi Yojimbo), movie characters (e.g. the Rippers in ""Tank Girl"", Barf in ""Space Balls""), and mascots (e.g. the San Diego Chicken and Smokey the Bear) are also, at a basic level, anthropomorphized animals. Finally, furries are also commonly found in artwork, literature, and mythology (I won't bother to list examples here; I think you've got the idea by now). These are diverse categories, and this is one reason that it is hard to develop a comprehensive notion of what constitutes a ""furry"". \n\nThe diversity of furries is due, in part, to the degree to which they are anthropomorphized. Some characters (such as Mickey Mouse) are modified and humanized to such a degree that they only bear a passing resemblance to the animal from which they were derived. Others, such as Smokey the Bear, still closely resemble an animal in appearance.",4088

One of our flyers is about 90 pounds, and we figured out an easier way to get more height out of her basket toss.  The two bases each grab their left wrist to make a right angle, and then grab the other bases wrist, to make a square.  The front spot holds underneath the hands, just like in a normal basket toss.  Now, the backspot counts off, 1, 2 - on 2, the backspot puts the flyer in the ""basket"" and the flyer stays their until ready to ""fire"".  Flyer should have their hands on the bases shoulders, elbows out, and shoulders square.  The backspot then grabs the back of the flyers ankles and counts off 1,2 - on two, everyone bounces once, and then throws the flyer in the air.  This gets more height because it allows the flyer to push off better instead of relying on the bases to throw her up in the air right away.\n\nEasy stunts for small girls could include small pyramids or small lifts without a backspot.  Take two bases and a flyer.  Set up one base in a pocket (deep lunge) and another across from her in a prep stance (bent knees, straight back, hands together with palms facing up.)  With both hands on the bases shoulders, the flyer sets one foot in the pocket and bounces into the other bases prep stance.  The base with the prep stance lifts and turns the flyers foot so the the base is now perpendicular with the pocket base and the the flyer now has one foot down in the pocket and one foot up in a prep sideways.  This looks good is you have two of them facing opposite directions.",4167

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

0,"What does it mean to be Emo? ; Can someone explain it to me. What would someone look like or what activies would they do? Can someone define it. I am a 31 year old housewife and i don't know exactly what this term means. ; Emo is short for emotional.  Now, in the society today, it has turned into a high school stereotype such as jocks, nerds, geeks, goths, and groups like that.  If someone were to be stereotyped as emo, they would generally keep to themselves, be more timid than others, and not really want to do anything about it.  The majority of kids who fit this stereotype generally like to listen to music.  They feel it helps them escape the stresses of reality.  Music has essentially become their anti-drug.  Most kids have jumped into this fad thinking it's cool for guys to wear girl pants and wear black and such, but hey, if they want to express themselves like that, more power to them.  Everyone, to an extent, is ""emo,"" considering it is derived from the word emotional, and if you're not emotional, you're not human.  \n\nLooks:  \n\n""Emo"" girls tend to have shorter hair with sweeping bangs that cover one eye.  \n\nGuys tend to wear tighter jeans with the same hair cut.\n\nPiercings on the face are usually a big thing.

1,"Please tell me what we did wrong with this proof.  The question is:Let a,b and c be integers such that c.....? ; divides a*b. Then either c divides a or c divides b.\nFirst, we tried a bunch of examples, like when c=3 and ab=27, so a =3 and b=9, and you see that c divides a and c divides b.  Or another one is when c=7 and ab=56, so a=7 and b=8, and we know that 7 divides 56 and also 7 divides 7. Also, if c=12 and a=5 and b=24, then ab=120, and you see that c divides 120, and slo c divides b, which is all we need because the conjecture is an ""or"" statement so we only need one of the conditions to be true.  So we decided that the conjecture is true. Proof: Let a,band c be integers. We will prove the conjecture by contrapositive. So we assume that c doesn't divide a and that c doesn't divide b. We will show that c doesn't divide a*b. Since c doesn't dived a, then we know that a doesn't = c*m. Also, c doesn't divide b, so we know that b doesn't = s*n. So ab doesn't = (cm)(cn)=c(cmn). Now, cmn is an integer q(since c,m and n are all integers).Thus ab doesn't = cq for any int q. So c doesn't divide ab. ; Well, the basic problem you've run into is that the conjecture isn't true.  If a = 6, b = 3, and c = 9, then a*b = 18, and 18/9 = 2, but neither 6 nor 3 is divisible by 9.\n\nTo prove that something is true you must prove it is true for all possible values of the variables, in this case a, b, and c.  However, to prove something is false, you need only supply a single counter-example.  Thus the above example disproves the conjecture that for all integers a, b, and c if a*b is divisible by c then a or b is also divisible by c.\n\nNote that a ≠ cm and b ≠ cn does not imply that ab ≠ c(cmn).  For example, if a = 6, b = 8, c = 2, m = 4, and n = 3, then cm = 2*3 = 8 ≠6 so cm ≠ a, and cn = 2 * 3 = 6 ≠ 8 so cn ≠ b.  However, (cm)(cn) = 2 * 4 * 2 * 3 = 48, and a * b = 6 * 8 = 48, so ab = (cm)(cn).  This proves that you cannot multiply not-equalities (i.e. statements with ""doesn't equal).\n\nAlso, concluding that if c does not divide a or b implies that c does not divide ab is not the same as concluding that if c does divide ab it must also divide a or b.  This logical fallacy is equivalent to the statement that for all plants, not a tree implies not a rock, so being a rock implies being a tree.  The first statement is true: all plants that are not trees are also not rocks.  However, the second statement is clearly false, as no rocks are also trees.",4219

7,"How is blues guitar the basis for modern rock guitar? ; I was watching an instructional vid by marty friedman, and he said that you HAVE to know how to play the blues progression because all modern rock is based on it. Can anyone explain this deeper? ; That's a bit of an exaggeration.  Early rock-and-roll drew from the blues, but also from R&B and country music.  When hard rock developed in the mid-'60s, it was based almost exclusively on the blues.  Artists like the Rolling Stones (""Little Red Rooster"" is an especially good example), Cream/Eric Clapton (""Sunshine of Your Love""), and Jimi Hendrix, (""Hey Joe""), built the foundation for hard rock, and the heavy metal that developed out of it, on an exaggerated electric blues.  Though the more sophisticated hard-rock and metal bands of the seventies incorporated other influences (British folk for Led Zeppelin, jazz for Led Zeppelin), most, like Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, continued to build on the blues base.  While subsequent rock artists have drawn on influences as diverse as free-jazz and avant-garde strains of 20th century classical, especially in more underground and experimental veins, mainstream rock music has never stopped drawing on the blues, passed along from one generation to the next.",4256

They need a safer place to make a cocoon and pupate so they dangle until it feels right and then, hopefully, the wind will blow them into a lower, warmer and safer place to spend the winter in their cocoon. In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look.

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

Do you know how this condition is treated? ; Commonly known as pinkeye, conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white part of the eye and lines the inner surface of the eyelids. It is a fairly common condition and usually causes no danger to the eye or your child's vision. The inflammation can have many causes, the most common of which are infectious, allergic, and irritant.  Since your son's eyelashes are full of a crusty discharge it is likely that the cause is bacterial and will need an antibiotic eye drop.  If you cannot get him to a doctor immediately a warm washcloth will help.  When you start on the eye drops be sure to continue using them for 3 to 5 days after his eyes clear up or else you may risk having the infection return.",4425

You will have to repress your feelings of intellectual analysis.

Such people are going to be necessary to the modern world of clashing religious groups.\n\nBut if you start with the academic study, and you continue to feel it is appropriate for you, then phone a local Muslim organization and ask them what to do.  Accept that they may be suspicious of you for a while; things are tense in the religious world between Muslims and the mostly Christian world.  They see white skin, they may think spy.

Corrosive substances, such as cleaning solutions, can erode the esophagus if they are swallowed accidentally or deliberately, as in a suicide attempt. Some pills (for example, aspirinSome Trade Names\nECOTRIN\nASPERGUM\nor other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alendronateSome Trade Names\nFOSAMAX\n, doxycyclineSome Trade Names\nVIBRAMYCIN\n, and certain large iron and potassium tablets) can cause painful erosions if they lodge temporarily in the esophagus.\n\nDiagnosis of erosive esophagitis is made by esophagoscopy. If an erosion results from a pill, the pill usually can be washed down with large quantities of water; the pain often resolves within hours. Rarely, erosions caused by corrosive substances or pills persist, leading to narrowing of the esophagus.",4445

2,"is Ginkgo a good herbal suplement? ; has any one tried this before? ; Medical uses\nThe extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nOut of the many conflicting research results, there seem to be basically three effects of Ginkgo extract on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals (antioxidant); and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders. Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication.\n\n Side effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ginkgo should also not be used by people who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women without first consulting a doctor.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include: possible increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, and restlessness.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced consumption should be halted immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40–200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nAnd that's My Best Answer!",4465

1,"What is a derivative? antiderivative? ; THANX!! ; Derivative of a function is the study of microscopic and complex rate of change or infinitesimal rate of change of a curve, a process, a phenomena etc.Several changes have been taking place in this world,a macroscopic changes and uniform changes are easily countable, but complex changes are not easily accountable.To understand such changes we require the wonderful mathematical tool  called drivative, diffrentiation, diffrential etc.For example think of pouring  water into a conical vessel in drops.Here if the drops that are dripping in are uniform, it is easy to know the number of drops per minute, per hour etc.But it very difficult to find the rate of change of height of water  as the water drips in to the container (conical) and the corresponding rate of change of surface area of the water in the container.To understand such changes we move towards zero or towards a number which we call as the limit.Also a prosses may be a chemical reaction, in physics it may be a free fall of an object or an acclerated body.Moreover, consider y=x^2, the derivative of this is dy/dx = 2x, here change is not uniform as common difference in an arithmetic progression.\nWhen x=4 & 5 we have x^2= 16 & 25 ; then the difference is 9.Compare this 9 with the derivative 2x = 2*4 & 2*5 = 8 & 10.These numbers 1 more or less to 9.Of course the difference 1 is considerable when x is a small number. When x is sufficiently large this 1 becomes negligible.ie. limit as x tends to infinity the derivative of x^2 is 2x.  \nAnti-derivative is opposite to this concept. This is usually called as integration, summation, premitive etc. Here it is the study of complex accumulation.\nFor example when a point is accumulated in a single direction without break we call it a line, ie. when a point dx is integrated we get a line `x'.When line is intigrated we get a surface, that is x^2 /2. When the same is revesed we get a point . former is called integration later is called diffrentiation.",4481

1,"What are the economic and environmental considerations of materials? ; For materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. ; Economic Considerations\n\nResearch has shown that if the soil test is below the desired level, application of phosphorus will provide yield increases that will not only pay for the treatment, but also provide additional income beyond the cost of the treatment. If the soil test is above the cut-off point, i.e. more than 20 pounds above the desired level, it will be in the best interest of the farmer to invest his capital in inputs other than phosphorus as such an addition will not result in a yield increase.\n\nLand tenure and/or availability of capital also affect the economic rate of application. For those individuals that have limited or unknown tenure, or limited capital, it is suggested that they extend the build-up period from the recommended 4 year period to 6 years or in some cases longer. Other than for the most deficient soils, this will not have an adverse impact on yield.\nEnvironmental Considerations:\n\nThere is no documented evidence that excess phosphorus in water supplies creates a human health hazard. Rather, when phosphorus enters surface waters in substantial concentration, it becomes a pollutant by contributing to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants, and, thus to accelerated eutrophication of surface waters.\n\nEutrophication is the process where through nutrient enrichment of surface waters, algae and other aquatic plant growth is increased. This associated increase in aquatic plant growth and their ultimate decomposition limits the use of surface waters for recreation, fisheries, industry, and drinking. In most water bodies, phosphorus is the element most limiting for plant growth. When critical concentrations of phosphorus are exceeded by environmental pollution, eutrophication occurs. The critical concentration of phosphorus for eutrophication that is frequently cited is 0.01 parts per million (ppm).\n\nPhosphorus contamination of surface waters comes from point source emissions (industry and waste water from sewage treatment systems) and non-point sources with agriculture being the primary non-point source. Over the last couple of decades, point source contamination has been markedly decreased. As a result, agriculture has been designated as the primary source of phosphorus entering surface waters. The primary mechanisms by which agriculture contributes phosphorus to surface water is through runoff and erosion. Movement of phosphorus through tile does occur on sandy and organic soils and through macropores of fine textured soils. Studies in the U.S. have found very low concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in tile line effluents, but frequently they exceed a projected critical value of 0.01 ppm phosphorus. If the sorption capacity of the profile of a fine textured soil were to become phosphorus saturated to near the depth of tile lines, there would be a continual excessive supply of bioavailable phosphorus in that tile line outflow. If accepted agronomic practices are followed for phosphorus management, phosphorus released in tile line flow will be minimal.\n\nPhosphorus from agricultural sources enters the stream as either dissolved phosphorus or particulate phosphorus. Dissolved phosphorus is comprised mostly of orthophosphate which is immediately available for uptake by algae. Particulate phosphorus is attached to soil and organic matter particles and as such is not immediately available for plant use. The fate of particulate phosphorus is dependent on the characteristics of the receiving water body. If the existing sediment is low in phosphorus, a portion of the dissolved phosphorus may be sorbed to the sediment. However, if the sediment entering the water body is high in particulate phosphorus, a portion of it may be desorbed into dissolved phosphorus over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThere are several factors that influence the rate of movement of phosphorus from agricultural lands. These include inherent soil phosphorus level, tillage, ground cover, rate and method of applicat",4583

BUT, if you have a mental illness which can be purely organic/biological then cutting is a symptom of some pretty serious personality disorders.

1,"If the core of a nuclear plant went critical(china syndrome) would it actually melt it's way to china? ; This is prob a stupid question, I just saw the movie and I missed the explanation of the result of a china syndrome. ; All nuclear plants that are producing power must be ""critical.""  The plant is shut down when it is ""subcritical.""  A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes ""supercritical.""  A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it.  A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world (like anything else that falls).  Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe, the core would fall toward China, thus the China syndrome.  Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth.  For those with a wild imagination, China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core.  None-the-less, China Syndrome is a catchy phrase.",4732

2,"Is there anyone who is suffering from Phobia or how u get recover from that?  Your answer is mostly appreciate ; Looking forwards to hear from you, for I need ur support! ; I feel sorry for your anxiety caused by your phobia and for the other people writing about their phobias in your answer column. I to have suffered with many different phobias; as a child it was injections (both dentists and doctors), and Dogs; now it is the feeling of fear itself that I fear. (Because of years of panic attacks)\n\nI can tell you what helps, if you need to take an oral pill (tranquilizer) if you are really bad (one every night before going to bed for a short time) or (half an hour before you need to go to the doctor for an appointment involving an injection). \n*However this will not teach you too become brave or help you cope with your underlining fear which has become a phobia. \n\nI suggest you learn to relax through different sources.\n\nFirstly you can do positive self talk as your fear comes from negative thoughts causing you to have a chemical release in the brain which in turn causes the physical sensations of heart racing, sweating, feelings of faintness, fear, anxiety, nausea, light headedness, numbness, and so on…..oh yeah feelings of unreality is another one.\n\nNext learn relaxation or meditation either through physical participation in yoga classes or by listening to these sorts of cd, tape, or videos. There are hypnotic and relaxation available through JB Hi Fi stores designed to relax and strengthen your subconscious.  Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.  However this option is the most expensive and time consuming because it takes many sessions and time to feel you can trust or open up fully to another person.\n\n\n\n*If you use drugs as a crutch you can become addicted and that would start a whole new problem. \nP.S. the side affects of many tranquilizer drugs are feelings of anxiety and panic which you don’t want anyway.\n\n*The body is affected the same with legal and illicit drugs (downers or relaxants) like tranquillizers, sleeping pills or (marijuana, heroin, and alcohol) \n*Stimulants which are (speed, & cocaine) (cigarettes = nicotine), (tea & coffee =caffeine), and (ice & ecstasy which is often a combination of both stimulants and relaxants). \n*Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Marijuana are most accepted by the general public however they cause the most disease related deaths. Through internal organ diseases, like *Cancers and Blood clots (causing amputations, strokes and heart attacks) \n*Lung diseases from asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer.  \n*Liver diseases from damage trying to alienate the body of toxic poisons and chemicals associated with medications and alcohol over years. \n*Hepatitis, sclerosis, and cancers of the liver.  \n*Marijuana has a chemical THC which our body has receptor in our brain and we also store for long periods in our blood and fat cells; (up to one month each time you smoke just one joint). Regular bong smokers and users will cause many different chronic health problems including lung disease (as the same toxic chemicals are in tobacco and marijuana excepting nicotine which is a stimulant) mental health suffers with paranoia, anxiety, fear, loss of memory, loss of appetite or increased appetite for sweets, loss of motivation, poor health, poor sleeping patterns and a dependency to use marijuana to get to sleep. Personal hygiene problems like sweating, bad breath and rotting teeth and the best for last you only feel mellow for a short time the rest of the time you are short tempered and unbearable to be around.\n*All drugs both legal and illicit have one thing in common the same side affects which is anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.",4735

5,"facts about javelen? ; history ; Javelin throw\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nA high school athlete throwing the javelin.The javelin throw is an athletics (track and field) throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fibreglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber. Because of its potential danger, it is not always included in track and field meets; for instance, Michigan high school track and field does not include javelin.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Competition and throws \n2 Javelin redesigns \n3 History and the javelin at the Olympics \n4 World records \n5 Famous Javelin Throwers \n5.1 Women \n5.2 Men \n5.3 Top Ten longest throwers of all time (current 1986 model)- men \n \n\n\n[edit]\nCompetition and throws\nRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws or six when they are placed to the eighth position, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimeter. The javelin's point must touch the ground first for the throw to be legal. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface from which they must release the javelin. The run-up culminates in a 40 degree fan emanating from a point 8m behind the line. Throws are measured from the point of landing to the inside of the painted line with the measuring tape co-linear with the point of landing and the focal point of the fan. Javelin throwers also normally use spikes unlike other throwers, with eleven small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.\n\nJavelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more similar physical characteristics to those athletes rather than the bulky frames of the strength throwers. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 70 mph (113 km/h).\n\n[edit]\nJavelin redesigns\nIn 1986, the men's javelin (800 g) was redesigned because of the prodigious distances being thrown culminating in a world record throw of over 104m by the then East German thrower, Uwe Höhn. The javelin throw was in danger of being banished to outside the arena on safety grounds so the javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved further away from the centre of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act) so that the javelin had a downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% and also causing the javelin to stick in. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g) was similarly redesigned.\n\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.\n\n[edit]\nHistory and the javelin at the Olympics\nThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1908. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. The objective there, however was to throw at a target rather than for distance.\n\n[edit]\nWorld records\nThe world record for men, at 98.48 meters, is held by Jan Železný from the Czech Republic, set at Jena, Germany, on May 25, 1996. The world record for women, at 71.70 meters, is held by Osleidys Menéndez from Cuba, set at Helsinki, Fi",4760

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree. And when the stomata (the hole on the underside of the leaf) opens for gas exchange, one water molecule at a time evaporates from the leaf, thus pulling the chain up one by one.

1,"why do candles wax look clear when hot but not clear when cold? ; when it cools down it fogs and just blanks ; Let's see if I can handle this...candles are (mostly) made from petroleum-based materials that are prized for their ability to easily change from solid to liquid by the application of heat.  When solid, the molecular bonds of the material are so dense that they let little or no light pass between them, thus the ""milky"" appearance of the wax.  When heated, the molecular bonds of the material are so broken apart that they easily allow light to pass through and so appear ""transparent.""",4887
5,"Any Ideas On What To Do On The Weekends With Your Husband And 5 Month Baby When It Is .? ; LIKE GOING TO THE ZOO,SHOPPING,ECT. ; A five month old wouldn't enjoy the zoo, but if you want to go, five months is a good time if the baby can sleep in a stroller. If your little one must take a nap in her/his crib, then forgo the long outing. Five month old babies are amused by anything, as you know, but only in small doses. I think you should try to find local places that take only a short drive to and from - that way you maximize your time at the place you want to be, and your baby probably won't fall asleep in the car on the way back if it's a short trip. I recommend just staying in your yard (if you have one) and playing or gardening; there are lots of things outside that would interest a five month old. Buy a bag of rice and dump it in a bowl; let him/her mess around with it outside, then hose it away when s/he is done. Buy a flat of cheap annuals along with whatever other flowers/vegetables you would like to grow; give your baby a clump of flowers (minus much of the soil) and let him destroy them (it's a great learning experience). You may want to take off his clothes before you do that.  :o)  The thing about outings with a baby is it can be more tiring than you may think.",4892

1,"Is this possible? ; Say there is a line of several car-hauling semitrucks with ramps down at road-level in a straight line driving down a straight stretch of road.  Each truck is going just a bit faster than the truck in front of it.  Also, there is, say, a Geo Metro behind the last truck.  If it were timed just right, by having the Metro drive up onto the ramp of the one semi just as that semi drove onto the ramp of the semi in front of it, etc., is it conceivable that the Metro could break the sound barrier?\n\nIt seems that relative to the ground, the metro will be gaining the speed of each truck in the line.  If the car and trucks are each going around 60mph, and there are 9 trucks, presumably the car could go around 600mph relative to the ground.\n\nI know this seems silly.  Maybe doing this with only one truck would be a better case to consider.  Is even that feasible?  Or am I missing some major practical drawback here? ; How would the last Truck hold all the weight!?!?",4904

So, x^n + y^n = (x^q)^p + (y^q)^p can be factored. Example: x^44 + y^44 = (x^4)^11 + (y^4)^11 has x^4 + y^4 as a factor.\n\nThat only leaves x^(2^n) + y^(2^n): x^2 + y^2, x^4 + y^4, x^8 + y^8, ... None of these can be factored, using Eisenstein's criteria.\n\nIn the above I assume that all coefficients are integers.

0,"Is there a word in Japanese that sounds like ""quantify?""  If so, what does it mean? ; My boss made a presentation to a group of Japanese people.  Everytime he said ""quantify,"" they would giggle.  Does it sound like something in Japanese? ; This is a tough one.  How does your boss pronounce the word?\n\nOften, people change the ""t"" in ""quantify"" to a softer ""d"" sound so it sounds like ""kwandifai.""\n\nOthers leave it out entirely so it sounds like ""kwannifai.""\n\nIn both cases, they start with kwan, which sounds to me like ""kuwan"" an informal form of the verb ""kuu"" which means to eat.  To eat is usually translated to ""taberu"" but ""kuu"" has a baser hungrier meaning.  That sounds giggle-worthy to me.  :-)\n\nThere aren't any words that are close to ""nifai"", but ""fai"" by itself is close to ""faibu"" (the final bu is not always very loud), which means ""five.""\n\nI remember a similar incident while I was teaching English at a Japanese Junior High and every time I said ""Ready, set, GO!""  the class would giggle.  It turned out that the rhythym of the words was very similar to a slogan for a popular moth repellant on TV that went ""Tansu ni GON!""  \n\nI didn't think it was funny / similar at the time, but something like that could have been going on their heads.

3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

2,"Milk... cancer? ; I happen to hear this rumor about milk being a cause of Cancer.. I looked it up in google and found quite a few links regarding this... it comes to me as a shock... Is it True?? ; Cow's milk doesn't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe worst part about cow's milk is the process it goes through to get from the cow's udder to your grocery store.   Typically, it is altered beyond recognition.  It is standardized, fortified, pasteurized and homongenized.  In other words, it has been taken apart and put back together again, not always in the same proportions. Then it will be cooked and emulsified.\n\nHowever, many humans actually have mild allergies to the substance, which is nutrionally incompatible with their bodies.  In these cases, milk consumption can trigger acne outbreaks, sinusitis, constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nOn the other hand, those who experience no allergic reactions can drink it with no problems, and will wholeheartedly stand out on the streets and proclaim, ""Milk is good for you!  Drink it by the gallon!""  And for them, it may be.  But it's not for everyone.\n\nSo, what transforms an otherwise  healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens?  It all starts with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass; and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than they a traditional cow.\n\nThen, the cows are given antibiotics to keep them well. Their milk is then pasteruized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed; lactase, which assimilates lactose; galactose, which  assimilates galactose; phosphatase, for the assimilation of calcium. Literally dozens of precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteruization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to disease.\n\nHope this helped explain it a little better.  Raw, organic, whole cow's milk is in no way cancer-causing.  It's really more the process it goes through to become store-ready that could, in a sense, contribute to cancer development in some people.",4966

I agree with 'andytheba..' and 'itschris', above. The line represents the STRING (top line = highest note-thinnest string, bottom line = lowest note-thickest string) \n\nThe numbers DO refer to the fret number (0 = open or un-fretted string/ 1= 1st fret on that particular string 2= 2nd fret and so on and so forth) Where a number repeats ---2-3-5-5-5-5-5--- , this indicates the number of time you pluck or pick the string\n\nTabs are designed primarily to help guide you through a A PIECE OF RECORDED MUSIC YOU EITHER KNOW OR HAVE ACCESS TO. Tabs sometimes, though rarely, contain some musical information. This is similar  to standard musical notation. A large number of tabs, however, just provide you with the basic information and you use the recording to to reference it.\n\nAn example :  ----0-2-3-5--- played on the A string (second fattest) is telling you to play the notes A, B, C and D. If the numbers read ----0-2-4-5--- they would be telling you to play the notes A, B, C# and D.   Since you already read standard music notation - the piano music - you have a glorious head start but, as I said, alot of Tablature (tabs) dispenses with all the note value notation and provides you with just the 'finger pathway' through the music you listen to or want to learn.

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness. It is often brought on by stressful situations, such as relationship difficulties, health problems, the aftermath of an accident or the death of a loved one. \n\nThe mental illness known as a ""nervous breakdown"" may also be something like panic attacks, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder. \n\nSurveys show that about one-third of Americans feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown at some point. Studies estimate that 50-million Americans suffer some form of mental illness in their lifetime. \n\nThere are many disorders that can fit within the criteria of ""Nervous Breakdown"", but those that most commonly occur are those related to:\n•Anxiety \noGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \noPanic Disorder \n•Panic Attacks \n•Trauma Disorders \noPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder \noAcute Stress Disorder \n•Psychotic Disorders \noSchizophrenia \n•Mood (Affective) Disorders \noDepression \noBipolar Disorder",5073

2,When i have sex with my wife i usually come within 30 seconds? ; When i have sex with my wife i usually come with in 30 seconds and then we usually never try the second time.\nCan you guys really help me how to solve my problem ; Did you practise holding back when you masturbated growing up. Basically every time I masturbated growing up I'm practising holding back and recognizing the feeling of getting close then backing off. Its just slowing down or slightly changing your rhythm. Its a practise thing. Also pulling out (if slowing down doesn't help) and tapping your glans (tip) against your wife's vagina will stop you from climaxing if you are getting close. (the part facing away from your belly button) Other ways to help prevent climax. Wear a condom. Masturbate relatively often or have sex more often. I have a much harder time holding back if I haven't ejaculated in a while. Experiment with your body in this regard. They also have creams that supposedly delay climax. I've never tried them so I don't know how effective they are. The solution is in here. Good luck.,5093

The question on the exam asked what was NOT in plasma: oxygen, fibrin protein, antibody, or electrolyte? ; Plasma contains a very small fraction of oxygen.Almost all oxygen is loaded in the RBC.Fibrinogen has to be converted into fibrin and this is possible when the platelets rupture to release thrombokinase.This enzyme converts prothrombin into thrombin which acts upon firbrinogen to convert it into fibrin.However this is dangerous as much of fibrin in the plasma will block the flow of blood in the  blood vessel.The blood clot is bunch of fibrin molecules.

If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.

The symptoms have continued ever since. I seem to be in a constant state of decline regarding my mood - how do I determine wether it is really S.A.D. and not just regular depression? It doesn't seem to occur at particular times of year, and I'm not sure if an overcast day affects it or not, I live in a rainy city so it's overcast a lot. Was the doctor wrong? ; You can have symptoms of depression with SAD even in summer months if it is overcast.  People who live in areas of the world that only get sun for limited times during the day or year can sometimes experience the symptoms year round.  A common treatment for SAD, in addition to meds, is to give the person a light source for the home that mimics the sun's rays.  Have you ever tried this?

However, script problems eventually caused that project to be scrapped. Finally, in August 2004 he inked a deal to join the cast of ""The West Wing"" for the 2004-2005 season, and a few weeks later, made a separate deal with ABC and Touchstone studios to develop and star in a new series after his time on ""The West Wing.""\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPersonal quotes \n""They'd say, 'Explain this again: If you finish this degree, you'll be able to teach high-school drama?'"" -- Former ""NYPD Blue"" on his parents' reaction after he told them he wanted to be an actor - USA Weekend (August 1999)\n\n""Celebrity hits like a bomb.

0,"Apologetics, No. 4:  If we all evolved then why are there still apes? ; This is a common question asked by people who are not familiar with the concept of evolution.\n\nThe evidence from the fossil record, from genetics, from molecular biology and so on, is that we are a species of ape, closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas, less closely related to other primates, less closely still to other mammals, and so on.  The reason that there are still other apes is that they and we had a common ancestor several million years ago.  Chimpanzees, for example, have evolved just as much in the intervening time as we have - Biologists do not say that chimps or monkeys we see today are our ancestors, as is sometimes mistakenly claimed.\n\nHence the ""why are there still apes?"" question is invalid, and due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nAgreed? ; Yep.

Go with a natural fit, don't force yourself to try and love computers just because you think it's the most successful route. After you have that hammered out, find out what is in demand in your area or someplace that you want to move (yes, there are unemployed engineers with skills that don't fit the location). An easy way to do this is look at some of the job boards and find out what types of engineers people are hiring. \n\nPicking a school: this is VERY important. You must make sure the engineering school is ACCREDITED by ABET. Anyone can legally hand out non-accredited engineering degrees. ABET schools are a whole different ballgame. Don't waste your time and money! \n\nOk, you picked a school, great! At this point, there are 3 things you need to do: 1. keep your GPA over 3.2. 2. Join at least one engineering association that fits your discipline (ASME, SAE, ACM, AUVSI...many to choose from). 3. Participate in internships and/or co-ops.

5,"What can be done to fix the BCS? ; The BCS is the biggest crock ever conceived. As of the Week 12 ranking, there are some inexplicable rankings. USC: 3rd? I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th). Furthermore, the Pac-10 as a league is laughable, they have one or two powerhouses that basically play scrimmages for a season and have an easy roll into the BCS bids. Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid. A playoff system needs to be established to discover a true champion, maybe use the bowl games as the playoffs leading to an ""Uber"" bowl game. Preferences should cease being given to bigger schools, both in rankings and officiating, by my count USC should've lost at least 2 other times. What say You! ; 8 team playoff in three weeks.  \n\nBut, with the system now, why should you play for the championship if you can't even beat the teams in your conference?

The ability to adapt the poses with props can be particularly beneficial with multiple sclerosis (MS), since flare-ups can affect strength, balance, and coordination. \nIt’s also important for you to know about a very unique Iyengar teacher, Eric Small (located in the Los Angeles area), whose personal story of developing MS in his late teens and reclaiming his health through his study with Mr. Iyengar is almost legendary. His experience eventually led him to work with the National MS Society to create a yoga teacher-training program for teachers who want to work with students with MS. I was fortunate enough to participate in this course in 2001 with Eric as the lead instructor. \n\nStudying with an MS-trained instructor can improve your chances of moving through the practice at an appropriate pace for whatever stage of the MS cycle you may find yourself in. In addition, you will learn specific sequences designed for challenges such as fatigue, constipation, problems with digestion, lack of mental clarity, or balance. Balance, for example, can be addressed with asanas such as Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Virabhadrasana I (Warrior Pose I) and Virabhadrasana II (Warrior Pose II), and Trikonasana (Triangle Pose). \n\nFor a student with MS, there are three types of symptoms that hatha yoga directly addresses: fatigue and heat intolerance, numbness in the limbs and loss of coordination, and loss of flexibility and balance. Fatigue and heat intolerance appear to be the most limiting factors to MS students. To counter these limitations, students learn to master the breath and practice restorative postures. Both techniques cool the body and calm the nervous system. The simple breathing technique of lengthening the exhalation a little longer than the inhalation helps quiet the nervous system. It’s been observed that heat, stress, and tension can cause temporary worsening of MS symptoms, so keep the pace of practice relaxed but focused—keeping the body just shy of sweating is important. \n\nMS can also result in a daily battle with numbness of the arms and legs, muscle spasms, and loss of coordination. The system of yoga emphasizes stretching and breathing, which can release tension and improve circulation and body awareness. Yoga practice can also facilitate harmony between the muscular and nervous systems of the body, possibly resulting in more fluid movement and relief from muscle tension. As a student’s level of body awareness improves, she can begin to recognize the first signs of stress on her system before it overwhelms her. \n\nFinally, in addition to evolving body awareness, yoga increases flexibility and balance. The poses increase the range of motion in the joints and improve muscle tone, and work of most of the body’s muscle groups. \n\nYour yoga practice can be tailored according to your needs. If you are in a period of remission and your balance is intact, you can often do most of poses practiced in an ordinary class setting. During periods of relapse, stay in the groove of practicing by doing a modified practice, for example lying supine on the floor or utilizing chairs and the wall. \n\nThe effect of hatha yoga on MS is of such great interest that the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine division has funded a study of the effects of yoga on MS patients. Preliminary data shows improvement speci",5512

Anointing was the inaugural ceremony for priests\n\nI think the latter portion of the definition is the most applicable to this usage.  As you know, all Born Again believers are priests according to the Order of Melchizedek, with Jesus as our High Priest.  This ""chrisma"" is given to us at the time we're saved to show we're approved priests.  This annointing includes the giving of spiritual gifts.  The only difference is that the annointing shows we're priests; the gifts permit us to carry out an individual ministry to the glory of God. \n\nPeace.",5534

PLEASE HELP! ; I don't know what Php mean.. I guess you are somewhere outside of the United States.\n\nAnyway, let me explain what an investment in a life policy is. First, this investment is not for your retirement. This investment is known as a ""cash value"" in the life insurance industry. If you wanted to use it anytime, you will have to borrow it and pay back with interest. This interest does not go back into your investment, but rather kept by the insurance company. If you miss any premiums or decide to stop paying in the future, the insurance company will use your cash value to pay for it. When you die, you will lose all cash value and your family will only get the death benefit.\n\nWhat I would do? Buy a 30 year term policy with Php500,000 coverage. You said you want to invest in real estate. You may do that, but I recommend investing in mutual funds too. When your term policy expires, you probably won't need life insurance if you invest wisely and continue to put away money each month.",5548

I weigh about 200 pounds and throw anywhere from 75-78 with my fastball. I have never been really instructed on how to use my body in pitching, so I know I'm throwing almost all with my arm. I have very long, strong legs with big calves and thighs. I was wondering what there was to do to develop or gain speed on my fastball?\n\nOther information:\nI have a three quarters arm slot\ndo not have a high leg kick (like clemens does)\nMy arms are very weak, I have little muscle in them\nI'm almost done growing. X-Rays revealed growth plates were almost closed. I have about an inch to gain.\n\n\nI have a good curve and cutter and a two seamer that moves about two feet down and away to left handers, so I just need to boost my speed. Accuracy is there also. At the level I'm at, I am able to blow away batters and strike out 7-10 a game, but I want to be able ot play in college. ; First off you have good height strong upper body helps but pitching is 30% body strength 70% technique ask yourself these questions \n\n1.do i have good balance from the point of my rotation into my stride.\n\n2.am I using full arm motion = on a 360 degree scale wich means are you releasing the ball at the top point into your stretch.\n\n3.you say you have long legs that is a good tool for alot of pitchers. question from me to you. So I can be a bit more helpful . After you go into your stretch from the wind up what is the position of your trail leg into your stretch do have a habbit of pushing off the mound . Not good gets you into bad habbits .Its more like a pulling off the mound into the stride then pushing into the release . \nA good practice for this is stand at the mound go into your routine simulate your movements to the place go step by step every motion check your body position into each step. Break it down steps 1 to 5  \n\n1.your starting stance Check your balance \n2.your raise into your windup check balance look at your footing \n\n3. from windup into your stride check balance arm position did you get proper waist rotation did you push off the mound. \n\n4 look at your arm are you at your right release point .is it in correct position if not at a perfect point gonna cause loss of velocity and cause improper control of the pitch.\n\n5 check your balance after the stretch do you still have proper balance.\n \n\n\ncauses balance issues and takes away from your volicity and has a tendency of causing alot of wild pitches. Do you see  \n  yourself with this problem?\n\nThe leg kick is a tool but if you dont have balance from the kick to the stride your wasting your time .\n\n4. Do you have proper waist rotation going from windup to the stretch this is important. (note) proper hip motion=rotation) if your not balanced going from your turn into the stride this will cause a potential  loss of velocity thats where alot of power pitchers    get this down to tee.\n\nYou say you have a 3qtr arm slot question when you release the ball at what point of your stride are you release what is your arm position .Always release the ball at the top of you stride Balance+  release point = velocity .I hope this gives you some ideas on  where your at or where you need to be at .Please feal free to e-mail question's if you have any .Id be glad to help",5578

1,"did all of us use to be africans, like forever ago? ; i have seen this discovery channel presentation that features ""the real eve comes from africa"", hence making all of us africans by origin. ; It's a matter of debate. There are two broad theories regarding the origin of modern humans.\n\nThe most widely accepted theory is that we are all descended from a small population of Africans that originated around 120, 000 years ago. If that theory is correct then we are all descendants of Africans fairly recently.\n\nThe second theory is that  different human groups evolved from different pre-human ancestors. So people in south east Asia evolved from Homo erectus in that part of the world, people in western Europe evolved form Neanderthals and people in southern Africa evolved from local erectus populations there. Since then the various populations have commingled and interbred. If that theory is correct then there may well be people with little or no recent African ancestry.",5636

I haven't got it back yet... do I have a case? ; Since the nature of the case, that you were not intoxicated, and that no test was preformed, I would take the Sheriff or Sheriff's to court, in the majority of the outcome of them actually going to court (depends on the county and state) but a lot of legal athority do not show up for court, they are not required.

Please remember to add the link. Thank you! ; this is one answer\nHowever, the rather terrible curse may have had a more benign origin. Much earlier in stage history, when superstition had a less frightening hold on the craft, actors and their followers used a more gracious greeting: ""May you break your leg,"" by which it was meant that the evening's performance would be of such grandeur that the actor would be obliged to break his leg - that is bend his knee - in a deep bow acknowledging the audience's applause.",5661

You didn't say how the ex feels about you. Why does she deny him seeing his child? Because I do not know if my answer will help if you don't have the same life I had. The ex hated me and didn't mind telling everyone she knew. She thought I was the root of their separation. I didn't even know my now husband at the time they 1st broke up. I had been going with him for about 5 months when I found out that he wasn't DIVORCED! So for that reason she used us being together as what was wrong with their relationship. She told everyone that Mike drank all the time and that she didn't trust him being alone with his son. When really it was a way to punch him for leaving her. The reason for not getting a divorce right away, he didn't want them to cancell their medical insurance. Dumb then...we played her game for many months. Then I started checking things out. He could get the divorce, keep insurance on his kid, pay child support (a must) and the court would let him have his son every other weekend. If she didn't produce the child..She could go to jail. So Check it out where you leave. Your man may want to make the divorce legal...Now to the other part of your question..Why does she have to be there..Just to piss you off more than likely. She will dress up and look great. As if to say..see what you are missing. Have him get a divorce..then the ball is back in your court.

Take a couple of copies when you gather and return applications and if you get asked to an interview. If you have never held a job before, you can list volunteer work, pertinent after school activities and self employment such as lawn mowing or baby sitting. Under education, list the school you are attending and any awards or achievements you have obtained.\n- Make sure you have written down all the answers you will need for a application. Some places will want you to complete the application on the spot. You should have addresses, employment dates, emergency contact information etc.\n- Ask your parents, a teacher or other adult you trust to look over your resume and to help you practice for interviews.\n\nRemember, job hunting is a job.

0,"Holy Numbers...? ; Are 11, 7, 9 and holy numbers? ; There is only one Holy Number Known as Divine Proportion or Phi\nPhi ( = 1.618033988749895... ), most often pronounced fi like ""fly,"" is simply an irrational number like pi ( p = 3.14159265358979... ), but one with many unusual mathematical properties.  Unlike pi, which is a transcendental number, phi is the solution to a quadratic equation.\nPhi is the basis for the Golden Section, Ratio or Mean\n\nThe ratio, or proportion, determined by Phi (1.618 ...) was known to the Greeks as the ""dividing a line in the extreme and mean ratio"" and to Renaissance artists as the ""Divine Proportion""  It is also called the Golden Section, Golden Ratio and the Golden Mean.\nCircle with a diameter of 1 and circumference of piPhi, like Pi, is a ratio defined by a geometric construction\n\nJust as pi (p) is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, phi () is simply the ratio of the line segments that result when a line is divided in one very special and unique way.\nDivide a line so that:\n\nSectioning a line to form the Golden Section\n\nthe ratio of the length of the entire line (A)\nto the length of larger line segment (B)\n\nis the same as\n\nthe ratio of the length of the larger line segment (B)\nto the length of the smaller line segment (C).\n \nThis happens only at the point where:\n\nA is 1.618 ... times B and B is 1.618 ... times C.\n\nAlternatively, C is 0.618... of B and B is 0.618... of A.\n\nPhi with an upper case ""P"" is 1.618 0339 887 ..., while phi with a lower case ""p"" is 0.6180339887, the reciprocal of Phi and also Phi minus 1.\n\nWhat makes phi even more unusual is that it can be derived in many ways and shows up in relationships throughout the universe.\nPhi can be derived through:\n\n    *      A numerical series discovered by Leonardo Fibonacci\n    *      Mathematics\n    *      Geometry\n\nPhi appears in:\n\n    *      The proportions of the human body\n    *      The proportions of many other animals\n    *      Plants\n    *      DNA\n    *      The solar system\n    *      Art and architecture\n    *      Music\n    *      Population growth\n    *      The stock market\n    *      The Bible and in theology\nPhi in the Bible: Although perhaps not immediately obvious, phi and the golden section also appear in the Bible.  Also see the Theology page.\nThe Ark of the Covenant is a Golden Rectangle\nIn Exodus 25:10, God commands Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant, in which to hold His Covenant with the Israelites, the Ten Commandments, saying,\n    ""Have them make a chest of acacia wood-\n    two and a half cubits long,\n    a cubit and a half wide,\n    and a cubit and a half high.""\n\nThe ratio of 2.5 to 1.5 is 1.666..., which is as close to phi (1.618 ...) as you can come with such simple numbers and is certainly not visibly different to the eye.  The Ark of the Covenant is thus constructed using the Golden Section, or Divine Proportion.  This ratio is also the same as 5 to 3, numbers from the Fibonacci series.\n\nNote:  A cubit is the measure of the forearm below the elbow.\nNoah's Ark uses a Golden Rectangle\n\nIn Genesis 6:15, God commands Noah to build an ark saying,\n    ""And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.""\n\nThus the end of the ark, at 50 by 30 cubits, is also in the ratio of 5 to 3, or 1.666..., again a close approximation of phi not visibly different to the naked eye.  Noah's ark was built in the same proportion as ten arks of the covenant placed side by side.\n\n\nNoah's Ark\nThe Number 666 is related to Phi\nThe relationship of phi and 666\nRevelation 13:18 says the following:\n    ""This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is a man's number. His number is 666.""\nThis beast, regarded by some as the Anti-Chri",5783

Certain series are more valuable than others.  I believe that the 1992 Gary Sheffield rookie card isn't that valuable because Don Russ is not a particularly good series and I believe that 1992 was not a particularly valuable year for rookie cards.

1,"What came first, the chicken or the egg? and why? ; must be the chicken ; In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.\n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.\n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.",5797

A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.  It would be cool to select an item and just start feeding in all those different currencies until the item is paid for, and it spits out change in Dollars or something.

How astronomer knows the light from a galaxy is 50 million years old? ; By the red shifts of the measurement. Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

Also, would you know of any other ways to raise your credit score? Thank you ; Snowball technique:\n\n1. Look at all old debts. Rank them from easiest to hardest to pay off based on total owed, minimum payment due, and (tiebreaker) highest interest rates.\n\n2. While making minimum payments to all other debts, pay this one, PLUS as much extra as you can swing- AT LEAST an extra 10%, but the more the better!\n\n3. As soon as this one is paid off, apply all of the payments you WERE making on it to the next debt in line, WHILE still paying the amount on it you were. By this time, you should be paying about twice the minimum so this one will go faster.\n\n4. Repeat for each other debt- the monthly payment will be getting bigger and bigger, paying it off faster and faster.\n\n5. Throw whatever 'windfalls' you can at this also- tax returns, bonuses, etc.\n\nThey say the snowball will get you debt free in the quickest amount of time- even faster than consolidation loans, etc. One nice thing about it is that YOU are in control of it.

4,"Why are Macs not as popular as other PCs? ; Whenever I tell people that I am looking to buy a Macintosh Computer, they always give me grief and tell me that I am making a poor decision. I actually like Macs better. I just wondered why they are not as popular. ; I think if you looked at the percentage of Mac users who are enthusiastic about their machines, as opposed to the percentage of Windows users who are enthusiastic about their machines, you'd see a big difference in 'popularity!'  (Can ya tell I'm a Mac addict?!)  :D\n\nAnyway, the real issue goes back much farther than the other answerers suggest:  Right from the start, Apple kept tighter control over its OS and hardware technology, which was not the case for the PC world.  As a result, anybody & their dog was out there putting together hardware & software for Windows, with the freedom to do things their own way inside.  Back then more so than now, that meant much more competition (& lower prices,) but also meant that there were lots of compatibility issues with 'tricked out' PC systems.  Different peripheral vendors would do their own thing, & when you put the wrong two parts in the same machine, they would freak out the whole system.  Mac users simply didn't have that problem.  (Every now & then something would crop up, but not NEARLY to the extent that it did for the PC world.)  Still, enough users were looking primarily at the up-front savings, and lots of people did a minimum of customization, anyway.  All that allowed MS-DOS (which evolved to Windows) to build up a larger base of customers, and that momentum built on itself.\n\nIn most ways, Windows has finally (mostly) caught up with Macs in stability & usability.  And, Macs aren't as much more expensive than PCs as they used to be, either.  But, you won't see me giving up my Macs!  :)\n\nYou are not making a poor decision!  Go for it!",6165
3,"I have a report on to kill a mokingbird (see below for details)? ; I have a report on Mrs. Dubose's characteristics in To Kill a Mockingbird. Can someone give me all the traits and details? It is due tommorow \n\nPLEASE HELP ; summary:\n\nScout (Jean Louise) Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama county of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris (Dill), who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside in daylight.\n\nScout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ black cook, takes them to the local black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAtticus’s sister, Alexandria, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem, Dill, and Scout, who snuck out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death (though it might be that he tried to escape so he could get shot deliberately because he wanted to die looking like a hero. However, in the book, it is said that he could've escaped if he had two good arms instead of one). In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a halloween pageant at their school. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children. Atticus at first believes that Jem fatally stabbed Mr. Ewell in the struggle. ",6166

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

My husband on the other hand has a son and the mother took him and moved away because he didn't want to be with her.My husband has ALWAYS taken care of his son.He gave her money voluntarily and still paid for stuff on the side for him. Now she filed child support and has been awarded $400 a month for one child! how rediculous is that. If child support is suppose to be fair then they are telling us it takes $800 a month to take care of this child? Thats BS! Unless your childhas special needs or is ill it does not take even 400 a month to take care of one child. She has no rent cause she lives with her dad and my husband paid for both cars she has. Why do they have these men solely paying for these kids? What is the mothers responsibility? What does she pay for? ; child support is not a magical number that the judge pulls out of his butt.  child support is based on the income of the mother, the income of the father etc.  the state has a chart and depending on what the father makes a figure is computed. in other words x+y=z.  unfortunately i see alot of cases come through my court where the father is the one 99% of the time paying child support.  and even worse the state does not factor in if the father has a mortgage, utilities, food expenses etc.  it sucks big!  i get so angry sometimes in court, but we have to maintain our proffessionalism.  and as soon as these women find out that the father has obtained a second job, they petition the court for more money because he has more income.  I had a case last week that was just absolutely insane.  the man was a capt. in the army and he was ordered to pay alimony, child support, and maintain the mortgage on the house that she got during the divorce and he no longer resides in.  in the end with all the money he was paying out to her, she ended up receiving more of his income than he did.  I have even had many men blatently tell the judge that they would rather go to jail than to pay.  I think in regards to reaching what amount he or she should pay, the state should take into considering what he/she pays out in living expenses and then factor child support. unfortunately the state feels that if you have to live under a bridge they don't care as long as they pay.  you can always repetition the court and present your case and see if they will lower his support amount.",6256

The CBP officer at the port of arrival can ""just say no"" and back on the plane the visitor goes without recourse.  Also a VWP does not allow adjustment of status.  For example, you two find true love and get married, too bad, back he goes!\n\nIf he came in under a B1/B2 (or other visas) or even as an Entry Without Inspection EWI (pronounced Eee Wee) he can adjust status in some circumstances.\n\nIf he works at all, even for tips at a diner, he is ""out of status"" and is the easiest illegal to process.  [catching VWP violators are the most fun.  The paperwork is minimal and language is not usually a problem!]\n\nMillions of people would love to find work here and stay.\n\nTo you and any other US citizen considering marriage to an alien.\n\nIt amazes me how many divorces occur once the alien gets the ""lawful permanent resident"" (pronounced ""Lapper"") or green card.\n\nAlso a LPR who gets arrested can be deported back home.  So ask yourself two questions:\n\nDoes the alien REALLY love you or are they just wanting a green card?\n\nand\n\nDo you love the alien enough to move to their country permanently?\n\n\nHonest answers to these questions can save heartache (and child abductions) later.",6274

Did you know that if a 16 year old girl corners a guy over 18 and touches him, even thru the clothes and without his consent, he could be the one to get arrested? And nothing happens to her. \nBut here in Florida, all these people are put on the SAME Sex Offender list and when the public look it up, they ""believe"" everyone on the list molested a young child.

6,"Can my apartment complex force me to purchase renters insurance? ; My apartment has sent around a memo saying that at the renewal of my lease, I will have to purchase renters insurance or be evicted.  Everyone in the complex is being sent this memo.  Is this legal? ; The key is that they are not requiring it before lease renewal. It will be a condition of staying.   They can pretty much condition the lease on anything they can find enough renters to agree to. \n\nNow, renters insurance isn't terribly expensive, and has benefits to you and the landlord.  I suspect it's going to cost you about $15 per month, get a quote somewhere.  Look at it as if it were a rent increase, and make your decision whether to accept it or not. \n\nWhat renters insurance does for them is protect against damage done to their place by your pets, or a fire you cause, some other things.  What it does for you is protect you if a guest of yours is injured on your property, cover your belongings if there's a fire or burglary, some other things.  \n\nThey sell renters insurance to a lot of people that aren't required to have it by their lease.  You should get a rate quote and find out what good it does for you.  It's not necessarily a bad idea.",6284

9,"What causes people to commit a crime? ; I'm wanting to know because i have to do a speech for school on crime rates and i was just wondering why a person would commit a crime. Any sort of crime in my books is wrong no matter what your reason is. ; It can be a combination of things, and in most real cases it is.  Poverty, upbringing, financial status, social status, can all have a push or pull when some one is deciding on commiting a crime.  In most crimes most people have a well structured plan of what they were going to do, which means that it wasn't some spur of the moment thing.  For example I did a case studie on Drug related crimes: selling, production and so forth.  Over 40 percent of the criminals admited that it was easier for them to sell and produce drugs than it was to actually go and get a paying job.  Now that can be considerd a social upbringin or classification.  \n\nFor some people crime is a way of life, Little Rock Arkansas has the highest rate of gang killings in the US Higher than LA, Okland, and New York.  There was a documentary that showed that little kids were raised up in gangs, hanging round drugs, sex, and crime.  It wasn't a case of these children choosing to joing the Crypts of the Bloods it was that they were raised in the enviorment.  Additionaly to the gang enviorment these children were raised in poverty, the social sturcture was messed up from the beginning weather it was parenting, education, and so on.  \n\nThen you have those that do it for the thrill of doing it.  Take for example kids killing for fun.  I forgot what show it was (was on A&E) but was over kids killing other kids for fun. 4 out of the 5 killers that were intervied said they wanted to know what it felt like to kill.

I need a free full antivirus or antispyware because i am infested with the Trojan virus i scanned the computer with the NOD32,Adware-SE and Spyware Blaster but no succes.When i start the windos explorer i dont see my default page, i see a website safety security or something like that and he told me that i have a virus and i have files exposed on the internet such as System32,Program files and other files.They said that i need some update or patch but it doesnt work yesterday i tried to download the update but it says that Page cannot be displayed. what should i do i need to get this virus out of my computer but how? ; First of all, one of the easiest wey to stop online attacks is, STOP USING INTERNET EXPLORER. Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

5,"why don't rugby players sustain injuries like footballers.? ; In the world cup the game is stopped every ten minutes due to somebody rolling around in agony on the ground,but in Rugby, \nplayers have broken noses and teeth missing but rarely do you see a match stopped. ; Football by the very nature of the game concentrates mainly on the feet - with the speed and standard of football increased the tackles and contact to the lower part of the body will be quite hard & frequent. With rugby on the other hand most of the contact will be experienced in the upper body - the training builds up the upper body to take the hits. Probably since there is more 'flesh' (muscle & bulk) on the upper body the degree & frequency of contact that can be sustained would be greater than around the ankles & shins. \nThe rolling around bit by the footbal players is probably due to the fact that in todays football/soccer games it is that hard to score a goal due to the high level of skill, any advantage gained will be a bonus.\nWith rugby union now being a fully professional sport, increased speed & fitness combined with the large number of games being played I think injuries will be more common place. What you will notice is that due to the reasons just mentioned before, the retirement age of the rugby players will decrease, remember Paul Rendel 'The Judge' played international rugby for England in the 1980's at the age of 36 - it will be unlikely that players will represent their country at an international level at such an age in future.",6526

Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.

5,"Deer sheds? ; Why do deer shed their antlers, and why is it at only a certain time frame of the year? ; Why do deer shed their antlers?\nDeer shed their antlers annually as a prelude to the regeneration, or re-growth, of new ones.\n\nThe entire shedding process takes a mere two to three weeks to complete, and the re-growth phase takes place over the summer. The docile male deer that, with the exception of the male and the female reindeer, solely sports antlers, sheds them between January and April, after the autumn mating season draws to a close. He can do without antlers at this time, because his need for them in prior months, to attract and to impress females for his harem of mates, and to fight with his competitors for the females' affections, no longer exists.\n\nThe antlers themselves differ from the hollow horns of cattle, in that they comprise solid bone tissue with a honey combed structure. Pedicles, or knobby, skin-covered nubs protruding from the skull, support the deer's antlers, or points, which range in number from one shaft to eleven branches. The pedicles are a permanent fixture on the deer's forehead, and are the point from which the antlers annually break off.\n\nDuring the first year the pedicles appear on the young deer's forehead. The following year, the youngster sprouts straight, spike- like shafts, and in the third year, the first branch appears. In successive years, as the deer matures, his antlers lengthen and, in most species, he acquires additional branches. One can actually determine the age of the deer from the number of branches on his antlers, as their number increases with age.\n\n During the growth phase of the bony antlers, they are covered with a sensitive skin referred to as ""velvet,"" which is filled with blood vessels that feed the antlers the vitamins and the minerals necessary to build up the bone, and to promote normal antler growth. Antler growth spans two to four months, after which time the velvet is no longer needed, and a ring, which effectively serves as a shutoff valve, forms at the base of the antlers and cuts off the blood supply to the velvet. As a result, the velvet withers, dries up, and falls off, often assisted by the deer, which rubs his antlers against tree bark. The antler regeneration is complete, and the shedding cycle will resume once mating season in the fall concludes.",6629

Can they do this ; If the boy is under age and the father is a registered sex offender, he could be, based on the law where the boy is located.  Also, if his parole states that he must stay away from children, the answer is a definite yes, if the boy is underage.\n\nAnother issue is in the boy's mother got a restraining order against the father for herself or the boy or it is part of the divorce decree that he stay away from the mother or the boy.  If either is true, the answer is again, a definite yes.\n\nAs the boy is an adult, does the boy have a restraining order against the father?

0,"Bored = Afraid of Hindus or Buddhists? ; I dont fear any people of faith.  Spirituality, like someone said is entirely different.  Spiritual people's beliefs, from what ive encountered, are overwhelmingly positive and personal, as opposed to half positive, sometimes disgustingly negative.  Buddhists i think have far more sensible and positive beliefs than christians, i think eastern 'religions' are intriguing and to be learned from.  I cant say that i dont like all christians, i dont know them all, i dont like what they believe.  Dont pray for me, instead smoke a blunt for me, at least do something that accomplishes something.  If anyone cares, my belief system is very simple;  if there is a god, he will not punish me or anyone else for that matter in any way.  Beyond that big IF, i believe that i dont know, and i wont pretend to.  But i will constantly question, and never accept blindly the assertions of people who know just as little as i do.  Religion WISHES to impose its VERY conservative positions into everyones life. ; For thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry. God is not like a father in a patriarchal society, who has His favorite children to whom He communicates. This idea seems rather archaic and crude. Hinduism believes in behavior than belief and  experience over authority. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, Prophetic religion is severe, militant, uncompromising, intolerant, while mystic religions are renouncing, and peaceful. \n\nThere is no need to be afraid of world's most tolerant, religion wich never persecuted nor attcked any country in name of religion .\n\nBored?? The vast collection of Hidu philosophy is fascinating and colourfull. No one can ever be bored . \n\nIn fact it will improve your understanding of mysticism even in christianity.It is a collection of wisdom of innemerable sages are missing out a great deal.\n\nThe Hindu religious system can be divided into two major systems. The Orthodox system (called astika in Sanskrit) accepts the authority of the Vedas.\n\n1. Sankhya - founder Sage Kapila\n2. Yoga  -  Sage Patanjali\n3. Mimamsa  - Sage Vyasa / Sage Jaimini\n4. Vedanta  - Shankaracharya, Ramanuja/Chaitanya/ Madhava/Vallabha\n5. Nyaya  - Sage Gautama (not Buddha)\n6. Vaisheshika - Sage Kanda\n\nThe Heterdox (Nastika) system rejects the authority of the Vedas. This system includes Carvaka (materialism), Jainism, and Buddhism. The Carvaka system denies existence of the individual self(atman) apart from the body and rejects the notion of moksha (salvation) for the atman\n\nWisdom of Geeta is a class apart.\n\nHinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of worship. When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. For it is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. Thus, it becomes a kind of social idolatry. Highly individualistic, Hindus have always resisted any regimentation of thought.\n\nRegarding mothermulesmeals' post:\n\n I am glad I am not one of her friends at whom she is  always preaching Jesus  !!!

Banks have a soft-spot for their customers and that can be a positive factor in their credit approval.\n\nNext, look at cards offered by Chase, CapitalOne or Citibank.  These are reputable company.\n\nOrchard Bank should never be a choice if you're building credit. In my opinion, their lending practices border on predatory. Fees are outrageous, and they are not very good at disclosing hidden ones.\n\nIf your credit is as bad as your say, be prepared.  \n    You may be denied.   \n    You may be offered a secured credit card.\n    You may be offered a credit card with a higher rate.  \n\nIf you're denied for credit, don't keep trying. Wait for at least 6 months before you try again. When you apply for a credit card, the lender will get your credit report. The more you apply for credit, the lower your score can get and less like you are to be approved for credit.\n\nVicious cycle, right?\n\nIf the credit card has a high APR, consider accepting the card.  The high APR will only affect you if you carry a balance at the end of each statement cycle.  BUT pay off everything when the bill comes. \n\nIf you do this, you won't see your credit improve right away.  It may takes anywhere from 1-7 years to repair your credit.\n\nIf you were offered a secured credit card, think twice. Lenders don't just look at your credit score or whether you have a good repayment history. They also look at the type of credit lines you have.",6702

3,"Why don't teachers know how to handle special needs children? ; I have two grandsons that are Featial Alochol Exposed/Featial Alochol Syndrom and the teachers can't seem to teach them anything. Do you have any suggestions that I could pass along? The boys are only five and six. ; Try taking the advice given here. Be prepared to march down to the school a lot to try to get this taken care of. Your grandkids CAN learn! Then, if none of that works, consider homeschooling, or have the parents consider homeschooling, whichever is more appropriate. Like some of these teachers said, they are trained to educate regular student, not special children. I know a boy with FAS and a myriad of other diagnoses, and when he was eight years old, he snuck out of a locked campus and was halfway home before his grandma was called and told he was missing. He had walked about five miles. Homeschooling gives you the advantage of knowing your grandson's individual problems. There are so many different types of problems going on in a special ed class, that I don't blame the teacher for being overwhelmed. Most special ed kids excel once they start being taught at home because they are in an environment they know, with loving caregivers who understand the complexities of their own disorders, and are able to work at their own pace. There's no distractions like there are in a classroom. It just seems to work. There are several place you can turn to to learn about homeschooling kids with special needs. Check yahoo groups, there's a lot. I'm on HS-Plus, and it's a really good group. Lots of different disorders being dealt with, FAE/FAS is a big one, so you'd get lots of help. I homeschool my autistic pre-schooler, and will be homeschooling my 'normal' little one, and any others that come along.

2,"Does anybody know about possible drug interactions between Bubropion and cocaine? ; I am starting to take Wellbutrin tomarrow but I am concerned that my recent cocaine use (this morning) will cause an adverse reaction or interaction. Has anybody any knowledge in this area? ; This is from Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders - 3rd ed. (2001):   \n\nBupropion, a ""second generation"" antidepressant, has also been examined for a possible role in cocaine pharmacotherapy. In an open pilot study, treatment with bupropion reduced cocaine use (Margolin et al. 1991) and attenuated several cocaine-induced positive subjective ratings during laboratory cocaine administration (Singha et al. 1997). However, a multisite placebo-controlled study failed to show that bupropion was more efficacious than placebo in reducing cocaine's effects (Margolin et al. 1995b). \n\nBasically, it's saying that Wellbutrin has been administered along with cocaine, but it's not clear that it actually helps with cocaine addiction.  It sounds like you're okay to take it, but if you don't usually use cocaine, why not wait a day before starting the bupropion, just to be sure?",6747

1,"Did time begin with the so called ""Big Bang"",  or did the Big Bang occur at some point in time? ; I'm just facinated with the concept of time especially it's beginning and end.  Do you think time can be thought of in terms of a straight line or is it a circle.  No beginning and no end. ; By definition, the big-bang is the beginning of the known universe; that is to say: everything that can be known is from after the big-bang. And so, implicitly your question is answered – time started with the big-bang, simply because we can not find any proof of it’s existence before. (I know, it is a little confusing.)\n\nAs to time’s linearity –\nI’ll start with a different difficult concept – infinity. \nDraw a square grid. Stretch it to infinity. ALL of its edges are now at infinity. In any direction you choose to move, you will eventually reach infinity. The same word describes your location no matter where you are. If all these places are denoted by one word-symbol-number, than all these places are one!\nGauss was first to visualize this: take your infinite grid and wrap it around a sphere with a radius of one that rests at its origin. The point (0,0) would become a southern pole, the point we called infinity would become the northern pole. \nAny infinite straight line would become a circle when drawn on this sphere grid. \n\nNow I’ll give you back your question: what do you think is the shape of the time line?",6764

Exercising WHILE you have the cramps only makes them worse-- trust me, I had that problem when I was 18 (at first the doc thought it might be a cyst, but then I just started working out all the time because of a school activity, and I am 21 now, still work out regularly, haven't had them since).  And you said cheaply-- exercise is free!\n\nBut speaking of cysts, it could be one of those.  My friend's sister had killer cramps, and it turned out that a cyst was the reason.

5,"What is the top scuba gear for 2005 for the following items...? ; Mask\nFins\nTorch\nWetsuit\nRegulator\nOther gadgets worth mentioning? ; A mask is all about the fit.  A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.  My preference is the Apollo bio fins although there are many excellent choices out there.\n\nIn terms of torch, I think that depends on your application.  I like the Ikelite PCA, the UK SL4 and the small UK pocket light.  These would work for tropical night diving.  Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.  I really like the scubapros but there are *many* great choices.  Rodale's Scuba Diving does do periodic gear reviews that are worth a look.\n\nWetsuit is alll about two things:  a) correct thickness for the water temp and your cold tolerance; and b) fit.\n\nWhat about a bc?",6770

If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time. Of all of these Stephen Hawking's were the easiest for me to understand and the most interesting to read.  You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.  The visible phases of the moon would still have nothing to do with the affect on time however.  \n\nThat was an interesting question, I hope my answer was of some use to you!\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus\n*thanks for correcting me on the orbital change Answer Guy.",6806

6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds. Also, be sure to balance this investment with some equity (stock) investments to give you diversification. Good luck!",6852
3,"Ethics Question? ; A highly valued employee recently told you that she borrowed money from the petty cash fund during the past year and wrote false receipts.

Do you dismiss her?\n\nI would really be interested in anyone who doesn't not believe that she should be fired and their logic as to why. ; I don't believe she should be fired, after all the funds came from the ""petty"" cash fund; and in the absence of an explanation for these incidences I would suggest that she must have had a compelling reason or a mental condition to engage in this aberrant behavior. The stated fact that she is a highly valued employee would suggest that salvaging her is the direction to take, sometimes forgiveness can be applied in the secular world and people who are afforded second chances often go on to become role models. The fact that she has confessed should also be considered in this argument, as this can be deemed as remorse for these actions and remorse is generally an indication that the offence will not be committed again. Perhaps this employee should be transferred to a department that will allow her to perform her duties without the temptation of money to corrupt her, as a way that this dilemma can be best resolved without her being fired or involving the authorities.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions?? ; A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.  This is one entity or energy.  \n\nThe paths we as humans choose to find this source is our differing religions each with their merits and flaws.  We seek the same source.  Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God. The ultimate source.\n\nHumans are different in their perceptions of everything so it is reasonable that God would have conceived of different paths to reach the One, ie enlightenment.",6898

Help, plz (& the prom is just around the corner...although I'm not sure if I'm going)!!!!!! ; There are none--side effects can be worse than the pill itself.  Learn to change your lifestyle and you'll be happier in the end and will end up not gaining the weight back from Drastic dieting or pills.  Once you start eating better and doing something for exercise the weight will come off --those that have more to lose will see a results faster than those that have only 5-10 lbs to lose.  For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.  No sugar, white bread, rice, fast food, processed foods, etc.  Spread them out between 6 meals a day, every 2.5 hours, this means every meal will have to be 430 calories, not bad when you break it up.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026

My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.

The gK2Cr2O7 cancel, leaving molK2Cr2O7. Multiply by 1000mLK2Cr2O7/0.5molK2Cr2O7. This comes from 0.5M, which means 0.5 mol in 1000mL.

The kids were tested and came back positive and were taken away. She says that she was told that she was legally responsible for him now. They've been together for approx 10 yrs but are not married. Is this true? I don't believe it is. ; Whether it is true depends on exactly what she was actually told.\nIf she had just posted bail/bond for the guy; then yes, she is legally responsible for him until his court date. That's the same for anyone putting up an appearance bond: you are legally responsible for the person showing up to court.\nIf they told her she could be legally responsible for him cooking in the house; that's a little gray. If she had any prior knowledge at all, she could be held legally responsible for not removing the children from the danger he posed by using the house for a meth lab.\nNow, there is a secondary element at work here. You said they were living together for about ten years. Depending on their conduct, and the laws regarding it in IA, the argument could be made that they actually *are* married, at least by common law; which would open her up to more liability.",7151

Those on death row have hurt innocent people, families, children and society. What acts has an unborn child committed to deserve the fate of being aborted. \n\nThis is a perfect example of how liberals are on the wrong side of issues. Liberals will claim that abortion is a right to privacy issue - the so called, ""it is my body and I can do with it what I wish"". Well- a person cannot do whatever they wish with their body if it effects me. You cannot take your fist (which is part of your body) and punch me in the face. A person has the right to privacy in their home, but that does not extend to activities which are illegal. Your rights end where my rights begin. A heart beats at less than 4 weeks. Isn't a heart beat the final determinat ; I know you don't actually want an answer - you seem more interested in pontificating.  Be that as it may, it is perfectly easy to justify a belief in the legality of abortion vs. the legality of the death penalty.  For me, capital punishment is a governmental rights issue - that is, I do not believe the government has the right to deprive its citizens of life under any circumstances.  It's simply something the government should not be allowed to do, because allowing it for some people (odious though they may be) makes it easier to apply it for lesser crimes - a slippery slope argument, essentially.\n\nAbortion is a different issue, because (1) it is not the government depriving someone of life; (2) there's no scientific reason to argue that life begins at conception; and (3) if we assume life begins at conception, then all laws regarding children would apply to zygotes/fetuses, which would be unworkable in any society.",7165

These chordates have the primitive support structure, a dorsal notochord. \nAdult Tunicates lack notochords, except for the planktoninc and tiny Appendiculaceans.  Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse.

3,"Spelling, grammer etc? ; Yeah I pretty much suck at all the spelling, grammer kinda of stuf, so can you guys help me out? I wrote this on copper:\n\nCopper comes from the Latin word cuprum. It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

1,"a math question? ; You are a manufacturer of steel containers(for liquids) of two basic shapes- tins shaped as right circular cylinders and rectangular boxes. The containers' capacity is 1 litre. Obviously you want to use the least amount of steel so as to maximise your profits. Can you work out the dimensions of the containers? How many different boxes of the same type will you have? And if possible, illustrate your response with graphs and tables, well-documented. ; Since one litre = 1000cm^3,   We can construct a cylindrical container with surface area S = 2pir^2 +2pirh.(I am using pi since I don' t have the greek symbol.)  We wish to minimize S subject to the constraint that V = pir^2h = 1.  Now, rewrite the equation for S as S = 2pir^2 + 2pir(1/pir^2) = 2pir^2 + 2/r).

2,"My husband was told his hep c has gone away, Is that possible? ; This came from our family dr. He was first diagnosed three years ago. ; When people are diagnosed with Hep C, the doctor will order a VIRAL LOAD which reports exactly how much of the virus exists in the body.  A high viral load means that the person has more of the virus in their system.  Conversely, if someone has a low viral load, they have a low amount of the virus in their system...\nI am assuming your husband went through the Intereferon treatments to interefere with the progression of the virus.  If this is the case....\nObviously you know that throughout treatment your husband went in for periodic blood tests.  The doctor was checking his viral load which tells how well the treatment is working.  As long as your husband's viral load was decreasing, it means the treatment was effective.  There becomes a point where the Hep C viral load becomes indetectable.... meaning the viral load is basically 0.  This doesn't mean that it is cured, as your husband will always run the risk of having the virus become active again, but at this point he has no detectable Hep Viral particles in his system.  So for all intents and purposes, he is cured.  At this point he is less contageous than before.  Technically if he has no virus in his system, he cannot pass it along.  \nI hope this informations helps and good luck to you and your husband in the future!!!!  Congrats!",7311

8,"Guys-- why is the idea of having sex with two girls pleasurable? ; My BF told me before he could have sex with two girls- one of them being me of course.  But I cannot stand the thought of watching him having sex with another girl. This bothers me especially after vowing with each other we wouldn't have sex with other people.  Is this a product of his porn watching and wanting to experience new things? I think I give him plenty of sex and good sex too. I don't understand... ; Ok, I have to say that a lot of the answers that you have received so far are close, but none of them quite hit the mark or cover all the bases, so I am going to see what I can do here. \n First of all, I am fairly qualified here as my fiancé and I have done a threesome with both another woman and another guy, and our relationship has survived it unscathed. \n To answer the main question of why. . . There is no single answer that would apply to all men that have those desires. Yes, porn for a lot of us has glorified the threesome. Another common reason is that watching two women be intimate is quite erotic. Lets face it, they call you the ""fairer sex"" for a reason!!\n Could your BF feel pressure to please you? If so, a second person could be viewed as a helper.\n The most common reason, however, is simply the desire to have variety in ones sex life.\n Now, let's address how you should go forward. First of all, your BF shared a fantasy with you, and if you ever want him to ever do so again, you cannot react negatively to it. That does not mean that you have to do it, but you also want to avoid him feeling rejection from it.\n To help you decide if having a threesome with another woman is something you want to do, consider this:\n Are you physically attracted to women? I.E. Are you bi/bi-curious? If so, you could decide that you are will have a threesome with him with the stipulation that he and the other woman do not have sex. Set very specific boundaries, I.E. Is touching ok? Is kissing ok? Is manual stimulation ok? Etc. . . If you cannot trust him to abide by these boundaries during the heat of the moment, you do NOT want to do this!\n If you decide that you do not want to do this, explain it to him, but offer to incorporate it into your fantasy life. Say something to him like ""The idea turns me on, but I would not be ok with the reality of it"", and then bring it up in a sexy way during foreplay or lovemaking. Reiterate after you are done having sex that this is something that can only be a fantasy, never a reality. This is often the perfect compromise in these situations.\n In my experience, a man bringing this fantasy to his significant other is generally sign of developing trust, and not of impending doom. The act itself, however, has been the end of many strong relationships, so tread carefully!!",7395

8,"Really can't stand my brother's fiancee...? ; On the surface my brother's fiancee is a good person. You know, she does all the socially right things (like immediate thank you notes, volunteering to cook on family holidays, sending flowers when people have had a rough week- that type of stuff). But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could. I dont know ive never really been in that situation but i can see it going bad easily if its not delt with care :) I hope that helps",7400

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

1,"Could you please compare the actions of the hormones Prolactin and Oxytocin? ; Also, please state the glands secreting them. ; After birth, the mother's estrogen and progesterone levels decrease thus causing the anterior pituatary to produce prolactin.  Prolactin gets the breast ready to secrete milk.  During lactation prolactin also synthesizes the milk.  Prolactin production is stimulated by the infant suckling.  \nOxytocin is also a hormone that plays a role in lactation.  Just as prolactin is stimulated by infant suckling, so is oxytocin.  As the infant suckles, the posterior pituary is triggered to produce oxytocin.  Oxytocin is responsible for the milk ejection reflex.  This reflex is accomplished by oxytocin stimulating the myoepithelial cell around the nipple and allowing the milk to be expressed through the ducts and out the nipple.",7511

2,"what can a person take to control cough? ; Without taking a perscription drug. ; HI BARB\n\nHere is the cause and a remedy for you.\n\nCause \nThis is often caused by a stomach disorder that comes from overloading the system with food, wherein fermentation in the stomach causes phlegm. It may also be induced by inflammation in the bronchial tubes due to a neglected cold. Worms may be the cause. Many coughs are from a nervous condition, where coughing may eventually become habitual. Coughs are highly misunderstood. Usually a sore throat and coughing are caused by the sinuses draining the eustachian tubes, which is like pouring acid down the throat. A cough usually comes from a lowered vitality in the system from improper diet, loss of sleep, lack of exercise, and fresh air, improper breathing, poor elimination, or improper night clothing and bedding. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1. Acute coughs can often be relieved with a little honey and onion syrup. When it is the result of an old acute condition, clear out the morbid condition as rapidly as possible without causing irritation. In old cough conditions, comfrey with vervain or mullein are very good. The antispasmodic tincture is also excellent, and it is good to massage the chest area across the back with an antispasmodic tincture during attacks of spasms. Antispasmodic tincture may be used both internally and externally as a liniment on the throat. If this is due to a neglected cold, any of the diaphoretic herbs are excellent. To relieve the coughing spasms, use horehounds, comfrey, or a small amount of lobelia. High enemas of herbal laxatives will relieve congestion of the bowels, and if the cough is severe (asthma, whooping cough) load the stomach with liquids and induce vomiting. \n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers",7531

4,"what is DD-RAM? ; answer my question plz... ; I dont know if You mean DVD-RAM\n\nA dvd is a digital video/versatile disk and RAM is Random Access Memory.\nThe DVD-RAM format is based on PD-RW (Phase-Differential) drives, and actually uses a cartridge to hold the media (just like its PD-RW predecessor). Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are). The Plextor PX-504U is an example of an external DVD+R/+RW drive capable of recording single layer discs in the +R/+RW format, but also able to read discs recorded by a DVD-R drive.",7559
4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

Find the hegiht of the smaller building and the horizontal distance between the two buildings. ; Trigonometry is hard to do in you head, so start out by making a drawing. You have two buildings A (tall) and B (short) - Draw them far apart, not like this:\n\nA         B\n|         \n|         \n|    \n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n\nNow draw one line from the top of A to the top of B - this is the angle of depression of the top and it is 46 degrees. That is, if you drew a straight, horizontal line across the top of building A, the angle between that line and the line joining the top of A to the top of B is 46 degress.\n\nSimilarly, draw a line from the top of A to the *bottom* of B - this is the angle of depression of the bottom and it is 77 degrees. That is, the angle between the horizontal line across the top of A, and the line between top of A and bottom of B is 77 degrees.\n\nNow can you find out the angle between the line from A-top to B-top, and the line from A-top to B-bottom? (It's very important for you to draw this!) Let's put this value aside for a minute. \n\nLooking at your drawing, can you see that you know the value for *part* of the angle between the horizontal line across A's top and length of building A? What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom. Solve this triangle for line A-bottom to B-bottom for distance between the two buildings.\nTriangle 2: A-top to B-top to B-bottom. Solve this triangle for line B-top to B-bottom for height of building. \n\nDon't forget, we have two important angles that will help solve these two triangles!",7575
6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business. Treat your loyal customers well and they will return to you every morning and will start bringing in their friends. Give customers a few low cost freebies and taste tests. They will definitely remember your generosity. \n\nI hope that helps a bit!\n\n~Mark Lim\n\nhttp://www.poisonappleshirts.com",7576

1,"Do you know how stones are cut? Also, how did the ancient Egyptians cut the stone and place it in the pyramids ; How did the Ancient Egyptians place the cut stones into the Great Pyramid? I wonder, so please help me answer this question. It is for a research paper, due on Mon. 1/23/06!!!!!!!!! ; the stone may have been cut with a chisel.  the stones may have been placed by workers moving them up ramps and into position.  it is hard to imagine either of these possibilities, but they are the best explanations that i have read.  chiselling such large blocks(i've read as much as 200 tons) and pushing them up a ramp seems unlikely, because even if u had the stones on site(which they probably didn't), building a ramp that could support that much weight, and to that height, would be just as difficult a building the pyramid in the first place.  it's also hard to understand how they had so much time to work on pyramids, when they should have been fishing and farming.  unless you think aliens or magic was involved the best answer is ""with lots of hard work"" and maybe more importantly a long time.",7622

1,"How to solve the Three-Jugs Problem mathematically (Very Complicated!!)? ; Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of water wish to share it evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

9,"what is the difference between peace and war and which one is better? ; so if you're answer is peace is better than war why the people also choose the war and why they broke the peace why they all takecare about the war hate died and all bad thing why they don't wanna to take carre about the gift of the GOD peace live and love ; Unfortunately War is a necessary evil. It sucks, and no one wants to go through it. Well let me re-phrase that, normal people don't want to go through it. But that is why it is at times necessary, not everyone is normal. Occasionally you get a bad guy or group who wants to dominate people by fear and torture. These are not reasonable people, and therefore are not reasoned with by peace or the nicer ways to negotiate, they see peace as a weakness, and try to use it as a way to overcome the peaceful. Anyone who thinks peace is the only way is right (in a perfect world). We don't live in a perfect world so at times war is the only way to get rid of the bad people. Yes war also means death to innocent people and harm and danger to the good forces who fight for the pure cause. Well it is either that or everyone around the world die and suffer under tyrannical groups/rule. The US and Allied military forces understand this concept now more than ever, and they are willing to put their lives on the line to fight for the citizen's of the World freedoms and liberties, which is the desired result of the War on Terror (which does include Iraq, whether anyone wants to admit it, the past regime was a regime which supported and committed terrorist activities on it's own people and the rest of the world).

1,"why is momentum important in physics? ; I personally don't think that momentum is particularly important, but if so, why is it important in physics? ; Momentum is the direct result of the following Newtonian Law of Inertia\nAny object in motion remains in motion and any object at rest remains at rest (unless a net force acts upon the object)\nMomentum (p) is the mass (m) of the object times its velocity (v).\np = mv\n\nForce (F) and Newtons Second Law can be derive from a change in momentum.  That is (t is time)\nF = delta p/delta t \nF = delta (m*v) / dt\nwe usually say m is constant so\nF = m * v/dt\nF =  ma    (a is acceleration or a change in v/time)\n\nNewtons third law is also based on momentum.  ""For every action there is an equal, yet opposite, reaction.""\n\nSo...  When a gun is fired what we see is the bullet propelled forward and the gun (and gun holder) propelled back.  Both received the same Force but because the gun and person holding it are much more massive than the bullet, the bullet will travel much faster. \ne.g F1 is the force on the bullet which is the same as the force on the person F2\nF1 = F2\ndelta p1/dt = delta p2/dt\nm1v1/dt = m2v2/dt\nm1v1 =m2v2\nImagine the bullet is 1 gram and a 180 lbs (~8182 grams) person shot the bullet...

I am working on a DE. \nThank you. ; here by simple trial u can see that x=1 satisfies the equation so be sure x=1 is indeed a factor. \nnow when we know that x=1 is factor it means (x-1)=0 devides it compleately. now we can decide other values of x easily. here is a technique which i think will be helpfull:\nrewrite x^3+x^2-2 as (x^3 - x^2) + (2(x^2)-2x) + (2x-2)\nnow it is simple to take (x-1) common from all the terms\nie.\n(x-1)(x^2+2x+2)\n\n# this technique is very useful once u master the techniq \n\nfor more mail me at sush_smvdu@yahoo.co.in,7783

CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc ; Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode.",7790

5,"when was the first time someone used a snowboard and what country or if in usa what state.? ; please answer this correctly it for a school assiment. ; Did you know that the first of the snowboards goes back all the way to 1929? Back then they has skis, but the first person to come up with the idea of a snowboard was a man named M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett. He cut out a plank of plywood and tried to stick his feet to the wood with the help of some clothes and horse reins. It was over 30 years after Burchett that the next step was taken towards the evolution of snowboards. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a chemical gases engineer in Muskegon invented the “The Snurfer”. The name was given by his wife. He came up with the “The Snurfer” in order to entertain his daughter. He made the Snurfer by putting two skis together and putting a rope at the nose so that the rider could hold it and keep it stable. Many of his friends were interested in this Snurfer and that inspired him into licensing his idea to a manufacturer. The Snurfer sold over half a million in 1966 but was only seen as a toy for kids, not something serious enough for adult entertainment. Poppen organized competitions in order to make the Snurfer even more poppular. Jake Burton was really into the Snurfer and participated in the competitions organized by Poppen. Since Burton’s parents wouldn’t buy him a board and let him surf, he amused himself with the Snurfer. He was also very into skiing alongside the Snurfer, but he broke his collarbone in a car accident and couldn’t participate in ski competitions anymore. Meanwhile, a college student, &#92;Dimitrije Milovich started making snowboards in 1969. He came up with the idea after sliding down with a cafeteria plate in College. He started his own company in 1972 with the name “Winterstick”. He got reviewed on Newsweek and Playboy, which increased the popularity of snowboards. Although he left the business in 1980, he is still recognised as one of the most important pioneers in developing snowboards. In 1977, Burton, after graduating from NYU moved to Vermont and started producing new versions of the Snurfer which he still remembered from childhood. He came up with the first binding and he amazed people when he won the Snurfer competition with his very own board with the bindings on it.",7967

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

Unfortunately, there are police officers in Texas who are now going INSIDE bars to breathalyze people and giving public intoxication tickets, even if they did not drive to the bar, and are not driving home. Fortunately, the vast majority of cops will not give a ticket someone riding in a car drunk, if the driver is sober. Usually this will only happen if the intoxicated person is belligerent or aggressive, and disrupting the safety and process of the traffic stop.\nAlso, if the passenger is underage, ANY trace of alcohol will result in at least a ticket for minor consumption.

1,"Explain theory of relativity.? ; please explain it in simplest language.\n\nalso is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nif it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets in it!! ; There are plenty of good websites that answer this question, for any knowledge level. The concept is complex enough that you won’t get a meaningful answer here.\n\nIn horribly oversimplified terms Relativity simply states two things.\n\nOne that there is no universal ‘at rest point’, it all depends on how you choose to define it. You sit in a car doing 100mph and I stand beside the road. Normally we assume that you are in motion and I am at rest. Relativity states that we can just as accurately say that you and the car are at rest and I am moving at 100mph. Alternatively, we normally believe that the Earth orbits the sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Relativity states that it is just as accurate to say that the Earth orbits the moon and the sun orbits the Earth, or we could say that we all orbit some imaginary point in between all three. It is all a matter of choice what we define as being the fixed point.\n\nThe second is that the speed of light is constant regardless of whether you are at rest or moving, and regardless of how fast you move. If you are sitting in a car doing 9/10 of lightspeed and are going past me standing still beside the road and we both look at exactly the same light beam shining down the road we will both see that light beam travelling away from us at exactly the speed of light relative to both of us. You don’t see it slowed down just because you are travelling almost as fast as it is. It will move away form me just as fast as it moves away form you.\n\nThose are the basics, and they aren’t all that hard to understand, even if they don’t seem to make much sense. What Einstein did was sit down and think really hard about the logical consequences of those two points.\n\n\n>>>>>>also is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nYes.\n\n>>>>>if it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets\n>>>> in it!!\n\n\nNo. Just as the Earth doesn't suck the moon in despite having much higher gravity.\n\nThe planets orbitthe Sun. In simple terms that means they are constantly falling around the sun in a ciruclar pattern.\n\nThe best way I have heard this described for the layman  is to imagine yourself throwing a heavy weight like a shotput. You could only throw it a few metres. Now imagine standingon the roof of a house and throwing that same shotput. This time it will go much further before it hits the gorund. Now go to the top of a rally high cliff and throw it. This time the shotput will travel for 20 or 30 metres before it hits the ground.\n\nThe higher you go the further somehting thrown will travel before it hits the ground. And if you go high enough the object will travel right around the world and back to where it starts before it hits the ground. It will continue falling forever. \n\nThe planets are doing exactly that WRT the sun. We are constantly flaling aorund the sun, but we can't be sucked in because we are falling from such a great height.",8070

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",8087
6,"How do you come at these totals? ; An investment of $10,000 that earns 10% annually over the course of 40 years will amount to nearly $453,000. Over the course of just 25 years, however, that same 10 grand increases to a mere $108,347. ; To keep it very simple, the answer is: it grows exponentially by compounding interest.  With that said, over time the 10% is added to the previous years value so after each year the base value is greater.  Like I said keep it very simple after two years the interest gained is not 10%+10%=20%, but rather (1.10*1.10)-1=21.0%...this happens every year and gains momentum.  See time value of money.

I have read that it isn't always effective? ..Taking into consideration factors like weight of ammo you can carry, range,recoil,accuracy,and effectiveness against hostiles,vehicles and buildings would you prefer something else? Maybe the 7.62x39 or what about the new 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge? Any news on how this last cartridge is performing in action? Maybe they have finally found the right balance of cartridge size and effectiveness? ; Unhappy.\nHowever there are many different and important factors to keep in mind. The 556 is a small round. Its actually a 22 caliber round.  It is very light weight. Much less then the 7.62x51 (308 winchester). However the 556 is meant to be fired at full auto. The 7.62x51 (by which i will refer to as the 308) is much heavier much more powerful and has too much recoil for full auto. The 308 is still used as a sniper round, even though several others are much better, such as 30-06, or several other (e-mail me and i will tell you why they use the 308) and the 308 is the ammo used for the M240 light machine gun. the 208 is the perfect round for the light machine gun. Say any different and my brother will mix words with you. \nWhatever the government says, the 556 was designed to penetrate soviet body armor. It mushrooms when passing through body armor and actaully has more shock value (due to increased surface area) despite going through the armor. It takes too many hits to take down an opponet and wastes too much ammo. Its really a shame, because there are civial loads of 556 (teachnically 223, because they are on the civilan market) that have much heavier bullets and have far greater stopping power.\n\nthe 6.8 is too dangerous.  Say you are a Marine Force Reacon guy, or Amry Ranger and you are shooting these great 6.8 bullets and killing every enemy. No problem, right? But wait.... You have run out of ammo. you can not resupply from friendly troops, and no one has 6.8 anywhere.

The nurse told me it was not his first attempt.\nSuicidal people do not have the same thought process as ""normal"" people.They can be born that way or have a tramatic experience that ""changes"" there thought process.\nEveryone I met in the hospital said the same thing-not one of us WANTED to die we didn't think we had a RIGHT to die.\nSuicide is about a person being in so much pain,crushing pain,unbearbale pain,non-stop pain that death is a way to relieve the pain.\nYou may use any of this in your paper or email any questions to me.",8175

6,"How could the US currency collapse overnight, either realistically or unrealistically? ; Excluding terrorism or natural disasters. Also, would a stock market crash cause the dollar to collapse? If so, what scenario is needed for the US stock market to crash overnight like in 1929? ; The dollar is not directly linked to the stock market. It is a strong currency in that many developing countries, including China, stockpile dollars to give them some ""hard currency"" strength. The danger is really the longer-term decline of the dollar versus other ""hard currencies"" such as the euro and yen. The dollar is also strengthened by its ties to various commodities, such as oil, which is denominated in dollars. If Russia and the Middle East countries begin selling oil to Europe or China for euros or gold dinars in a big way, then the dollar would lose more of that stability. Inflation and investors' currency speculation are additional variables. But it is unlikely that the dollar would crash overnight, because those that you might think would benefit from this (such as China) would actually lose billions and billions overnight if all their dollar holdings lost huge value. Longterm erosion in the dollar value is much more likely.",8259

The amazing things about them are that they hold their sensitivity for a long time and these tapes can be desnsitize and resensitize as many times as possible. ; yes, they use magnetic fields.  3m appears to not publicize how the technology works (presumably for good reason, if it was well understood then it would be easy to defeat!)\n\nanyway i found a patent for a detection system that has some background that explains how they work.  basically they are a sandwich of 2 kinds of material.  one is a permanently magnetic material, and the other is a permanently-magnetizable material.  the poles of the two materials are oriented in opposite directions.  when you bring the magnetizable material near a strong magnet, it is magnetized, and the magnetic fields cancel out.\nthis allows them to pass through a detector without setting it off.  then when they are returned, they are exposed to a field that orients the magnetizable material the other way, which makes the fields add up into a strong magnetic field. this makes them set off the detector when you walk through it.\n\nmore info at the link below, which is not a patent for tattle-tape, but a patent for some kind of sensitizing/desensitizing system for tattle-tape:\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1='tattle+tape'&OS=%22tattle+tape%22&RS=%22tattle+tape%22",8308

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393

But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.

1,"melting glass? ; Is it possible to melt a hole in glass with a normal blow torch. ; No\nNot only does the torch not get hot enough (by ""normal"" I'm assuming a propane torch) but the flame isn't concentrated enough.  Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.  Stick with a specialized glass drill bit for that hole.",8595
5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602

2,"Why do I yawn all the time, I am not even tired? ; I mean I yawn all freaking day! I cant stand it! ; THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, and the one that is taught in medical school, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. \n\nStudies have shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung capacity; for the most part, we just use the air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sacs, called alveoli, don’t get fresh air, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or take a yawn to get more air into the lungs.\n\nBut certain aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning in the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t take oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reasons unclear.\n\nAnother puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn in association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).",8680

1,"Why does vitamin d cause thirst? ; For instance, drinking milk or anything else fortified with vitamin d will only make me more thirsty after 5 or 10 minutes. ; Your experience is interesting!  My first thought is as follows:  Vitamin D inhibits the renin-angiotensin system which plays a role in fluid balance (and therefore blood pressure) in the body.  You may have a genetic polymorphism (variation) creating a 'hypersensitivity' to vitamin D in this system.  However, if Vitamin D is really the cause of your thirst response, does exposure to sunlight also produce this effect in 5 or 10 minutes?  Lastly, I would expect it to take longer than 5 or 10 minutes for any vitamin D consumed to actually get into your blood stream.\n\nSo....if I haven't confused you by now, I guess the best answer I can offer is.... ""that's a good question!""\n\nBest wishes and good luck!",8721

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788

Now I can't think of a serious punishment for women who commit these same crimes other then sewing their vagina shut.  Both sound inhuman, right?

This kind of reasoning has already gone so far that some courts have convicted parents for giving birth to children that they knew ahead of time, from prenatal tests, would be deformed!\n\nIt should be kept in mind that this same logic leads to the murdering of larger deformed human beings who live elsewhere (that is, outside the womb.) The logic of abortionists leads inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia. Even some pro-abortionists (Joseph Felcher, for example) admit that the two issues are logically tied together. In fact, there would be greater logical justification for taking the life of someone already known to be deformed than one which prenatal tests have simply indicated might be. ; Oh, please state your source. I'd love to hear the details of a case where parents were convicted (of what, you don't say) for having a deformed baby.\n\nNo one has a right to a ""meaningful life."" Life is what you make it.

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

2,"how do u know when ur bipolar and what can a 14 year old girl do to get help? ; i need to know this answer bad... ; Well, first you need to look at your family history.  Has anyone in your family ever been bipolar or had bipolar tendencies?  If so, then here's the second question:  Are you ADD or ADHD?\n\nHere's my personal story:\n\nI started my period at 11.  By 13 I hit ""teenager"" years and by 14 I was into puberty.  You know, boobs, hair, voice, the works.  Except something happened.  I turned into Frankenstein's Mood monster.  I was always either really excited and upbeat, or so depressed that I would stay in my room for days and bite off anyone's head who tried to talk to me.\n\nMy family became so distraut that they finally talked about sending me to a boarding school.  the house was always tense, but I thought it was everyone else.  I was kicked out several times, moved back home, and just barely made it through my teen years without going crazy.  When I was 21, I married, and my husband saw the same thing in me - we were always fighting, and I knew it was always my fault.  I felt crazy because my moodswings were so bad.\n\nAfter lots of research and lots of crazy doctors trying to prescribe me medicines, I learned the most facinating thing:  Kids who are ADD or ADHD and go through puberty actually experience bipolar tendencies.  It's a natural, hormone-imbalance.  And since I was ADHD my whole life, it was normal.  Man I wish someone had know that back then!!!!!!\n\nHere's what you need to do:  Find out if you're ADD or ADHD.  Change your diet from sugars and white flours to lots of grains, good dark green vegetables, and unprocessed sugars and eat healthy.  Exercise and work out regularly.  Talk to your doctor about natural ways to balance out your hormones through this period.  It's possible.\n\nIt's okay, you're going to be alright.  You'll make it through this, even though now it doesn't seem like it. \n\nIf it is bipolar, you would have known at an early age, before this time.  Since you're 14 and starting to experience these symptoms, I would say most likely it's that your hormones are turning you into a woman.  Hang in there, girl!",9004

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

So for you sister her ""ideal"" weight would be 140lbs.  Keep in mind that this is just a guideline.  Other factors which will affect this are genetics, bone structure and muscle mass.  Small bone structure will obviously weight less.  And since muscle weighs more than fat, a more muscular person will weigh more than the same physical size person with a higher % bodyfat.  My guess is your sister sounds like she is pretty thin, with a small bone structure and not much muscle mass.  And I would think she would benefit from starting a full body resistance exercise routine to add a little more healthy muscle mass and probably improve your body shape as well (muscle gives shape to the body).",9126

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146

However, i was a shy boy (though still is) and the fact is that she had boyfriends one after another THROGHT OUT the teen years. and God know how many times i felt sour and my heart sank whenever i saw her with her guy(s).\n\nDuring the poly years, i had a girlfriend and she was having a relatively more committed relationship. so my heart was with my girl at the time and hence u can only say that i have been a secret admirer ""on-and-off"" for 10 years.\n\nOFF, is when i have a gf, my heart have no one else. and even when i'm single, i won't fall for a girl who is attached.\n\nON, is for the times when we were both unattached. it kind of give me hope bcoz she is available. For the past 10 years, i never take any action for these ""on"" periods. \n\nFor the past 2 months, we kind of reconnect our communication. Bcoz i'm studying in uni now and she is working, we have chance to chat for few hours daily on MSN. (mon-fri working hours only though, coz she don't usually use msn at home)\n\nFrom recent chats, \nshe told me that she is now single, and she mentioned that she is not a late-queen for dates nowadays. \nAnd after she know that i used to have one painful and hurtful relationship, she said that ppl have to move on and ""if there's a good girl whom u like then give it a try"" \nShe also claims that she only regard herself who had only 2 relationships coz sec sch histores are just childish ones.\n\nWe talked a lot rubbish, shared a lot of views, joked a lot and ""suan"" each other a lot and i feel (or maybe only i feel)that we start to have some connection.\n\nSo, last week, i managed to find some courage a said.. \n\n""you wrote on my sec sch autograph book that i can call u anytime, so.. can i call u tonight??"" \n\nbut she replied ""lol.. i have a dinner appointment tonight."" \n\nI was rather disappointed. I thought, if she doesn't mind me calling she would have state a time or sth. \n\nBut soon after, she said ""next time we catch up with a movie, after your exam?"", ""when your exam finish?"", ""talk is cheap, fix a date now""....\n\nso, our tentative date (or sec sch class monitor-monitress re-union if putting it mildly) is 3 dec!! just 2 days aft my exam. But the point is that we only chat on MSN and have not advanced into phone-talk and constant sms-es.\n\nI keep thinking of her recently. and thinking..\nShd i postpone it? coz i just had a bad haircut.\nwhat shd i say? how shd i behave? will i just blush and panic? is that anything in my walldrode that can match her smile and style? shd i pay for everything? where shd we eat?? It's not like i don't have experience.\nAlthough i had gf before. But this time is different. She is a special person to me.

The romantic female side of me thinks it has great potential to be a wonderful love story.  That's the problem.  Love stories are just that..stories.  In reality you sound like a stalker.  It is just not that serious for this girl.  She probably sees you as an old school chum she would not mind spending an evening with sometime.  \n\nIt seems to me that you need to move on with your life and get out more.  Consider it just a date.  I thought only women thought things through this deeply when it came to relationships.  Hearing a man confess to such flights of whimsy (the gift, the love note confession, et' all) is a little creepy to be honest.  Sensitive is nice, obsessive is just creepy.  You sound obsessive, or at least quite immature and inexperienced.  Almost a stereotype of, well, an engineering student.  \n\nDon't confess undying love.  Don't buy a gift.  Don't write the love note.  Don't sweat the haircut.  Just pick her up.  Take her to dinner, enjoy the moment, escort her home and tell her you'd like to see her again.  \n\nYou've waited 10 years, so you have time.  Get to know her.

One thing to look at before jumping into one of the is the accredation of the company offering the course(s).  In order for the credit that you earn with one of them to be transferable, the place offering the credit MUST be accredited by a national AND regional accrediting body.

2,"What causes enlarged tastebuds, and how do they form? ; I thought perhaps it was a matter of tongue damage and subsequent swelling, but it seems daft that if you burn or bite your tongue, only one bud would swell up. I've also dismissed the idea of it being hormonal, because if that were the case, teenagers would have a lot more of them, and post-menopausal women a lot less. So does anyone actually know what's up? ; A swollen taste bud can be caused by a number of things. Very hot food that burns and irritates a taste bud can cause swelling. Allergies to specific foods can also cause it. Taste buds that taste sweets are located on the tip of the tongue and salt taste buds are in the two side areas of the tongue tip. Sour taste buds are situated on the lateral sides of the tongue and bitter taste buds on the back. The area of the tongue where the swollen taste bud is located can be a sign of which taste is involved.\n\nA swollen taste bud can occur from continually eating spicy foods which constantly overstimulate these sense organs. Trauma from biting the tongue can result in taste bud swelling.\n\nIf you need more information on your enlarged taste buds, you can go to the following web site:  http://www.atlantadentist.com/swollen_taste_bud.html\n\nAlso this site has an e-mail link and a phone number you can use to contact them and ask any more questions you may have.\n\nHope this helps you out :-)",9415

However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

6,"On a bad debt unpaid(auto repo) can a collections agency or lawayer collect when it has been nearly 10 yrs. ? ; The wife of the husband was sold the vehicle and she had no job. The husband (now x-husand) for many years, he never paid the lst. paymnet.Eventually, it was repo. The dealer ship, collection agencies, now a lawyer has harrassed her for many years for the loss of resale. Can they collect or sue her for this balance?  Could she sue them for harrassement? She has a call from a lawyer's office regarding this which seemed odd. No registered mail has come.She has been a single mom for years and limited income. Please help us with this situation. ; Here are a couple thoughts.\n\nFirst, the FCC and FCRA (fair credit reporting act) both have something to say about harassing phone calls.  There are only certain times during the day when collection agencies and their affiliates are allowed to call a debtor.  Furthermore, they are not allowed to contact a debtor at work or on a cell phone (assuming that the debtor has dutifully informed them that the number is a cell or work number).  She can easily file a complaint with the FCC about the harassing behaviour if these companies aren't complying with the regulations.\n\nThis person needs to look up the statute of limitations for collecting a debt in her area (or for the area in which she lived when the contract was signed).  My understanding is that a business is legally entitled to try to collect on a debt forever and there isn't a statue of limitations.  However, if this person was married during the time or was under 18, she may be able to prove that it isn't her debt legally, allowing her to stop collection efforts.\n\nAlso, any type of communication that this person has with these agencies or their affiliates is voluntary unless she's been given legal notice.  That being the case, I recommend that she simply ignore them and they'll go away because it's just not worth their time to keep bothering you.  They'll write off the debt before too long.\n\nSuing the companies for harassment would just aggrivate the situation and cost her time and money which, presumably, she can't afford.\n\nFinal suggestion:\n- Contact a local consumer assistance hotline.  You might be able to find one by contacting your local PIRG (USPIRG site: http://www.uspirg.org/)\n- Obtain copies of her credit report from all three CRAs and determine if anything has been posted regarding this debt.  If applicable, follow the CRAs requirements for having the debt removed if it was reported.",9505

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.

As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

I've been studying and teaching Shotokan Karate for over 20 years and I can tell ya that the ""side benefits"" are way more important than just being able to fight. \n   In my personal opinion, it is the self confidence I have gained through training that is the greatest thing to me. By this, I don't mean that I'm arrogant. I don't go around bragging about my ability, I don't go looking for fights, and I can't catch bullets with my teeth. What I mean is that if a situation does arise, I KNOW I can handle it. \n   You take on a different viewpoint when you know that you can really hurt someone...when you know that you could break bones, cripple or kill someone if you really had to. The question becomes ""Was what this guy did REALLY worth hurting him that badly? Does he REALLY deserve that?""\n   So, when some loudmouth ticks you off and insults you or your siginficant other, you have the self confidence to walk away. You know you could go hand him his butt on a silver platter, but you don't HAVE to just to prove a point to yourself. When some immature clown says, ""Hey, you take Karate...show me something!"" you know you don't have to get into a sparring match just to prove to them that you are good. \nYou get to that point when you don't feel you have anything else to prove to yourself, and you certainly don't have to prove anything to anyone else. A sort of serenity sets in when you realize that life is not a competition where you win when you are the absolute best and everyone knows it. You're good.....you're good enough that you can deal with something BAD if it should happen. That's all that matters.",9727

Volume occupied by one mol of gas is 22.4 L at standard temperature and pressure (STP: 760 mmHg and 273 K (0 C))\nTo find the volume of gas that weighs 2.57 g at STP, use formula: P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2, where R is 0.08206, P1=319 mmHg, V1=2 L, T1=298 K; P2=760 mmHg, T2=273 K and V2 is unknown (it will be somewhat less than 1 L).\nAfter you get this volume, see how many mols do you have in it: divide 22.4 by V2 you just got. Then multiply this number by 2.57 and get the molecular mass of your compound (M(X)).\n\n2. Multipy M(X) separately by 0.6481, 0.136 and 0.2159 to get number of atomic weight units that are allocated to C, H, and O respectively. \nThen divide first number by 12, 2nd by 1 and 3rd by 16 to see how many atoms it amounts to. The resulting integer numbers are X, Y, Z.\n\n3. CxHyOz is the empirical formula of your compound. Google it to get the possible molecular ones.

Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came to Earth in an attempt catch Zeus with the nymphs.\n\nEcho wanted to save her nymph friends, so she talked to Hera incessantly in order to distract her and allow time for Zeus and the nymphs to leave. However, Hera eventually interrupted Echo and went into the field where Zeus and the nymphs had been. When she saw the field was empty, Hera realized what Echo had done and punished her.\n\nOvid's version of events states that Zeus employed Echo to occupy Hera whilst he continued with his adulteries. Hera soon saw through this ruse and punished her so that she could say only the last words of other people's sentences (echolalia). She could not speak of her own accord and so was deprived of the thing she loved the most.\n\nIn the time of Echo's suffering, there was a human named Narcissus. He was so handsome that every girl or boy that saw him immediately fell in love with him. But Narcissus had no heart, and loved no one.\n\nOne day, Echo met Narcissus and, like every other girl and boy, fell in love with him. Echo could not speak to him, but she had felt she needed to see him. So Echo followed him, just enough to see him, but not enough to be seen.\n\nNarcissus became lost and called out, ""Is anyone here?""\n\nEcho said, ""Here, here, here.""\n\nNarcissus told whoever was there to come out. Echo came out and, because she couldn't talk, used her hands to show Narcissus how much she loved him. Narcissus, annoyed that so many people liked him, rejected her love. Echo, heart-broken, prayed to Aphrodite for death. Her prayer was answered, but Aphrodite loved her voice, so she let her voice live on.",9804

0,"For those who believe in Jesus Christ.? ; If Jesus died for ALL your sins why do you still have to go to confession. ; Good question. \nLet me see if I can explain.\n\nOkay sin is all sin, but there are 2 ""kinds"" of sin. There is sin and then there are sins (plural).\n\nAll sin seperates us from God becasue God is perfect and he can't be with sin. So sin always blocks us from him.\n\nWhen we are born, we are born in sin, therefore sin is in our hearts. (To put it another way, we have a root of sin in us) That is why we need to be saved. When we accept Christ, he forgives us and that root (sin) is gone. We are completely forgiven, and we recieve access to God. That is what salvation is.\n\nHowever, even though we are forgiven and saved, we still mess up sometimes because we are human and we're not perfect. In other words, we commit sins. The sins we commit will not keep us out of heaven (becasue we have been saved)but they will keep us from God (because all sin does that). They get in the way of our faith and hinder our prayers. (For example have you ever messed up and felt guilty, then you were hesitant to pray because of the guilt?) Those sins will always get in our way, but as soon as we confess them to God, he forgives them and takes them away. Then the block is gone and he is free to continue moving in our lives. \n\nSo think of it this way, we are saved when we accept Christ, so we no longer have to worry about going to hell. But confession helps us to maintain a good relationship with our father.\n\nLook at it this way. If you have a child, you will love your child no matter what. Hopefully you would discipline your child, but you would never seriously harm them, and you would always protect them to the best of your ability. But if the child decided to rebel, run away from home, and ""live a life of sin,"" it would be harder for you to protect the child, and the child would get hurt along the way. On the other hand, if the child was obediant and respectful to you, it would be easier and the child would be better off (safer, better taken care of becuase you would have the ability to provide better in that case). But you would still love the child either way right. In the same way, God loves us no matter what we do, but as we confess our sins and obey him, we give him more ability to care for us better. If we run away and rebel, he still loves us, but we are on our own to sufer the consequenses that go with the sin we commit. So obviously the best thing for us is to confess and stay close to our father, so that we may recieve the full protection and benefits. (Plus from the parent perspective that's what He wants us to do becasue he wants to care for us closely.)\n\nOf course how you confess is between you and God. Ultimately God is the only one you have to answer to. However confessing to others (whom you trust) often does help becasue it helps us to ""walk in the light"" and avoid sin. I personally have never been to a formal confession, but I have benefited alot from accountibility partners and groups. In other words I have turned to trusted friends and confessed to them when I needed to. They in turn prayed for me and encouraged me, helping me get through things I needed to get through in life. I would definately suggest hooking up with a person or small group where you can do this.",9812

1,"RH-NEG blood types? ; I'm curious to know if anyone has info about research being done on the origins of this type of blood factor. Some argue that it's a mutation, but if that's so then why is o-neg the universal blood. Others say it was the original blood factor, but why then is there no rheses strain in it? Any idea's or info? ; Rh Blood Types\n\n\nRh click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced blood types were discovered in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener.  This was 40 years after Landsteiner had discovered the ABO blood groups.  Over the last half century, we have learned far more about the processes responsible for Rh types.  This blood group may be the most complex genetically of all blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cells that are controlled by 2 closely linked genes on chromosome 1.\n\nThe Rh system was named after rhesus click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced  monkeys, since they were initially used in the research to make the antiserum for typing blood samples.  If the antiserum agglutinates your red cells, you are Rh+ click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  If it doesn't, you are Rh- click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  Despite its actual genetic complexity, the inheritance of this trait usually can be predicted by a simple conceptual model in which there are two alleles, D and d.  Individuals who are homozygous dominant (DD) or heterozygous (Dd) are Rh+.  Those who are homozygous recessive (dd) are Rh- (i.e., they do not have the key Rh antigens).\n\nClinically, the Rh factor, like ABO factors, can lead to serious medical complications. The greatest problem with the Rh group is not so much incompatibilities following transfusions (though they can occur) as those between a mother and her developing fetus.  Mother-fetus incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh- (dd) and the father is Rh+ (DD or Dd).  Maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells.  The risk increases with each pregnancy.  Europeans are the most likely to have this problem--13% of their newborn babies are at risk.  Actually only about ½ of these babies (6% of all European births have complications.  With preventive treatment, this number can be cut down even further.  Less than 1% of those treated have trouble.  However, Rh blood type incompatibility is still the leading cause of potentially fatal blood related problems of the newborn.  In the United States, 1 out of 1000 babies are born with this condition.\n\nRh type mother-fetus incompatibility occurs only when an Rh+ man fathers a child with an Rh- mother.  Since an Rh+ father can have either a DD or Dd genotype, there are 2 mating combinations possible:\n\ndrawings of two Punnett squares showing the possible Rh positive mates of an Rh negative woman and the probability of their children being Rh positive--100% if the father is homozygous dominant and 50% if he is heterozygous for this trait\n\nOnly the Rh+ children (Dd) are likely to have medical complications.  When both the mother and her fetus are Rh- (dd), the birth will be normal.\n  \n\ndrawing of a fetus in its mother's uterus; the placenta and the umbilical cord are highlighted\n\nHuman fetus in a mother's uterus\n(the umbilical cord and placenta\nconnect the fetus to its mother)\n \n\nThe first time an Rh- woman becomes pregnant, there usually are not incompatibility difficulties for her Rh+ fetus.  However, the second and subsequent births are likely to have life-threatening problems.  The risk increases with each birth.  In order to understand why first born are normally safe and later children are not, it is necessary to understand some of the placenta's functions.  Nutrients and the mother's antibodies regularly transfer across the placental boundary into the fetus, but her red blood cells usually do not (except in the case of an accidental rupture).  Normally, anti-Rh+ antibodies do not exist in the first-time mother unless she has previously come in contact with Rh+ blood.  Therefore, her antibodies are not likely to agglutinate the red blood cells of her Rh+ fetus.  \n\nPlacental ruptures do occur normally at birth so that some fetal blood gets into the mother's system, stimulatin",9822

You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.

I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

2,"Is there any way of recognizing whether if someone you know has multiple persona? ; No, I don't think a friend of mine has multiple persona, I just have an interest in psychology. ; Multiple personality disorder is now called Dissociative identity disorder.  There is much controversy on this disorder, with many people beleiving it doesn't exist at all.  If you want more information you can check out the DSM.  \n\nFor a quick overveiw of symptoms:\n\nPatients exhibit a remarkable array of symptoms that can resemble other neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, personality disorders, schizophrenic and mood psychoses, and seizure disorders. Symptoms of this particular disorder can sometimes include:\n\ndepression \nanxiety (sweating, rapid pulse, palpitations) \nphobias \npanic attacks \nphysical symptoms (severe headaches or other bodily pain) \nfluctuating levels of function, from highly effective to disabled \ntime distortions, time lapse, and amnesia \nsexual dysfunction \neating disorders \nsleeping disorders (insomnia, sleepwalking, night terrors) \nposttraumatic stress \nsuicidal preoccupations and attempts \nepisodes of self-mutilation \npsychoactive substance abuse[4] \nSigns of DID include:\n\ndiscussion of self in 3rd person \nnever feeling alone \ntalk of looking through others' eyes \ntalk of being half in and half out of their body \nsays ""we"" when talking about themselves \nabused as a child-87% (physically, mentally or verbally) \nOther symptoms include: Depersonalization, which refers to feeling unreal, removed from one's self, and detached from one's physical and mental processes. The patient feels like an observer of his life and may actually see himself as if he were watching a movie. Derealization refers to experiencing familiar persons and surroundings as if they were unfamiliar and strange or unreal.\n\nAgain, doctors must be careful not to assume that a client has MPD or DID simply because they present with some or all of these symptoms. Another factor in the diagnosis is that all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares idea, which is to say that although many of these symptoms may be present in an individual, he or she may not necessarily have DID. For example, someone may have severe PTSD (one symptom) and self mutilate with suicidal ideas, which is 3 of the above symptoms, but will not have DID. In order for DID to be diagnosed, there must be two or more distinctly present personalities.\n\nPersons with dissociative identity disorder are often told of things they have done but do not remember and of notable changes in their behavior. They may discover objects, productions, or handwriting that they cannot account for or recognize; they may refer to themselves in the first person plural (we) or in the third person (he, she, they); and they may have amnesia for events that occurred between their mid-childhood and early adolescence. Amnesia for earlier events is normal and widespread.",9876

3,"Huge cognitive IQ increase in a child that had a delay? Is this possible with  AN IEP? ; My daughter has an IEP, she has some delays .  Her  cognitive IQ  at her old school was that of a 2 yr old.  We moved to a new state and they say her cognitive IQ is normal . It's hard to beleive that her cognitive  IQ (18 mothes later) is that of a 5 yr old . I'm wonering if this is possible or if theres an error? ; There are many factors involved here, and you have had some very good answers.  IQ tests tend to not be very accurate with young children for a whole variety of reasons, and it can be expected that tests given later will produce different scores. It also depends for example, on the particular test used.  \n\nDid you daughter have lots of special programming and attention after the first test?  If so, that teaching may have helped her make some significant gains in her skills.  Does she seem to be progressing very well?  If so, her delays may have been developmental, and she may  ""catch up"" quite a bit, given lots of good programming.\n\nWith all of that said, it is really impossible for any of us to give you an absolute answer to your question, because we don't know your daughter, which test was used, etc. but anything is possible.  However, the difference you describe is quite a big one, and as you said, it is hard to believe that there could be that much improvement so quickly.  \n\nPay particular attention to your daughter and her development over the next months.  Stimulate her learning as much as you can.  Ask her teacher what you can do at home to help her progress even more than she has, but don't overwhelm her with too much work and practice.  Most likely she will be tested again  in a year or so, and then you may have a better answer.   \n\nBest of luck to you and your daughter.",9946

Like: flu symptoms, coughing, fever, tiredness, being cranky, dizzy and several more. \n\nThat is why the slow detox is best to start out with.
