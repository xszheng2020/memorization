1,"Marble Rollocoster? ; I am learning about Nutin's law an object going in a straight line will remain to until it is acted on. I am doing an obsticle corse for it in school, so does anyone know anything that will slow a marble down? ; A marble is a rolling mass.  The theory is that the marble rolls along and the area of the marble in contact with the surface it is rolling on is not slipping.\n\nAs the marble rolls along, the forces that act on it are \n\n1.  Gravity\n\n2.  Air resistance\n\nI recommend that you focus on gravity to create forces of predictable magnitude and direction.  You can use ramps and then apply Newton's laws and a little trig to calculate the force magnitudes and predict the motion of the marble. As long as you have a decent velocity without being too fast, air resistance will be negligible.\n\nI designed a simple track for you that you could make out of light plywood and some glue.\n\nThe track I propose will be a valley that is 2 meters long (a little over 6 feet) and 1/2 meter wide( 20 inches wide will give you some margin).  The valley sides are set at an angle of 30 degrees.  At one end of the valley at the top of the valley side set up a ramp that will inject a marble such that the direction of the velocity of the marble is straight with respect to the edge of the valley.  The height of the ramp will control the velocity of the.\n\nNow, consider a coordinate system that has x starting from the same end as the ramp and running parallel to the sides of the valley.  y is perpindicular to the sides of the valley.\n\nI created a variable, h, that is the vertical height of the starting end of the ramp with respect to the entry point of the marble.\nUsing conservation of energy, the velocity of the marble will be related through the equation:\n1/2*m*v^2=m*g*h\nv=sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nThe time it will take the marble to roll the length of the valley I set as t\nlength of the valley is 2m\nso 2m=v*t\nt=2/sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nWhen the marble enters the top edge of the valley it will have a velocity in the x direction of v as derived above.  This is your constant velocity since the only forces that will act on the marble in the x direction is air resistance, which we will assume to be negligible.\nSince the marble enters the valley near the top edge, it will be acted on by gravity to pull it down the edge.  If you have the marble enter the ramp at exactly .25m from the center, it reach the center of the ramp in time t'\nwhere \n.25=1/2*g*cos(30)*t'^2\nor t'=sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\n\nI thought it would be fun to consider an experiment where you control how many times the marble rolls across the center of the valley before exiting at the other end.\nThis I set as N\nNote that t/t'=N\nN=(2/sqrt(2*g*h))/sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\nN=2*sqrt(g*cos(30))/sqrt(2*g*h*.5)\nN=2*sqrt(cos(30)/h)\n\nThen I thought that it would be fun to set up an equation where we decide how many Ns we want according to how high we set the end of the ramp.  Sound like fun?\n\nN^2=4*cos(30)/h\nh=4*cos(30)/N^2\n(h is in units of meters)\nN   h(m)   h(inches)\n3    .385    15.15\n4    .0771   3.04\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nj",9

8,"Why do my fiance and I fight? ; It seems like lately, both my fiance and I are more irritable and we argue much more than usual over the stupidest things.

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain.

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

I have some foreign talent candidates that are interested. Is there a service to do this on your behalf or a recommended book to read.? ; Since you are new to this, you should consider retaining an immigration attorney.  The procedure is not rocket science, but requires some interaction with you state's Department of Labor (not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Labor) before you actually file the paperwork with the immigration.  \n\nLegal fees will probably run you about $2,000 per case (I've seen as low is $1,500 and as high as $5,000 with level of service completely uncorrelated to the price; a cheap lawyer can be as good or as bad as an expensive one); you will also have to pay a non-refundable filing fee of $1,500 per case to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  There may be other expenses, such as the cost of evaluating your prospective employee's education credentials (the law requires that H-1B workers hold at least a Bachelor's degree in the area of their proposed employment or a related area), but they are typically small compared to attorney fees and filing fees.  \n\nYou will be requried to post a notice to your employees about the fact that you are hiring H-1B workers and sign an affidavit stating that you in fact posted such notice.  \n\nYou should also remember that the best time to file for an H-1B is right after the beginning of the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1), so you should file in October or November.  Usually, USCIS stops accepting H-1B petitions in January or February, because the annual quota for H-1B visas gets filled.  If your attorney neglects to mention this at the initial interview (as some sleazy ones do), don't hire him; he is trying to charge you for putting together a petition that he knows full well will be rejected.\n\nIf you are in California, I can recommend a good attorney (knowledgeable, approachable, and reasonably priced) whom I have repeatedly used over the last few years.",536
2,"How long do I keep medical tape on a wound to heal? ; I had stitches and about 2 days after it was removed the incision line started to open back up (just a small wound). Its the weekend so I can't call the doctor so I did some research online.   A lot of people said to use medical tape because the doctor won't restitch the same spot.  How long do I keep the medical tape on before the wound closes on its own? ; The great thing about medical tape is that you don't have to worry about when to take it off.  It will come off on it's own when it is ready.  What you'll start to notice is that the tape will start peeling up around the edges.  Just trim it off with scissors.  Eventually it will fall off.  Also, do your best to keep the area covered loosely with a dry gauze or bandage, and try to keep it dry.",537

I've been taking penicillian to stave off infection. ; First of all, your biggest concern should be that you were ""shooting up"" in the first place. Second, you should NEVER EVER EVER take an antibiotic without having it prescribed by a doctor. Different antibiotics treat different kinds of bacteria, and when taken without a prescription pose a danger - they can make the infection more serious and resistant to treatment. Third - what are you thinking? See a doctor ASAP. You need treatment for whatever you have done to your arm (or leg or whatever), and you also need treatment for your drug problem. Please get help and see a doctor immediately.",559

Ethan witnesses the most recent murder.  She is put on the case and begins to get close to him.  Gena Rowlands is in it too.  In the beginning of it, it shows the killer when he is a teen and he meets this guy, kills him and steals his identity.  This is what the whole movie is about.  These kind of unsolved murders have been going on and the police are clueless.  I think Oliver Martinez is the one detective too.  Thank you! ; Taking Lives http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364045/",569
4,"If somone knows your IP address, can they access your computer and know everything? ; I am curious to know, if soemone can hack into your computer and see what you were doing either online or not online? Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?  Same situation here.  Firewalls and encryption for wireless connections are sufficient.",574

If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950

Or have your husband jokingly step in and pull you away and put his arm around you, saying ""Hey, this one's mine, yours is over there!""\n\nIf he doesn't take the hint, you can try approaching him discreetly and privately, and telling him that while you enjoy his company, the physical rough-housing isn't as much fun for you, he doesn't know his own strength, you prefer a little more personal space, etc.  Or you can go to  your friend and ask her to talk with him.

In a healthy individual, calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship, that means that when one goes up, the other goes down.  Serum calcium tends to decrease i people who have osteoporosis or inadequate intake of calcium.  Calcium needs Vitamin D to aid in absorption.  Eat foods high in calcium, or take supplements with both Vit D and Calcium. Calcium supplements should be taken 1-2 hrs after a meal to increase intestinal absorption.\nIs your low calcium-high phosphorus levels caused by an underlying condition, such as renal failure, Crohn's disease, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease?

1,"Soil Conservation? ; CausesConsequencesSolutions\nSoil Erosion•••\nDesertification\n\nSalinization•••\n•••\n\nDescribing ways in which your lifestyle directly or indirectly contributes to Soil degradation. ; Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms (in the case of bioerosion). Although the processes may be simultaneous, erosion is to be distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock. Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n\nA certain amount of erosion is natural and in fact healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continually move downstream in watercourses. Too much erosion, however, can cause problems, clogging streams with gravel, filling reservoirs with sediment, reducing soil fertility and water\n \ncauses : What causes erosion to be severe in some areas and minor elsewhere? It is a combination of many factors, including the amount and intensity of precipitation, the texture of the soil, the gradient of the slope, ground cover (from vegetation, rocks, etc.) and land use. The first factor, rain, is the agent for erosion, but the degree of erosion is governed by other factors.\n\nThe first three factors can remain fairly constant over time. In general, given the same kind of vegetative cover, you expect areas with high-intensity precipitation, sandy or silty soils, and steep slopes to be the most erosive. Soils with a lot of clay that receive less intense precipitation and are on gentle slopes tend to erode less.\n\nThe factor that is most subject to change is the amount and type of ground cover. When fires burn an area or when vegetation is removed as part of timber operations, building a house or a road, the susceptibility of the soil to erosion is greatly increased.\n\ncontrol : Examples of some erosion control methods include:\n\nconservation tillage \ncontour plowing \ncover crops \ngabions \nhydroseeding \nreforestation \nriparian strips \nriprap \nstrip farming \nvegetated waterways \nterracing \nwattle (construction) \nwindbreaks",1267

So you try 256 it will again display ☺ because there are only 255 characters. To know the value of an ASCII character press Alt + the req no. For eg Alt + 129 yeilds to ü.

I'm missing about an inch and a half, maybe. ; Saying your in pain may get you seen faster, but may lead to unnecessary treatment.  Despite how you feel, you should be evaluated by an endodontist (root canal specialist) since this was a trauma.  They will not be able to fix the cosmetic issue, but they may be able to expedite this with your dentist by a simple phone call.  They have some pull here.  Also, it ensures that you get the best treatment overall.

When is everyone going to relize that christianity is about your own personal walk with Christ?  God gives eveybody a choice to do exactly what they want to do. So if a person wants to go to church, claim Christ as their savior, pray and then turn around and kill somebody, then they just have that choice, God didn't create robots.  You cant associate the personal choices of people with those of all christians.  That's just like saying because a white guy with a beard robbed you, then all white guys with beards are theives. If some christians judge or do wrong, then they'll have to deal with God themselves, but for a person to use that as an excuse to reject christianity is stupid. When we all go to judgement and stand before God, he's not going to accept you saying that the only reason u didn't accept him was because of someone else's walk with him.

Only nine skeletons were in the grave. There should have been eleven. Two of Nicholas II's children were not there. Russian experts who examined the bones concluded, from photographic superimposition, that daughter, Maria, and son, Alexei, were missing. An American expert analyzed dental and bone specimens and independently determined the missing to be son, Alexei, and daughter, Anastasia.

Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

If prayer were forbidden in school, I would never get through a day of teaching!

Now, the main reason is because of his back problems. Plus, at first he was doing as much as he could with his back problems, but when his team, the Rockets were not winning, he felt frustrated. Whoever said that Yao is ""self-fish"" is a moron. Yao is actually helping T-Mac by reducing the load that T-Mac is used to carrying. T-Mac does not want to do all the work! He needs the help! Look at Shaq and Kobe. Seperately, They have better individual stats, but their teams are not doing as well as when they were both with the LA Lakers. It's about the team helping each other out, not T-Mac gets all the minutes and points. Sure, T-mac will get better stats, more minutes, and more points, but they will not win.

9,"What do you think about illegal immigrants? ; Should they be allowed and tolerated, or should we start cracking the whip? ; You know there are probably a lot of terrorists arleady here.  What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice.

Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head.

6,"2 dollars bills? ; how come the u.s. is not making any more 2 dollars note??? ; In spite of its relatively low value, the two-dollar bill is one of the most rarely seen denominations of U.S. currency. This is partly due to the low production of the note; approximately 1% of all notes produced today are $2 bills. Two-dollar bills, unlike other denominations, are not frequently reissued in a new series. This is because bills are printed according to demand. When the Federal Reserve Banking System runs low on its current supply of $2 bills, it will submit an order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which will then print more. Demand for $2 bills is low enough that one printing can last for many years. There is still a large supply of series 1976 bills that have not been circulated.\n\nIt is still a common perception that the $2 bill is rare, and when the general public encounters them, the bills are frequently hoarded and not circulated. According to the Treasury, they ""receive many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation."" [1]. In response, the Treasury states: ""The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations. According to BEP statistics, 590,720,000 Series 1976 $2 bills were printed and as of February 28, 1999, there was $1,166,091,458 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.""",2693

0,"Is Bernard Lonergan more influened by his Louvain heritage than by Aquinas historically understood? ; That is to say, the Louvain tradition was commissioned by Leo XIII to answer the challenges of skepticism a la Kant. Lonergan's magnum opus ""Insight"" turns out in the end to be an argument for the existence of God. In light of Victor Preller's work on Aquinas (which argues that Aquinas's Five Proofs were not meant to prove God's existence but to show the insufficiency of such proofs), should Lonergan be understood to be proving the existence of God as a response to Cartesian and Kantian epistemologies and not (goes the implication) by faithful extension of Aquinas historically understood? ; I've only been through ""Insight"" once, and read the ""Verbum"" articles years ago, so somebody might have a more detailed answer. \n\nLonergan does seem to have a Kantian agenda, though he doesn't directly engage Kant. The Kantian question is: by what right do we make metaphysical statements, such as ""God exists."" Lonergan argues by describing the process by which we makes true statements, though not in the same manner as Kant. His approach is more empirically oriented, looking at everyday experiencing and judging (whereas Kant was interested in the validity of those judgments necessary for Newtonian physics). From this basis, he argues that metaphysical judgments are possible; thus we can give an argument that God exists. \n\nIs this a faithful extension of Aquinas? Leaving aside whether or not Aquinas was interested in proving the existence of God in the modern sense, I would say yes. In fact, much of ""Insight"" sounds to me like a standard neo-scholastic epistemology manual. It's questionable whether his ""turn to the subject"" is a move Aquinas would have made, but I don't see that there's a contradiction between being a response to modern concerns and being a faithful extension of Aquinas.",2734

Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a ""gridiron,"" and so the metaphor was born.

Sounded like the teacher had a joke in mind, so here is the answer. It is very long. I have included a source so it is properly academic. \n------------------------------\nHow To Put An Elephant Into A Refrigerator\nAnalysis:\n1) Differentiate it and put into the refrig. Then integrate it in the refrig.\n2) Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).\n3) Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.\n\nNumber theory:\n1) First factorize, second multiply.\n2) Use induction. You can always squeeze a bit more in.\n\nAlgebra:\n1) Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig. Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.\n2) Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.\n\nTopology:\n1) Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.\n2) Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.\n3) The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.\n4) The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.\n5) The property of being inside the referigerator is hereditary. So, take the elephant's mother, cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.\n6) For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals. Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.\n\nAlgebraic topology:\nReplace the interior of the refrigerator by its universal cover, R^3.\n\nLinear algebra:\n1) Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.\n2) Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator. By linearity, x% will fit for any x.\n\nAffine geometry:\nThere is an affine transformation putting the elephant into the refrigerator.\n\nSet theory:\n1) It's very easy! refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the refrigerator both have cardinality c.\n\nGeometry:\nDeclare the following:\nAxiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.\n\nComplex analysis:\nPut the refrig. at the origin and the elephant outside the unit circle. Then get the image under the inversion.\n\nNumerical analysis:\n1) Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term.\n2) Work it out using the Pentium.\n\nStatistics:\n1) bright statistician. Put its tail as a sample and say ""Done.""\n2) dull statistician. Repeat the experiment pushing the elephant to the refrig.\n3) Our NEW study shows that you CAN'T put the elephant in the refrigerator.\n\nTo place a lion into the same refrigerator. Open the refrigerator door take out the elephant and put the lion in.",2806

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.  Have faith that what you really need will be available to you when the need actually arrives.  Never lose hope...it is stronger than experience.  Live life!!!",2871

9,"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity shouldn't African Americans receive also? ; Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice. ; Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm.  Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.  All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery, after all, since some immigrated to America after slavery, or since some have no slave ancestors.  It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry, and then to divide some sum proportionately.\n\nAdditionally, the vague ""400 yr+ of oppression"" is unhelpful in crafting legislation.  Slavery ended.  Segregation did exist also, that's ended for over 50 years now.  If you're problem with ""White supremacy and injustice,"" then I'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem.  Instead, educating future generations and winning over hearts and minds is the most effective remedy to injustice.",2923
9,"Why did Democrats choose the donkey for their mascot? ; Donkeys are asses and Elephants never forget. ; When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, his opponents tried to label him a ""jackass"" for his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson, however, picked up on their name calling and turned it to his own advantage by using the donkey on his campaign posters. During his presidency, the donkey was used to represent Jackson's stubbornness when he vetoed re-chartering the National Bank.\n\nThe first time the donkey was used in a political cartoon to represent the Democratic party, it was again in conjunction with Jackson. Although in 1837 Jackson was retired, he still thought of himself as the Party's leader and was shown trying to get the donkey to go where he wanted it to go. The cartoon was titled ""A Modern Baalim and his Ass"".\n\nInterestingly enough, the person credited with getting the donkey widely accepted as the Democratic party's symbol probably had no knowledge of the prior associations. Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist, came to the United States with his parents in 1840 when he was six. He first used the donkey in an 1870 Harper's Weekly cartoon to represent the ""Copperhead Press"" kicking a dead lion, symbolizing Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had recently died. Nast intended the donkey to represent an anti-war faction with whom he disagreed , but the symbol caught the public's fancy and the cartoonist continued using it to indicate some Democratic editors and newspapers.\n\nLater, Nast used the donkey to portray what he called ""Caesarism"" showing the alleged Democratic uneasiness over a possible third term for Ulysses S. Grant. In conjunction with this issue, Nast helped associate the elephant with the Republican party. Although the elephant had been connected with the Republican party in cartoons that appeared in 1860 and 1872, it was Nast's cartoon in 1874 published by Harper's Weekly that made the pachyderm stick as the Republican's symbol. A cartoon titled ""The Third Term Panic,"" showed animals representing various issues running away from a donkey wearing a lion's skin tagged ""Caesarism."" The elephant labeled ""The Republican Vote,"" was about to run into a pit containing inflation, chaos, repudiation, etc..\n\nBy 1880 the donkey was well established as a mascot for the Democratic party. A cartoon about the Garfield-Hancock campaign in the New York Daily Graphic showed the Democratic candidate mounted on a donkey, leading a procession of crusaders.\n\nOver the years, the donkey and the elephant have become the accepted symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. Although the Democrats have never officially adopted the donkey as a party symbol, we have used various donkey designs on publications over the years. The Republicans have actually adopted the elephant as their official symbol and use their design widely.\n\nThe Democrats think of the elephant as bungling, stupid, pompous and conservative -- but the Republicans think it is dignified, strong and intelligent. On the other hand, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn, silly and ridiculous -- but the Democrats claim it is humble, homely, smart, courageous and loveable.\n\nAdlai Stevenson provided one of the most clever descriptions of the Republican's symbol when he said, ""The elephant has a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by grasping the tail of its predecessor.""",2931

We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

6,"Get married or buy a house first? ; My fiancee and I have been talking about buying a house for almost a year and we're getting into a financial position where we may be able to.\nWe are both wondering whether it would be better to have a wedding first or to get married.  We both agree that buying a house is more important to us then getting married right now.  We still want an actual nice wedding ceromony, we don't want to get married at the courthouse just to facilitate buying a house.\nWe are planning on buying a house in Virginia or North Carolina.  Should we concentrate on buying a house or planning a wedding? ; It really depends on what kind of nuptial ceremony you plan on having?  Something informal with low overhead?  Then sure, get married first as that won't crunch the pocket book.  Now if you want a ""Cinderella"" wedding, then WAIT!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely purchase a house first!! Housing prices generally continue to go up, hence, equity in your pocket!! If you are worried about what family will say, who cares?? It's your life and you are only trying to better it!\n\nGood luck :)\n\nP.S......... purchasing a house sans marriage has absolutely NOTHING to do with who gets what should you seperate prior to getting married.  How you take title DOES!!  Should you purchase the home prior to marriage, you would each take title in your individual name, then after each of your names, you would state ""single man"" and ""single woman"" (assuming neither of you has been married before.  If either of you has been married before, then after that person's name it would say, ""unmarried man/woman"".  You would then have to decide that should one of you die before the other whether or not you want to leave your share of the house to the other person OR to someone else.  I'll give you an example of each:\n\nThis would be if both have never been married before AND want to leave the house to the surviving partner:\n\nJonh Doe- single man and Suzie Smith-single woman as joint tenants.\n\nNow if each of you would prefer to leave your half of the house to someone else, this is how you would take title (again, assuming neither of you has been married):\n\nJohn Doe-single man  (list his percentage of ownership) and Suzie Smith-single woman (list her percentage of ownership) with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this case, you would state in a will or trust or even on a notorized piece of paper, ""who"" your percentage of the house goes to. Also, in either example, if one of you has been married you would just change out ""single"" to read ""unmarried"".\n\nmb",3368

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

Also where in their bodies do they make the webs?  Do you know what kind they might be? ; Many different types of tree-leaf feeding caterpillars do this; there are at least two reasons. As forex says - if a predator, like a spider, approaches, some species drop on a line of silk to avoid getting eaten. At other times and with other types of caterpillars, they dangle on a line because they're ready to turn into moths. They need a safer place to make a cocoon and pupate so they dangle until it feels right and then, hopefully, the wind will blow them into a lower, warmer and safer place to spend the winter in their cocoon. In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look. They spin silk from modified salivary glands which secrete a strong, elastic thread through spinnerets right next to their mouths; it’s similar to spider silk but their own recipe.",4300

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

0,"Interest in Islam? ; In brief I am very interested in Islam, having just got back from a tour of Jordan. I've looked at a number of websites but they all seem to say the same things. What is the best way to advance my knowledge/ become a Muslim? I am learning Arabic to read the Qu'ran, but have an English version at the moment. Would walking in to a mosque be the best idea? I am in the South West of the UK.\n\nI am a white British citizen and want to become a Muslim.\n\nNo hate mails here please, this is a sensible question requiring only sensible answers. ; It's something to study in the context of a history of religion, I think, because it will seem too alien to you if you study it strictly as an outsider becoming a convert.  You will have to repress your feelings of intellectual analysis.  If you are young enough to be still in college, or planning to go to college, you could do a lot worse than major in history and specialize in history of religion.  Such people are going to be necessary to the modern world of clashing religious groups.\n\nBut if you start with the academic study, and you continue to feel it is appropriate for you, then phone a local Muslim organization and ask them what to do.  Accept that they may be suspicious of you for a while; things are tense in the religious world between Muslims and the mostly Christian world.  They see white skin, they may think spy.  Be patient and friendly, and not too pushy, and I'm sure they will recognize your sincerity eventually.  A strong academic background will give you something you can talk about with them, and they will respect your scholarship.  The Arab world generally sees scholarship as something they want for themselves, but they do it their way, of course.",4426

2,"is Ginkgo a good herbal suplement? ; has any one tried this before? ; Medical uses\nThe extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and ginkgolides and has been used pharmaceutically. It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nOut of the many conflicting research results, there seem to be basically three effects of Ginkgo extract on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals (antioxidant); and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders. Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication.\n\n Side effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ginkgo should also not be used by people who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women without first consulting a doctor.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include: possible increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, and restlessness.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced consumption should be halted immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40–200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nAnd that's My Best Answer!",4465

Your answer is mostly appreciate ; Looking forwards to hear from you, for I need ur support! ; I feel sorry for your anxiety caused by your phobia and for the other people writing about their phobias in your answer column. I to have suffered with many different phobias; as a child it was injections (both dentists and doctors), and Dogs; now it is the feeling of fear itself that I fear. (Because of years of panic attacks)\n\nI can tell you what helps, if you need to take an oral pill (tranquilizer) if you are really bad (one every night before going to bed for a short time) or (half an hour before you need to go to the doctor for an appointment involving an injection). \n*However this will not teach you too become brave or help you cope with your underlining fear which has become a phobia. \n\nI suggest you learn to relax through different sources.\n\nFirstly you can do positive self talk as your fear comes from negative thoughts causing you to have a chemical release in the brain which in turn causes the physical sensations of heart racing, sweating, feelings of faintness, fear, anxiety, nausea, light headedness, numbness, and so on…..oh yeah feelings of unreality is another one.\n\nNext learn relaxation or meditation either through physical participation in yoga classes or by listening to these sorts of cd, tape, or videos. There are hypnotic and relaxation available through JB Hi Fi stores designed to relax and strengthen your subconscious.  Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.  However this option is the most expensive and time consuming because it takes many sessions and time to feel you can trust or open up fully to another person.\n\n\n\n*If you use drugs as a crutch you can become addicted and that would start a whole new problem. \nP.S. the side affects of many tranquilizer drugs are feelings of anxiety and panic which you don’t want anyway.\n\n*The body is affected the same with legal and illicit drugs (downers or relaxants) like tranquillizers, sleeping pills or (marijuana, heroin, and alcohol) \n*Stimulants which are (speed, & cocaine) (cigarettes = nicotine), (tea & coffee =caffeine), and (ice & ecstasy which is often a combination of both stimulants and relaxants). \n*Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Marijuana are most accepted by the general public however they cause the most disease related deaths. Through internal organ diseases, like *Cancers and Blood clots (causing amputations, strokes and heart attacks) \n*Lung diseases from asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer.  \n*Liver diseases from damage trying to alienate the body of toxic poisons and chemicals associated with medications and alcohol over years. \n*Hepatitis, sclerosis, and cancers of the liver.  \n*Marijuana has a chemical THC which our body has receptor in our brain and we also store for long periods in our blood and fat cells; (up to one month each time you smoke just one joint). Regular bong smokers and users will cause many different chronic health problems including lung disease (as the same toxic chemicals are in tobacco and marijuana excepting nicotine which is a stimulant) mental health suffers with paranoia, anxiety, fear, loss of memory, loss of appetite or increased appetite for sweets, loss of motivation, poor health, poor sleeping patterns and a dependency to use marijuana to get to sleep. Personal hygiene problems like sweating, bad breath and rotting teeth and the best for last you only feel mellow for a short time the rest of the time you are short tempered and unbearable to be around.\n*All drugs both legal and illicit have one thing in common the same side affects which is anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.",4735

5,"Any Ideas On What To Do On The Weekends With Your Husband And 5 Month Baby When It Is .? ; LIKE GOING TO THE ZOO,SHOPPING,ECT. ; A five month old wouldn't enjoy the zoo, but if you want to go, five months is a good time if the baby can sleep in a stroller. If your little one must take a nap in her/his crib, then forgo the long outing. Five month old babies are amused by anything, as you know, but only in small doses. I think you should try to find local places that take only a short drive to and from - that way you maximize your time at the place you want to be, and your baby probably won't fall asleep in the car on the way back if it's a short trip. I recommend just staying in your yard (if you have one) and playing or gardening; there are lots of things outside that would interest a five month old. Buy a bag of rice and dump it in a bowl; let him/her mess around with it outside, then hose it away when s/he is done. Buy a flat of cheap annuals along with whatever other flowers/vegetables you would like to grow; give your baby a clump of flowers (minus much of the soil) and let him destroy them (it's a great learning experience). You may want to take off his clothes before you do that.  :o)  The thing about outings with a baby is it can be more tiring than you may think.",4892

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness. It is often brought on by stressful situations, such as relationship difficulties, health problems, the aftermath of an accident or the death of a loved one. \n\nThe mental illness known as a ""nervous breakdown"" may also be something like panic attacks, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder. \n\nSurveys show that about one-third of Americans feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown at some point. Studies estimate that 50-million Americans suffer some form of mental illness in their lifetime. \n\nThere are many disorders that can fit within the criteria of ""Nervous Breakdown"", but those that most commonly occur are those related to:\n•Anxiety \noGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \noPanic Disorder \n•Panic Attacks \n•Trauma Disorders \noPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder \noAcute Stress Disorder \n•Psychotic Disorders \noSchizophrenia \n•Mood (Affective) Disorders \noDepression \noBipolar Disorder",5073
7,"How about this joke? ; Three turtles, Joe, Steve, and Poncho, decide to go on a picnic. Joe packs the picnic basket with cookies, bottled sodas, and sandwiches. The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. \nBy the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. \n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady. \n\nTwenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. ""I NEED FOOD!"" he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. \n\n""NO!"" Joe retorts. ""We promised."" \n\nFive more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat.

1,"Does blood plasma contain oxygen or fibrin protein? ; This question was on my exam today. I looked it up but still not sure. Oxygen is insoluble in water and plasma is made up of 90% water. Also fibrin is a substance converted from fibrinogen protein. If fibrinogen protein is in plasma, does this mean that fibrin protein is in blood plasma? The question on the exam asked what was NOT in plasma: oxygen, fibrin protein, antibody, or electrolyte? ; Plasma contains a very small fraction of oxygen.Almost all oxygen is loaded in the RBC.Fibrinogen has to be converted into fibrin and this is possible when the platelets rupture to release thrombokinase.This enzyme converts prothrombin into thrombin which acts upon firbrinogen to convert it into fibrin.However this is dangerous as much of fibrin in the plasma will block the flow of blood in the  blood vessel.The blood clot is bunch of fibrin molecules.

5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.  Many people thought they'd fall apart once they lost Mulder and Hudson, but they keep contending.",5172

3,"What does ""old navy"" mean? ; I am not talking about the store, but I think it refers to a type of style. Not sure. ; The only thing I can think of that would be style related and not the store would be the Navy Pea Coats.\n\nPea Coat\nSailors who have to endure pea-soup weather often don their pea coats but the coat's name isn't derived from the weather. The heavy topcoat worn in cold, miserable weather by seafaring men was once tailored from pilot cloth — a heavy, course, stout kind of twilled blue cloth with the nap on one side. The cloth was sometimes called P-cloth for the initial letter of ""pilot"" and the garment made from it was called a p-jacket — later, a pea coat. The term has been used since 1723 to denote coats made from that cloth.",5287

I know several very ""girlish"" and very good engineers. \n\nThere are some very real and practical questions you must address before you sink $50k and about 5 years of your life into engineering school (high school counselors and even college counselors don't really understand this part). What do you LIKE to do? What do you think ""feels"" like a natural skill to you? Is this electrical work, gears and mechanics, chemistry, computers, etc? Go with a natural fit, don't force yourself to try and love computers just because you think it's the most successful route. After you have that hammered out, find out what is in demand in your area or someplace that you want to move (yes, there are unemployed engineers with skills that don't fit the location). An easy way to do this is look at some of the job boards and find out what types of engineers people are hiring. \n\nPicking a school: this is VERY important. You must make sure the engineering school is ACCREDITED by ABET. Anyone can legally hand out non-accredited engineering degrees. ABET schools are a whole different ballgame. Don't waste your time and money! \n\nOk, you picked a school, great! At this point, there are 3 things you need to do: 1. keep your GPA over 3.2. 2. Join at least one engineering association that fits your discipline (ASME, SAE, ACM, AUVSI...many to choose from). 3. Participate in internships and/or co-ops. This will make a huge difference in finding that first job (which is the most important job, btw). \n\nIf you follow these steps, you will avoid many headaches, I promise! Good luck!",5301
2,"what is best alternative medicine for coughing  for 22 months old baby? ; I am realy sick of giving him tylenol 5 days a week.he is in Day care and every week picks up new virus. ; So young, I wouldn't apply anything directly on the baby but use a humidifier/aromatherepy diffuser. Use no more than 5 drops of PURE lavender oil and maybe a drop or 2 of chamomile.You can also use rose oil.Make sure it's PURE.Also, you can use 1 drop of any of the following PURE oils with the lavender or chamomile:eucalyptus,rosemary (be very careful with this one though-very strong!!!use a half a drop!), lemon(use half a drop!!!!), orange. It might be good for you to purchase a potpourri sachet in lavender. Again PLEASE make sure that it's NATURAL and place it in smelling distace to the crib but out of reaching distance. The color turquoise around the baby in decor or clothing will awaken the thymus chakra responsible for proper immune functioning. Also, gently using your finger to tap on his thymus gland for  a minute, will strengthen his immunities. Good luck!Please give him a kiss for me . . .but don't get sick - ok? P.s.

5,"What can be done to fix the BCS? ; The BCS is the biggest crock ever conceived. As of the Week 12 ranking, there are some inexplicable rankings. USC: 3rd? I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th). Furthermore, the Pac-10 as a league is laughable, they have one or two powerhouses that basically play scrimmages for a season and have an easy roll into the BCS bids. Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid. A playoff system needs to be established to discover a true champion, maybe use the bowl games as the playoffs leading to an ""Uber"" bowl game. Preferences should cease being given to bigger schools, both in rankings and officiating, by my count USC should've lost at least 2 other times. What say You! ; 8 team playoff in three weeks.  \n\nBut, with the system now, why should you play for the championship if you can't even beat the teams in your conference? I think the winner of the SEC will play OSU or U of M for the championship come January.",5342

Also, they should keep the bowlers like Zaheer Khan who are in good form. The best change they could probably make is the sacking of Greg Chappell plus Dravid's leave as captain.

At the level I'm at, I am able to blow away batters and strike out 7-10 a game, but I want to be able ot play in college. ; First off you have good height strong upper body helps but pitching is 30% body strength 70% technique ask yourself these questions \n\n1.do i have good balance from the point of my rotation into my stride.\n\n2.am I using full arm motion = on a 360 degree scale wich means are you releasing the ball at the top point into your stretch.\n\n3.you say you have long legs that is a good tool for alot of pitchers. question from me to you. So I can be a bit more helpful . After you go into your stretch from the wind up what is the position of your trail leg into your stretch do have a habbit of pushing off the mound . Not good gets you into bad habbits .Its more like a pulling off the mound into the stride then pushing into the release . \nA good practice for this is stand at the mound go into your routine simulate your movements to the place go step by step every motion check your body position into each step. Break it down steps 1 to 5  \n\n1.your starting stance Check your balance \n2.your raise into your windup check balance look at your footing \n\n3. from windup into your stride check balance arm position did you get proper waist rotation did you push off the mound. \n\n4 look at your arm are you at your right release point .is it in correct position if not at a perfect point gonna cause loss of velocity and cause improper control of the pitch.\n\n5 check your balance after the stretch do you still have proper balance.\n \n\n\ncauses balance issues and takes away from your volicity and has a tendency of causing alot of wild pitches. Do you see  \n  yourself with this problem?\n\nThe leg kick is a tool but if you dont have balance from the kick to the stride your wasting your time .\n\n4. Do you have proper waist rotation going from windup to the stretch this is important. (note) proper hip motion=rotation) if your not balanced going from your turn into the stride this will cause a potential  loss of velocity thats where alot of power pitchers    get this down to tee.\n\nYou say you have a 3qtr arm slot question when you release the ball at what point of your stride are you release what is your arm position .Always release the ball at the top of you stride Balance+  release point = velocity .I hope this gives you some ideas on  where your at or where you need to be at .Please feal free to e-mail question's if you have any .Id be glad to help",5578

6,"How to program a vending maching for foreign currencies? ; I wonder how I can set up vendind machines so that they can accept currencies other than americans coins or bills ; There would be two problems - getting readers that count the foreign currency, and getting up-to-date conversion rates sent to it, so that you con't get cheated by currency rates changing.\n\nYou'd have to set it up so that it either gets an update once per day, say, or like an ATM, it would 'phone home' for every transaction to verify rates.  A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.  It would be cool to select an item and just start feeding in all those different currencies until the item is paid for, and it spits out change in Dollars or something.  This would make displaying prices difficult, since you are using several currencies to pay for an item, but this would be a valuable thing to have in airports around the world.\n\nInteresting idea.",5917

I can try Rue Care Oil that not only treat the hemorrhoids but also helps to straighten the veins and can be used for this purpose after the surgery to help hemorrhoids from re-appearing. Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

3,"I have a report on to kill a mokingbird (see below for details)? ; I have a report on Mrs. Dubose's characteristics in To Kill a Mockingbird. Can someone give me all the traits and details? It is due tommorow \n\nPLEASE HELP ; summary:\n\nScout (Jean Louise) Finch lives with her brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus, in the sleepy Alabama county of Maycomb. Maycomb is suffering through the Great Depression, but Atticus is a prominent lawyer and the Finch family is reasonably well off in comparison to the rest of society. One summer, Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Charles Baker Harris (Dill), who has come to live in their neighborhood for the summer, and the trio acts out stories together. Eventually, Dill becomes fascinated with the spooky house on their street called the Radley Place. The house is owned by Mr. Nathan Radley, whose brother, Arthur (nicknamed Boo), has lived there for years without venturing outside in daylight.\n\nScout goes to school for the first time that fall and detests it. She and Jem find gifts apparently left for them in a knothole of a tree on the Radley property. Dill returns the following summer, and he, Scout, and Jem begin to act out the story of Boo Radley. Atticus puts a stop to their antics, urging the children to try to see life from another person’s perspective before making judgments. But, on Dill’s last night in Maycomb for the summer, the three sneak onto the Radley property, where Nathan Radley shoots at them. Jem loses his pants in the ensuing escape. When he returns for them, he finds them mended and hung over the fence. The next winter, Jem and Scout find more presents in the tree, presumably left by the mysterious Boo. Nathan Radley eventually plugs the knothole with cement.\n\nTo the consternation of Maycomb’s racist white community, Atticus agrees to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell. Because of Atticus’s decision, Jem and Scout are subjected to abuse from other children, even when they celebrate Christmas at the family compound on Finch’s Landing. Calpurnia, the Finches’ black cook, takes them to the local black church, where the warm and close-knit community largely embraces the children.\n\nAtticus’s sister, Alexandria, comes to live with the Finches the next summer. Dill, who is supposed to live with his “new father” in another town, runs away and comes to Maycomb. Tom Robinson’s trial begins, and when the accused man is placed in the local jail, a mob gathers to lynch him. Atticus faces the mob down the night before the trial. Jem, Dill, and Scout, who snuck out of the house, soon join him. Scout recognizes one of the men, and her polite questioning about his son shames him into dispersing the mob.\n\nAt the trial itself, the children sit in the “colored balcony” with the town’s black citizens. Atticus provides clear evidence that the accusers, Mayella Ewell and her father, Bob, are lying: in fact, Mayella propositioned Tom Robinson, was caught by her father, and then accused Tom of rape to cover her shame and guilt. Atticus provides impressive evidence that the marks on Mayella’s face are from wounds that her father inflicted; upon discovering her with Tom, he called her a whore and beat her. Yet, despite the significant evidence pointing to Tom’s innocence, the all-white jury convicts him. The innocent Tom later tries to escape from prison and is shot to death (though it might be that he tried to escape so he could get shot deliberately because he wanted to die looking like a hero. However, in the book, it is said that he could've escaped if he had two good arms instead of one). In the aftermath of the trial, Jem’s faith in justice is badly shaken, and he lapses into despondency and doubt.\n\nDespite the verdict, Bob Ewell feels that Atticus and the judge have made a fool out of him, and he vows revenge. He menaces Tom Robinson’s widow, tries to break into the judge’s house, and finally attacks Jem and Scout as they walk home from a halloween pageant at their school. Boo Radley intervenes, however, saving the children. Atticus at first believes that Jem fatally stabbed Mr. Ewell in the struggle. ",6166

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

I pulled my car off the road and called my brother to ask about mom he said he had just checked on her 10 minutes ago and she was just fine, I asked him to please check again because I thought she was gone.  He did and the next thing I heard was my brother crying because mom had died.  There is no doubt mom visited me the moment she died.

6,"What kind of process was used to change Michael Jackson's skin color? How much did it costs? ; Is this procedure available to general public? Are there any side affects or dangers on future health? ; No. It is not available to general public. He had to submit to this procedure due to the skin desease he has called Vitiligo. \n\nThis illness destroys the skin pigmentation in some areas of the body... causing that in a black person skin (like Michael) appear big white patches.\nThe process Michael had was to destroy the pigmentation of the rest of the still coloured skin when the illness was too advanced and he could not put make up on the white patches like he did in the beginning (Late 70s, early 80s)\n\nAlthough I think it is not too dangerous, since its a common procedure to treat patients with advanced Vitiligo it has side effects. This process destroys the pigmentation of the skin, that is the natural protection from the sun, so you have to be very careful with your skin. Especially you cannot be exposed to the sun. That's the reason Michael wears dark clothes, mask, fedora and umbrella most of the times he goes out.\nAnd probably you will have to put some creams for the skin, sun blocker or even take special medicine. \n\nThough I'm not so sure of how much this may cost...

If you are eating ANY kind of fatty foods, you are simply pouring gasoline on that fire.  Also, have they given you any other tests such as an ERCP, Endoscope, Colonoscopy, Upper GI, Lower GI or maybe even an MRI?  I just recently spent 14 days in the hospital getting regular doses of pain and nausea medication and had all of these test ran.  Luckily I do not have Pancreatitis, but I do have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is also diet related (lack of fiber usually); also there is a disease known as Crones Disease that have the same type of symptoms.

Do you have any suggestions that I could pass along? The boys are only five and six. ; Try taking the advice given here. Be prepared to march down to the school a lot to try to get this taken care of. Your grandkids CAN learn! Then, if none of that works, consider homeschooling, or have the parents consider homeschooling, whichever is more appropriate. Like some of these teachers said, they are trained to educate regular student, not special children. I know a boy with FAS and a myriad of other diagnoses, and when he was eight years old, he snuck out of a locked campus and was halfway home before his grandma was called and told he was missing. He had walked about five miles. Homeschooling gives you the advantage of knowing your grandson's individual problems. There are so many different types of problems going on in a special ed class, that I don't blame the teacher for being overwhelmed. Most special ed kids excel once they start being taught at home because they are in an environment they know, with loving caregivers who understand the complexities of their own disorders, and are able to work at their own pace. There's no distractions like there are in a classroom. It just seems to work. There are several place you can turn to to learn about homeschooling kids with special needs. Check yahoo groups, there's a lot. I'm on HS-Plus, and it's a really good group. Lots of different disorders being dealt with, FAE/FAS is a big one, so you'd get lots of help. I homeschool my autistic pre-schooler, and will be homeschooling my 'normal' little one, and any others that come along.

1,"Does the full moon affect the speed of the earth's rotation? ; Can the moon's effect on gravity and tides vary or affect the speed of the earth's rotation i.e. speed it up/slow it down ever so slightly during monthly moon phases? If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time. Of all of these Stephen Hawking's were the easiest for me to understand and the most interesting to read.  You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.  The visible phases of the moon would still have nothing to do with the affect on time however.  \n\nThat was an interesting question, I hope my answer was of some use to you!\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus\n*thanks for correcting me on the orbital change Answer Guy.",6806

Under the personnel rules of the city, her action is cause for termination. Do you dismiss her?\n\nI would really be interested in anyone who doesn't not believe that she should be fired and their logic as to why. ; I don't believe she should be fired, after all the funds came from the ""petty"" cash fund; and in the absence of an explanation for these incidences I would suggest that she must have had a compelling reason or a mental condition to engage in this aberrant behavior. The stated fact that she is a highly valued employee would suggest that salvaging her is the direction to take, sometimes forgiveness can be applied in the secular world and people who are afforded second chances often go on to become role models. The fact that she has confessed should also be considered in this argument, as this can be deemed as remorse for these actions and remorse is generally an indication that the offence will not be committed again. Perhaps this employee should be transferred to a department that will allow her to perform her duties without the temptation of money to corrupt her, as a way that this dilemma can be best resolved without her being fired or involving the authorities.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions?? ; A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.  This is one entity or energy.  \n\nThe paths we as humans choose to find this source is our differing religions each with their merits and flaws.  We seek the same source.  Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026

What are some similar schools to compare to...\n\nI just wanna hear some opinions and insights from people. ; If you're looking for reputation rankings, you should look at the US News and World Reports annual rankings.  If, however, that doesn't mean much to you, then you're in my boat and wondering by what measure should we determine what is the best school?\n\nThe best way to judge for yourself is to visit the campus and talk to people there - formally (the public face) and informally (the face you'll get without admissions office control).  For example, talk to some students at random in the union.\n\nBeing from Ohio, I know a bit more about Ohio Wesleyan.  My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.  Basically, OW wasn't even in my list of places to consider.  Perhaps some things have changed in the last 15 years or perhaps not, but no new news has prompted me to change my opinion.  I made a point of visiting quite a few universities when I was searching in 1990.  I probably visited OWU, but I don't recall.  It had that much of an impression on me.  In the meantime, Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, Kenyon, Baldwin Wallace, Maimi U, OSU, and some schools in SE Michigan DID make an impression on me and I still wonder if some of them would have been a better choice.  As it was though, I made the decision based on finding a program that was relatively unique and that I found very attractive so that it wasn't the university, but the degree program that won me over.",7102

3,"Spelling, grammer etc? ; Yeah I pretty much suck at all the spelling, grammer kinda of stuf, so can you guys help me out? I wrote this on copper:\n\nCopper comes from the Latin word cuprum. It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could. I dont know ive never really been in that situation but i can see it going bad easily if its not delt with care :) I hope that helps",7400

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Noble gases are unreactive, thus cannot chemically disturb the equilibrium. \n\nAt constant volume, however the noble gas will.

The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

As you look down at anearby smaller buidling, you observe that the angle of depression of the base is 77 degrees and the angle of depression of the top is 46 degrees.  Find the hegiht of the smaller building and the horizontal distance between the two buildings. ; Trigonometry is hard to do in you head, so start out by making a drawing. You have two buildings A (tall) and B (short) - Draw them far apart, not like this:\n\nA         B\n|         \n|         \n|    \n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n\nNow draw one line from the top of A to the top of B - this is the angle of depression of the top and it is 46 degrees. That is, if you drew a straight, horizontal line across the top of building A, the angle between that line and the line joining the top of A to the top of B is 46 degress.\n\nSimilarly, draw a line from the top of A to the *bottom* of B - this is the angle of depression of the bottom and it is 77 degrees. That is, the angle between the horizontal line across the top of A, and the line between top of A and bottom of B is 77 degrees.\n\nNow can you find out the angle between the line from A-top to B-top, and the line from A-top to B-bottom? (It's very important for you to draw this!) Let's put this value aside for a minute. \n\nLooking at your drawing, can you see that you know the value for *part* of the angle between the horizontal line across A's top and length of building A? What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom.

Solve this triangle for line B-top to B-bottom for height of building. \n\nDon't forget, we have two important angles that will help solve these two triangles!",7575
6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business. Treat your loyal customers well and they will return to you every morning and will start bringing in their friends. Give customers a few low cost freebies and taste tests. They will definitely remember your generosity. \n\nI hope that helps a bit!\n\n~Mark Lim\n\nhttp://www.poisonappleshirts.com",7576

1,"How to solve the Three-Jugs Problem mathematically (Very Complicated!!)? ; Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of water wish to share it evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

Anyone have any ideas as how i can figure out what to do? ; OK, I have a lot to say about this, so please give this a read. \n\nI have three college degrees. One is an associate's (I went to a community college), one is a bachelor's, and one is a master's. I didn't decide on my major until my junior year of college, and even then, I wasn't sure if I made the right decision. \n\nDO NOT let anyone tell you that you have to decide right away. You don't. Declare yourself a liberal arts major and take as many different classes as you can. Take what sounds interesting. Take internships. Take as much as you can! The only way to find out what you want to do is explore and experiment. \n\nAnd you don't have to know what you want to do for a living right out of high school OR college. I'm 28, and I've just decided what my ""calling"" is. It took me a long time, but I finally made it. \n\nBut I also want to go back to school for more education in areas where I didn't get to take classes. So, please, explore and don't let anyone pressure you into choosing a major.\n\nBy the way, I majored in English, and the only reason I did it is because I love to write. I didn't make the decision for careers because I'm certainly not making a lot of money off of my writing. :)\n\nGood luck, and my best to you with whatever decisions you make!",7651

CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc ; Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode.",7790

Spanish to accomadate immigrants and French I guess because most people consider it to be a beautiful language.

1,"Explain theory of relativity.? ; please explain it in simplest language.\n\nalso is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nif it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets in it!! ; There are plenty of good websites that answer this question, for any knowledge level. The concept is complex enough that you won’t get a meaningful answer here.\n\nIn horribly oversimplified terms Relativity simply states two things.\n\nOne that there is no universal ‘at rest point’, it all depends on how you choose to define it. You sit in a car doing 100mph and I stand beside the road. Normally we assume that you are in motion and I am at rest. Relativity states that we can just as accurately say that you and the car are at rest and I am moving at 100mph. Alternatively, we normally believe that the Earth orbits the sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Relativity states that it is just as accurate to say that the Earth orbits the moon and the sun orbits the Earth, or we could say that we all orbit some imaginary point in between all three. It is all a matter of choice what we define as being the fixed point.\n\nThe second is that the speed of light is constant regardless of whether you are at rest or moving, and regardless of how fast you move. If you are sitting in a car doing 9/10 of lightspeed and are going past me standing still beside the road and we both look at exactly the same light beam shining down the road we will both see that light beam travelling away from us at exactly the speed of light relative to both of us. You don’t see it slowed down just because you are travelling almost as fast as it is. It will move away form me just as fast as it moves away form you.\n\nThose are the basics, and they aren’t all that hard to understand, even if they don’t seem to make much sense.

In simple terms that means they are constantly falling around the sun in a ciruclar pattern.\n\nThe best way I have heard this described for the layman  is to imagine yourself throwing a heavy weight like a shotput. You could only throw it a few metres. Now imagine standingon the roof of a house and throwing that same shotput. This time it will go much further before it hits the gorund. Now go to the top of a rally high cliff and throw it. This time the shotput will travel for 20 or 30 metres before it hits the ground.\n\nThe higher you go the further somehting thrown will travel before it hits the ground. And if you go high enough the object will travel right around the world and back to where it starts before it hits the ground. It will continue falling forever. \n\nThe planets are doing exactly that WRT the sun. We are constantly flaling aorund the sun, but we can't be sucked in because we are falling from such a great height.",8070
1,"How do you remove a dye from a mixture? ; I'm performing this test, where everyone gets a mixture of five substances and we have to identify the substances.  Our mixture was green.  We removed one metal, one dissolved solid and we fractionally distilled our mixture so that we have separated two liquids.  Is there a dye present in the mixture?  We know that there's only one solid, because we used fractional crystalization, and there's only two liquids, because there's only two boiling points.  However, the dissolved solid is green.  Is this because the dye gave it that color, or is it originally green?  If there is a dye present, how can I separate it?  If I use the paper chromatography method, and it spreads out on filter paper, would that count as being separated?  PLEASE SOMEONE HELP!  Keep in mind that I'm in eighth grade, so I only have the basic materials (But enough). ; If the colored solid is highly conjugated with at least 9 or more conjugated double bonds, then it is probably that color.\n\nAlso if it absorbs light at the frequency of the color complementary to green than there is no dye.\n\n\nMy recommendations: Filter-vac the solid over a buchner funnel and try various washes with different solvents both organic and inorganic.",8082

When you check out books, the librarians would ""desensitize"" the books.  When you return the books, they would ""sensitize"" them.  Do these systems use magnetic fields?  The amazing things about them are that they hold their sensitivity for a long time and these tapes can be desnsitize and resensitize as many times as possible. ; yes, they use magnetic fields.  3m appears to not publicize how the technology works (presumably for good reason, if it was well understood then it would be easy to defeat!)\n\nanyway i found a patent for a detection system that has some background that explains how they work.  basically they are a sandwich of 2 kinds of material.  one is a permanently magnetic material, and the other is a permanently-magnetizable material.  the poles of the two materials are oriented in opposite directions.  when you bring the magnetizable material near a strong magnet, it is magnetized, and the magnetic fields cancel out.\nthis allows them to pass through a detector without setting it off.  then when they are returned, they are exposed to a field that orients the magnetizable material the other way, which makes the fields add up into a strong magnetic field. this makes them set off the detector when you walk through it.\n\nmore info at the link below, which is not a patent for tattle-tape, but a patent for some kind of sensitizing/desensitizing system for tattle-tape:\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1='tattle+tape'&OS=%22tattle+tape%22&RS=%22tattle+tape%22",8308

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393

2,"Why do I yawn all the time, I am not even tired? ; I mean I yawn all freaking day! I cant stand it! ; THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, and the one that is taught in medical school, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. \n\nStudies have shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung capacity; for the most part, we just use the air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sacs, called alveoli, don’t get fresh air, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or take a yawn to get more air into the lungs.\n\nBut certain aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning in the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t take oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reasons unclear.\n\nAnother puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn in association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).",8680

9,"Dose every child has a right to a meaningful life? ; First of all, what are the criteria for a meaningful life, and who decides whether or not a life is meaningful? This kind of reasoning has already gone so far that some courts have convicted parents for giving birth to children that they knew ahead of time, from prenatal tests, would be deformed!\n\nIt should be kept in mind that this same logic leads to the murdering of larger deformed human beings who live elsewhere (that is, outside the womb.) The logic of abortionists leads inevitably to infanticide and euthanasia. Even some pro-abortionists (Joseph Felcher, for example) admit that the two issues are logically tied together. In fact, there would be greater logical justification for taking the life of someone already known to be deformed than one which prenatal tests have simply indicated might be. ; Oh, please state your source. I'd love to hear the details of a case where parents were convicted (of what, you don't say) for having a deformed baby.\n\nNo one has a right to a ""meaningful life."" Life is what you make it.

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146

But God knows how many times i peeped at her during lesson instead of looking at the board. However, i was a shy boy (though still is) and the fact is that she had boyfriends one after another THROGHT OUT the teen years. and God know how many times i felt sour and my heart sank whenever i saw her with her guy(s).\n\nDuring the poly years, i had a girlfriend and she was having a relatively more committed relationship. so my heart was with my girl at the time and hence u can only say that i have been a secret admirer ""on-and-off"" for 10 years.\n\nOFF, is when i have a gf, my heart have no one else. and even when i'm single, i won't fall for a girl who is attached.\n\nON, is for the times when we were both unattached. it kind of give me hope bcoz she is available. For the past 10 years, i never take any action for these ""on"" periods. \n\nFor the past 2 months, we kind of reconnect our communication. Bcoz i'm studying in uni now and she is working, we have chance to chat for few hours daily on MSN. (mon-fri working hours only though, coz she don't usually use msn at home)\n\nFrom recent chats, \nshe told me that she is now single, and she mentioned that she is not a late-queen for dates nowadays. \nAnd after she know that i used to have one painful and hurtful relationship, she said that ppl have to move on and ""if there's a good girl whom u like then give it a try"" \nShe also claims that she only regard herself who had only 2 relationships coz sec sch histores are just childish ones.\n\nWe talked a lot rubbish, shared a lot of views, joked a lot and ""suan"" each other a lot and i feel (or maybe only i feel)that we start to have some connection.\n\nSo, last week, i managed to find some courage a said.. \n\n""you wrote on my sec sch autograph book that i can call u anytime, so.. can i call u tonight??"" \n\nbut she replied ""lol.. i have a dinner appointment tonight."" \n\nI was rather disappointed. I thought, if she doesn't mind me calling she would have state a time or sth. \n\nBut soon after, she said ""next time we catch up with a movie, after your exam?"", ""when your exam finish?"", ""talk is cheap, fix a date now""....\n\nso, our tentative date (or sec sch class monitor-monitress re-union if putting it mildly) is 3 dec!! just 2 days aft my exam. But the point is that we only chat on MSN and have not advanced into phone-talk and constant sms-es.\n\nI keep thinking of her recently. and thinking..\nShd i postpone it? coz i just had a bad haircut.\nwhat shd i say? how shd i behave? will i just blush and panic? is that anything in my walldrode that can match her smile and style? shd i pay for everything? where shd we eat?? It's not like i don't have experience.\nAlthough i had gf before. But this time is different. She is a special person to me.

Are you British?  It is of no consequence, or course, but the more I read the more you sounded like someone from the U.K. \nAnyway, in some ways it is sweet that you have admired this lady for so long.  The romantic female side of me thinks it has great potential to be a wonderful love story.  That's the problem.  Love stories are just that..stories.  In reality you sound like a stalker.  It is just not that serious for this girl.  She probably sees you as an old school chum she would not mind spending an evening with sometime.  \n\nIt seems to me that you need to move on with your life and get out more.  Consider it just a date.  I thought only women thought things through this deeply when it came to relationships.  Hearing a man confess to such flights of whimsy (the gift, the love note confession, et' all) is a little creepy to be honest.  Sensitive is nice, obsessive is just creepy.  You sound obsessive, or at least quite immature and inexperienced.  Almost a stereotype of, well, an engineering student.  \n\nDon't confess undying love.  Don't buy a gift.  Don't write the love note.  Don't sweat the haircut.  Just pick her up.  Take her to dinner, enjoy the moment, escort her home and tell her you'd like to see her again.  \n\nYou've waited 10 years, so you have time.  Get to know her.  Hopefully she lives up to the fantasy you've created all these years. \n\nGood luck.",9151

1,"How do we only see one side of the moon? ; I read somewhere that the moon rotates on its axis for 27 days, and revolves around the Earth for 27 days, too. However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.  This requires crunches but sit ups will work if you don't have access to a machine.\n\nYou could try taking creatine ester.  It causes your existing muscles to swell a little bit.  It might make you look a little better in the two weeks.  You get it at the health food store.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to tone and increase your build, you need to join a gym because its really difficult to do it without machines.  Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came to Earth in an attempt catch Zeus with the nymphs.\n\nEcho wanted to save her nymph friends, so she talked to Hera incessantly in order to distract her and allow time for Zeus and the nymphs to leave. However, Hera eventually interrupted Echo and went into the field where Zeus and the nymphs had been. When she saw the field was empty, Hera realized what Echo had done and punished her.\n\nOvid's version of events states that Zeus employed Echo to occupy Hera whilst he continued with his adulteries. Hera soon saw through this ruse and punished her so that she could say only the last words of other people's sentences (echolalia). She could not speak of her own accord and so was deprived of the thing she loved the most.\n\nIn the time of Echo's suffering, there was a human named Narcissus. He was so handsome that every girl or boy that saw him immediately fell in love with him. But Narcissus had no heart, and loved no one.\n\nOne day, Echo met Narcissus and, like every other girl and boy, fell in love with him. Echo could not speak to him, but she had felt she needed to see him. So Echo followed him, just enough to see him, but not enough to be seen.\n\nNarcissus became lost and called out, ""Is anyone here?""\n\nEcho said, ""Here, here, here.""\n\nNarcissus told whoever was there to come out. Echo came out and, because she couldn't talk, used her hands to show Narcissus how much she loved him. Narcissus, annoyed that so many people liked him, rejected her love. Echo, heart-broken, prayed to Aphrodite for death. Her prayer was answered, but Aphrodite loved her voice, so she let her voice live on.",9804
1,"RH-NEG blood types? ; I'm curious to know if anyone has info about research being done on the origins of this type of blood factor. Some argue that it's a mutation, but if that's so then why is o-neg the universal blood. Others say it was the original blood factor, but why then is there no rheses strain in it? Any idea's or info? ; Rh Blood Types\n\n\nRh click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced blood types were discovered in 1940 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander Wiener.  This was 40 years after Landsteiner had discovered the ABO blood groups.  Over the last half century, we have learned far more about the processes responsible for Rh types.  This blood group may be the most complex genetically of all blood type systems since it involves 45 different antigens on the surface of red cells that are controlled by 2 closely linked genes on chromosome 1.\n\nThe Rh system was named after rhesus click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced  monkeys, since they were initially used in the research to make the antiserum for typing blood samples.  If the antiserum agglutinates your red cells, you are Rh+ click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  If it doesn't, you are Rh- click this icon to hear the preceding term pronounced.  Despite its actual genetic complexity, the inheritance of this trait usually can be predicted by a simple conceptual model in which there are two alleles, D and d.  Individuals who are homozygous dominant (DD) or heterozygous (Dd) are Rh+.  Those who are homozygous recessive (dd) are Rh- (i.e., they do not have the key Rh antigens).\n\nClinically, the Rh factor, like ABO factors, can lead to serious medical complications. The greatest problem with the Rh group is not so much incompatibilities following transfusions (though they can occur) as those between a mother and her developing fetus.  Mother-fetus incompatibility occurs when the mother is Rh- (dd) and the father is Rh+ (DD or Dd).  Maternal antibodies can cross the placenta and destroy fetal red blood cells.  The risk increases with each pregnancy.  Europeans are the most likely to have this problem--13% of their newborn babies are at risk.  Actually only about ½ of these babies (6% of all European births have complications.  With preventive treatment, this number can be cut down even further.  Less than 1% of those treated have trouble.  However, Rh blood type incompatibility is still the leading cause of potentially fatal blood related problems of the newborn.  In the United States, 1 out of 1000 babies are born with this condition.\n\nRh type mother-fetus incompatibility occurs only when an Rh+ man fathers a child with an Rh- mother.  Since an Rh+ father can have either a DD or Dd genotype, there are 2 mating combinations possible:\n\ndrawings of two Punnett squares showing the possible Rh positive mates of an Rh negative woman and the probability of their children being Rh positive--100% if the father is homozygous dominant and 50% if he is heterozygous for this trait\n\nOnly the Rh+ children (Dd) are likely to have medical complications.  When both the mother and her fetus are Rh- (dd), the birth will be normal.\n  \n\ndrawing of a fetus in its mother's uterus; the placenta and the umbilical cord are highlighted\n\nHuman fetus in a mother's uterus\n(the umbilical cord and placenta\nconnect the fetus to its mother)\n \n\nThe first time an Rh- woman becomes pregnant, there usually are not incompatibility difficulties for her Rh+ fetus.  However, the second and subsequent births are likely to have life-threatening problems.  The risk increases with each birth.  In order to understand why first born are normally safe and later children are not, it is necessary to understand some of the placenta's functions.  Nutrients and the mother's antibodies regularly transfer across the placental boundary into the fetus, but her red blood cells usually do not (except in the case of an accidental rupture).  Normally, anti-Rh+ antibodies do not exist in the first-time mother unless she has previously come in contact with Rh+ blood.  Therefore, her antibodies are not likely to agglutinate the red blood cells of her Rh+ fetus.  \n\nPlacental ruptures do occur normally at birth so that some fetal blood gets into the mother's system, stimulatin",9822

The problem with my theory is that the main idea of Hypothyroidism is that it slows your metablism (as the thyroid's perpose is to release hormones that regulate the metabilism) and I'm not fat. I'm actualy below my recomended weight and the average for my age and height. Does this mean I have no chance of being diagnosed with Hypothoroidism? ; Ok, I'm a little confused by your question, do you think you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyriodism?  You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.  I get the two confused all the time but hyperthyroidism means your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone and hypothyroid means it makes not enough.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, a young thin person can have hypothyroidism.  I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.
