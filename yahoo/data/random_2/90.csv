0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

Most often when this occurs, you will find that the both of you crossed paths in another lifetime event. I had this experience with a now deceased girlfriend. We believed we were lovers sometime in the past. We began doing research and found my great great grandfather was on the same ship that came from europe with her great great grandmother. One of my relatives had the old dusty picture taken on that voyage in 1898 in an old locker in the attack. We found the picture and on the back was a listing of the people who were in the picture.

9,"Can John Kerry keep his freaking mouth shut, a week before the election? ; I don't think his remark will hurt the democrats in the election, most people already have their minds made up.  But he is probably done with any future national office! ; I think he really screwed up here.  What he did is a career ender, no matter what party it came from.  Lets face it, the Republicans weren't/aren't doing much to help their standing, but thanks to Mr. Kerry (which he will remain, Mr. that is) they didn't need to.  Now they need to run with it.  \n\nAlso, this thing with Kerry refusing to appologize to the troops and the military, I guess he wants to take the express train out D.C.  I didn't vote for him to 2004, and if he thinkns that he's going to get any votes in 2008, he's nuts!!  The military is one of those things that you just don't mess with.  The American People may not stand behind the leaders of the Military, but they do stand behind the troops.  After all, the troops are our Sons and Daughters.  Some of the smartest people in the nation work in and with the military.  By insulting the people who are defending our freedom, Kerry has doomed himself to an eternity of nothing.",49

The former Dawson's Creek beauty, 27, sat quietly beside Cruise as he opened up about his abusive father Thomas Mapother III to Parade reporter Dotson Rader. In the Parade interview, Rader writes, ""Holmes wore a large diamond engagement ring. She seemed dazed, passive and vacant. She never stopped smiling."" Rader was stunned to notice Holmes kept smiling, even as the Top Gun star recalled the beatings he suffered as a child.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000129/news\n\nMaybe her family or friends can stage an intervention?

It was warm for a while, like back in March, and now it is cold again (like 60's and 70s). it is June it should be much warmer than this for this time of year. \nWill it ever get warm again?? Why is the weather like this? I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.  Give it a couple of days, and it'll get warmer.\n\nQuite frankly, though, I prefer weather in the 60s and 70s.  It's just about perfect.",78

9,"What qualities shoud a police officer specializing in juvenile offfenders and offenses have?

Each promotional level requires a written test and more college credits.  A Lt. must have a four year degree.  Any rank above Capt. i.e. Insp. Deputy Chief, etc. needs a Masters.  The education level is present in the NYPD but in order to work with Youth you must display the ability to deal with them.  The question is not one of education but rather the ability to separate the hardened criminals from those who are on the edge and can be turned around.

4,"If somone knows your IP address, can they access your computer and know everything? ; I am curious to know, if soemone can hack into your computer and see what you were doing either online or not online? Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?  Same situation here.  Firewalls and encryption for wireless connections are sufficient.",574
1,"in case of lizard when it loses it's tail or it's body part it grows after a short period of time..? ; how is it possible? why can't this happens 4 humans? ; Most lizards have a characteristic called autotomy: they can lose a part of their tail (usually at times of danger from predators) as a defense mechanism and it grows back (however, the regenerated structure is not exactly the same as the original tail). They cannot grow other body parts back. \nThe ability to regenerate is present in most ""lower"" (as in having simpler organization) animals, but also in some vertebrates such as fish and amphibians. The acquisition or loss of this ability has to do with the evolutionary paths of each type of organism and thus your question does not have a simple answer. At a macromolecular/genetic level, we lack some genes (or they're inactivated) that are necessary for regeneration to occur.\nSome of these genes have been identified in animals that have regenerative ability:\nhttp://pda.physorg.com/lofi-news-genes-planarian-alvarado_3953.html",588

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

Not to brag, but I'm a straight A student. I think they're just jealous. Anyway can anyone tell me why people r so cruel? ; It's because there is a lot of anger in the world. \n\nAnger has energy, as all emotions do. You can't destroy it, you can only transfer it. In many faiths, you can meditate or pray this energy be taken from you. Some even convert the energy into a great workout.

What am I to think of this man?  How?  Why?  He is well educated with a dark side.  How sad - would you say he is gay or straight or ????? ; I think you have it right: he is probably bisexual, although it is possible that he is actually gay and trying to act as straight as he can.  An awful lot of closeted gay people date women and go to female prostitutes as a way of ""proving"" that they aren't really gay.\n\nBut gay or bi (or straight with a unusual level of experimentation), I would be most concerned, if I were you, about whether he is acting out any of these fantasies.  Doctor or not, the possibilities of his contracting an STD are greatly increased if he has multiple partners, and that puts you at risk as well.  You have an absolute right to insist on exclusivity, and I think you need to make sure that he is not converting his fantasies to reality.\n\nLoving a bisexual man is not the easiest path.  But monogamy is always a conscious decision regardless of sexual orientation.  Make sure he is choosing to be only with you.  Good luck!!",797

About 6% of teen girls and 5% of college-aged females are believed to suffer from bulimia. \n\nBulimics are also susceptible to other compulsions, affective disorders, or addictions. Unlike anorexics, bulimics experience significant weight fluctuations, but their weight loss is usually not as severe or obvious as anorexics. \n\nThe secrecy of bulimia stems from the shame that bulimics often attach to the disorder. Binge eating is not triggered by intense hunger. It is a response to depression, stress, or other feelings related to body weight, shape, or food. Binge eating often brings on a feeling of calm or happiness (euphoria), but the self-loathing because of the overeating soon replaces the short-lived euphoria. \n\nOften, the individual will feel an impairment or loss of control during the binge eating and the purging becomes a way of regaining control. Not all bulimics engage in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode. Some may fast for days following a binge episode. Others may resort to excessive exercise as a method to regain their control and rid their body of the possible weight gained during the binge. Excessive exercise is that which interferes with normal daily activities or when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when it continues despite illness or injury.\n\nPatients with bulimia present a variety of medical and psychological complications which are usually considered to be reversible through a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Treatment can be managed by either a physician, psychiatrist, or in some cases, a clinical psychologist. The extent of the medical complications generally dictates the primary treatment manager. A psychiatrist, with both medical and psychological training, is perhaps the optimum treatment manager. \n\nSome patients may require hospitalization due to the extent of the medical or psychological complications. Others may seek outpatient programs. Still others may require only weekly counseling and monitoring by a practitioner. Stabilization of the patient's physical condition will be the immediate goal if the individual is in a life-threatening state. The primary goals of treatment should address both physical and psychological needs of the patient in order to restore physical health and normal eating patterns. The patient needs to identify internal feelings and distorted beliefs that led to the disorder initially. An appropriate treatment approach addresses underlying issues of control, self-perception, and family dynamics. Nutritional education and behavior management provides the patient with healthy alternatives to weight management. Group counseling or support groups can assist the patient in the recovery process as well.\n\nThe ultimate goal should be for the patient to accept herself and lead a physically and emotionally healthy life. Restoration of physical and mental health will probably take time, and results will be gradual. Patience is a vital part of the recovery process. A positive attitude coupled with much effort on the part of the affected individual is another integral component to a successful recovery.",858

2,"Something is moving below my eyelashes inside. I suspect that it is an intestinal parasite, a worm? ; Only doctor's specifically the parasitologist should answer my query please. ; It's possible.  You need to have fresh stool samples examined for ova (eggs) and parasites.  Find the lab in your area which can actually do this, and ask when they want it.  Take them a fresh sample.  And repeat this several days in a row.  One sample may not show it, and another one will.  This way you can get a diagnosis of the type of worm, and get the right medicine to take to kill them.

In a healthy individual, calcium and phosphorus have an inverse relationship, that means that when one goes up, the other goes down.

Calcium supplements should be taken 1-2 hrs after a meal to increase intestinal absorption.\nIs your low calcium-high phosphorus levels caused by an underlying condition, such as renal failure, Crohn's disease, or chronic inflammatory bowel disease?

Can a bat be swung that fast (160mph?)   If not, how fast?  Answers = greatly appreciated! ; There is no way that a human being can generate 150 mph bat speed in the 45/100ths of a second that it takes a 90 mile an hour fastball to travel from the pitcher's hand to the plate.\n\nTypical bat speeds are measured more in the 80s or 90s, but it may surprise you to know that faster bat speeds are not necessarily associated with balls that are hit for distance. In fact, the fastest bats generally belong to line drive and spray hitters like Ichiro, who can whip the bat through the zone, driving the ball on a line. Power hitters tend to use heavier bats, and consequently swing more slowly, allowing the bat to ""stay on the ball"" longer, and impart more force and impact to ""turning the ball around"".\n\nI've linked a couple of articles that discuss this - one is fairly hairy, and depends on a knowledge of physics - the other two are for general audiences, and fairly easy to understand.

Hematomas or contusions (or ""bumps"" and ""bruises"") develop when blood and scared tissue coagulates under the epidermis (top skin). \n\nHere is how to treat it:\n""For contusions (bruises), treatment consists of initially applying ice or cold packs a few times a day, to produce vasoconstriction (a reduction in arterial blood flow) which helps to decrease hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (swelling).\n\nIn general, the quicker you apply ice after the injury, the less bleeding will result.\n\nIf possible, elevate the bruised limb. Blood will leave the area of the wound and there may be less swelling. Resting the limb will also help to prevent further injury.\n\nIf the area is still painful after about 48 hours, apply gentle heat with warm towels, a hot water bottle, or a heating pad. The heat is applied for 20 minutes at a time to promote absorption and repair. Since heat causes swelling and increases tissue fluid, which may impair function, hot compresses may be followed by cold applications to minimize the secondary effects of heat.\n\nPressure in the form of an elastic adhesive bandage may be helpful to reduce hemorrhage and swelling. If infection should develop in the wound, the signs and symptoms might be increasingly severe pain, a fever of 101 degrees or more, swelling with surrounding redness, and pus. If any of these signs appear, your physician should be notified to make sure there are no additional problems.""",1180

They are independent of the states in which those reservations reside and could almost be considered as a form of even more independent state than those 50 that already exist. They have their own police forces, tribal governments, and laws. This is one reason why Indian tribes can have casinos or tobacco shops on their lands even when the state they reside in forbids gambling or charges higher tobacco taxes than the reservation does.

True Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus every day.

Any shepherd worth his salt has his sheep in a shelter and he is home in front of a good fire as winter in Israel can get very cold.\nHalloween- This one should be obvious. Christians or even JW don’t allow for the celebrating of demons. \nMother’s day and Father’s Day- This is just basics, the commandments say we should honor our Father and Mother… That means all the time not one just a special day.\nBirthday- Here is where the JW’s get a little strange; in a birthday celebration for King Herod a young girl pleases him with her dance. He gives his word that she can have anything she wanted. What she wanted was the head of john the Baptist on a platter. Herod granted this wish.

Also, there are places where your background would be great for Human Resources Department.  You might also see how you fit with marketing and so on.  A lot of it will have to do with your interests other than your degree, where your degree is just a bonus, since your degree (presumably a bachelor's) is one that is normally a preliminary to a higher degree in professions like researcher and such.  You would probably do well as a research assistant in social research, including marketing.\n\nIf I were you, I'd not write off the idea of taking a higher degree, and you could make money as a teaching assistant or junior counselor in the undergraduate program while you pursue that higher degree.

Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

Highlights (lowlights?) will include tips on invading sovereign nations based on dishonest, made up and otherwise disingenuous information. An entire wing (I believe it will be Cell Block D) will be devoted to manipulation and distortion of facts, including indepth analysis of the whole concept of ""truthiness"" (thank you, Stephen Colbert!). \n\nThe ""Dummies"" series you've alluded to in your question, planksheer, will include ""Presidenting for Dummies,"" ""Lying to Congress for Dummies,"" ""Obstructing Congress for Dummies,"" ""Lying to the American People for Dummies,"" ""Lying to the Entire Freaking World for Dummies,"" and of course the seminal ""Rummie for Dummies"" (a contribution from dubya's cellmate donald ""rummie"" rumsfeld, our nation's highest decorated nazi war criminal).\n\nI could go on about the wing (aka Cell Block C) devoted to picture books and featuring artistic exhibitions (including the commander-in-thief's own critically acclaimed -- ok, fox news acclaimed -- finger-painting collection) but that would spoil the fun. I guess we'll all just have to wait and see what other goodies are in store after the impeachments, war crimes tribunals and executions (yes, I'm afraid dr. evil cheney and piggy-man rove aren't going to quite make it to the big house, after all). \n\nAnd who ever said presidential library openings were dull? ;)",1860

When you give your heart to Jesus, you begin a personal relationship with him.\n\nIt's like if the person of your dreams asks you out.  Now you have a boyfriend (or girlfriend).  So then what do you do? Do you just call it a day? Of course not. You spend time with the person, get to know them. You also make mistakes, get into fights, and forgive one another.  All the while the relationship grows, and so does the love.  \n\nIt is the same with Jesus.  You can't just call it a day once you're saved. OK getting saved will keep you from going to hell, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you've repented and accepted His forgiveness, then you are forgiven.  But there is so much more to learn.  You can spend the rest of your life getting to know Jesus personally. The more you seek Him the more you will find Him and the more prepared you will feel. You do this by spending time with him in prayer (both speaking and listening to Him)and spending time in the word (read the bible).  Also if you don't already, find a good church to go to and good Christain friends to help you in your walk with Him.  It really is an awesome journey, but it's up to you to take the steps.\n\nBest of luck and many blessings. :)",2017

However, it's etiology (cause) is often difficult to localize.  It can be due to a number of different causes, some possibilities are: Anemia, Vitamin Deficiency, Fungal Infection, Neuropathy, Medicine induced and many other causes.  Unfortunately, about 60% of the cases are found to have no known cause (unknown etiology).  These cases are typically found in Older Women, often those who are feeling a bit depressed (often divorced or widowed, etc).  There is a belief that in these cases it has to do with the depressive state and there is actually no dental cause.  If all other causes can be rulled out, then antidepressants can be prescribed.  I'm not trying to say that this is what is causing this feeling in your mother, but I have to let you know that it is a possibility.  My suggestion is to have your mother referred to an Oral Pathologist to try to localize the cause.

9,"united states? ; What is the relationship between the United States and the peru country?  Are the two nations friends, enemies, or something in between?  Discuss ; The United States enjoys strong and cooperative relations with Peru. Relations were strained following the tainted re-election of former President Fujimori in June 2000, but improved with the installation of an interim government in November 2000 and the inauguration of the government of Alejandro Toledo in July 2001. The United States continues to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and human rights safeguards in Peru and the integration of Peru into the world economy. \nThe United States and Peru cooperate on efforts to interdict the flow of narcotics, particularly cocaine, to the United States. Bilateral programs are now in effect to reduce the flow of drugs on Peru's extensive river system and to perform ground interdiction in tandem with successful law enforcement operations. The United States is considering whether to resume cooperation on an aerial interdiction program. The United States and Peru cooperate on promoting programs of alternative development in coca-growing regions. \nU.S. investment and tourism in Peru have grown substantially in recent years. U.S. exports to Peru were valued at $3.5 billion in 2005, accounting for 30.3% of Peru's imports. In the same year, Peru exported $5 billion in goods to the United States, accounting for about 30% of Peru's exports to the world. \nAbout 200,000 U.S. citizens visit Peru annually for business, tourism, and study. About 16,000 Americans reside in Peru, and more than 400 U.S. companies are represented in the country.",2422

She mailed me back saying that I have to catch a flight ? what kind of responsbility they have? seems like they don't care about our hard work. ; Let's start with the basics: 4 out of 4 A, 3.7 out of 4 A-, 3.3 out of 4 B+, 3 of 4 is a B.

2,"Are rowing machines considered cardio or resistance? ; I've been wondering this for awhile.  On one hand you're constantly moving and it's not THAT hard, like a cardio exercise, but on the other hand you push off with your legs & pull the handle with your arms (which puts off quite a bit of resistance!)  So is a rowing machine considered cardio, resistance, or a happy medium of both? ; Both!\nAny activity that challenges your muscles at loads greater than they are accustomed to via concentric and eccentric contraction is considered resistance exercise.  The duration of the movement and energy system being used then classifies the exercise as cardiovascular or otherwise.\n\nFor example if you were to row as quickly as possible for 10 seconds or less you would primarily use the phosphagen/creatine system which provides ATP immediately to the muscle, so the energy needs are fast and powerful.\n\nIf you were to then continue rowing for 20s to 90s you would involve the glycolytic system (glucose/lactic acid) and anaerobic contributions of to ATP delivery would increase.\n\nIt's not until about 2+ min that you require a much greater oxygen utilization which would kick-in the aerobic system hence a full cardiovascular workout.\n\nSo it really does depend on how long you decide to row.  Since most people row for extends periods, it's usually classified as a cardiovascular exercise although the argument to oppose it would have to fall under the above guidelines.",2694

If all countries had an open economy, where their currencies where in a floating rate, instead of a fixed rate, supply and demand for that currency would determine its price. Lets say, mexican peso vs dollar. If today the exchange rate is $11.09 pesos for dollar and in the course of the day, international investors come and inyect more dollars to the mexican economy (stock market, funds, etc.), and that is greater than the amount of dollars that go out of the country, then people are demanding more pesos than dollars in that specific day. To put your money on mexican market, you have to do it in pesos, so what happens to your dollars? They are transformed to pesos... making the demand for peso higher than that for dollar. Exchange rate should go down... say $11.01. What determines this? Many factors. The stock market in Mexico has been booming for 2 years, so in 2005, the peso aprreciated against the dollar by almost 7%. But with the Feds moving intreset rates up, money is going to the US since it is less risky and the rates are going up, while in México rates are going down.

1,"when measuring force like pulling test it should resist a force of 14n? ; in measurung force i want to know what is the symbol n means ; N is Newtons, a unit that measures force. For every 1kg of something, if it accelerates at 1 meter per second per second (m/s/s or meters per seconds squared), than there is a force of 1N acting on it.\n\nForce is calculated by multiplying the mass (not weight) with the acceleration. For example, if you are 75kg, than there is a force of 75kg X 9.8 m/s/s (acceleration due to gravity: roughly constant on Earth) = 735N pulling you down. BUT, there is a reaction force, in this case the NORMAL, pushing you back up at the same time and force.

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

The outer segments of the photoreceptors are responsible for catching photons of light, which initiates an electochemical signal that ultimately results in vision.  There are two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in lower light levels, while cones are responsible for color and most form recognition.  Rods are dispersed throughout the retina, while cones are most densely packed in the region of the retina responsible for your central, or ""straight ahead,"" vision.  This area is called the macula.  In fact, the center of the macula, the fovea, contains only cones, and they are very densely packed in this area to allow for higher resolution of fine detail.",3785

I want to truthfully answer your question even though you have attempted to set traps. You see age is not the issue you’re attempting to make it. In some countries the life expectancy of a man is under 45 years of age and in many places in the Bible we find that men in other areas have lived in excess 500 years. Certainly life and coupling practices are different under both circumstances. So while age and culture vary the truth you seek is at what age is a given woman old enough to make life impacting decisions on her own. We see that many cultural differences answer that differently how ever being a man who loved too early and now has daughters prone to make the same bad choices, I have found truth in the area of your interest and it is this. First a child must grow enough to read and write and think deep thoughts a child should then contemplate the great depths a life could travel and the results a life could feel because of choices made. A child should realize that there is a higher power and a help in the living of that life. That child should seek first that powerful assistant and His support. Seeking that first could not possibly cause you to miss the match that would have been known to you as the perfect match. However seeking Him first guarantees that when the time is right He will bring to you the one that is meant for you. A woman should wait until God makes the match so that she doesn’t ruin the perfect union with baggage left over from youthful mistakes and indiscretions based only on the physical urges children. You know in some countries adulthood is not recognized until a person reaches their 30’s Perfection does not play worldly games and does not make sence to mankind.

9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace. Even though the outside world has bestowed upon the boys a sense of morality and order, the danger of savagery remains real even within the context of that seemingly civilized society that has nurtured them.",3923

5,"help in basketball? ; what kind of excersises can i do when i am not playing basketball or near a basketball court.. to help my left hand (im right handed, shoot with left hand, and dribble best with right hand) become better at shooting,dribbbling,layups, etc....also how can i improve ball handling skills on both and/or left and right hands? ; For dribbling, make it a point to dribble most of the time or at least give equal time to dribbling with your weak hand.  Work at dribbling the ball in figure 8's around your legs.  Dribble around cones, dribble baselines at a run getting your speed down pat.  Then dribble backing up against a defender or driving to the hoop against a defender.  If you are driving on the left side of the basket it is best to use your left hand if you can, that way your body is between the defender and the ball.  Same goes for the right side, on the right side dribble with your right hand to keep your body between the defender and the ball.  Another good thing to do when dribbling against a defender is to watch their waist, not their feet.  The waist is where the person's center of balance is.  Where their waist goes, that is where their body is going to go.  You don't necessarily have to keep your eyes on the person's waist.  You can use your free hand as your eyes.  Use your free hand to feel where the person is.  Feel whether they are moving left or moving right by placing your free hand against their waist.  Just make sure you don't use your free hand to hold them by wrapping it around them or to push off.  \n\nDon't keep your eye on the basketball, keep your eyes looking around you and on your defender.  You should be able to dribble the ball without looking at it.  So keep your head up.\n\nTo help improve your dribbling more, some coaches will have a player wear thick clumbsy gloves.  If you can get good with thick gloves on, then it makes it all that much easier when you take the gloves off.  Coaches will also use gloves for training players to catch and pass the ball.\n\nAs far as shooting, watch how much arch you give the ball.  The more arch you give the ball the better chance you have of it going in, especially if you are farther out.  Make sure to bring the ball to eye level before you shoot and keep your eyes focused on the hoop even after you let go of the ball.  When you release the ball, you want both hands to fall down like a wet limp rag.  This helps ensure that the ball doesn't stray left or right.\n\nI like to do a drill where I start out at the base of the basket 1-2 ft away and work my way out to the 3 point line.  I'll take a shot from the left side, then take a shot from the right side or work my way around the hoop in a semicircle then work my way away from the hoop.  I try taking the shots somewhat fast because you aren't going to have a lot of time to shoot them in a game.  Also this keeps you running building endurance at the same time.  By moving from short shots to long shots it helps improve both your short shots and long shots.  It also helps you gauge how much power you have to put behind your shot to hit the long shots.  If you notice you are falling short on your long shots move in a little closer if you are tired or if you aren't tired, put a little more mmph behind them.  If you are overshooting move back a little or reduce the amount of power you give it.\n\nI mentioned earlier about arch increasing your percentage of making a basket.  There is such a thing as giving too much arch to a ball.  By that I mean, the more arch you give to a ball, the more energy it requires from you to shoot it which can tire you out over the length of a game.  To accomodate that, you have to find a good middle ground for the amount of arch you give the ball.  Enough so you make the shot most the time, but not so much that it makes you tired and miss or the ball falls short.\n\nAlso, dont' be afraid to drive to the hoop, if you see the opening, go for it.  You have to be confident in your abilities.  At the same time, don't be a ball hog.  Make sure you pass the ball to players you see that could have an open shot or an open lane to drive to the hoop.  Basketball is a team sport and Bobby Knight didn't have his teams pass it 4-5 times before shooting for nothing.  Although I&#3",4101

I've seen lots of horoscope here in Yahoo Answers Horoscope section and to my surprise, Im 99 % accurate. I've told the looks of people i've never seen, details about them, their careers etc. \n\nSee, there are many things that an astrologer have to see in a horoscope. It takes years to remember those things. its a deep deep knowledge. Even the best of astrologers knows only 10 percent of total astrology.\n\none of my relatives from my brother in law side, knew when he would die, and when he died there was a chit found and it was written in it the day, and time he would die. This is fact. Astrology is Science + Maths. \n\nFor instance, there are 7 visible planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Venus, Saturn, Mercury, Jupiter) in horoscopes and 2 invisible planets (Rahu and Ketu). There are 7 splits from a sun ray when passed via a PRISM and 2 invisible rays (UV and IR). Now did you get my point ?\n\nSo, i must conclude that astrology is not fake, it's science + maths. Just provide me with ur full birth date (dd/mm/yy), birth time and birth place. i'll give you predictions at onedeepen@yahoo.com.",4128

Relationships are about two people and their feelings. For example, I have two friends that are swingers...it's totally acceptable for one to pick someone up and snog them without asking the other. They are cool with that... am I? Heck no! My point? You need to sit down with your partner and establish boundaries. They can be conservative, they can be liberal and you don't need statistics to tell you you're right. You only need to make sure it's something both of you can live with. You both must compromise on this one. For example, maybe your partner feels you are unreasonable about your level of social interaction. IE you don't like having people over enough, while he/she would love it if people were over all day long everyday. Maybe the compromise is setting up limits, like ok Monday and Wed nights are open and you can have people over but the other nights you need to ask...or maybe, as soon as you are aware someone is coming over, please let me know. Or maybe its a matter of establishing hours or something. Point is, you need to be able to find a happy medium. If you can't there might be deeper issues you need to look into resolving. Anyhow, the bottom line is the three C's: Communication, Caring and Compromise... Good luck to you!",4184

Evanescence's upcoming release, THE OPEN DOOR, will be in stores on Oct, 3. 2006!\n\nFollowing the multi-platinum, worldwide success of FALLEN, THE OPEN DOOR is an ideal showcase for the band's inevitable personal and professional growth, with songs of introspection, longing, doubt, self-respect and ultimately, empowerment and anticipation.\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles at The Record Plant with long-time friend and producer Dave Fortman, the album is defined by Amy Lee's beautiful melodies, profound lyrics, stunning vocals and poignant piano, which fuse with Terry Balsamo's urgent, yet intricate guitar playing, to form a remarkable, ethereal blend perfectly rooted in the band's rock and classical sensibilities.\n\nAmy Lee shared some thoughts about the upcoming release:\n\n""The making of this record has been really intense, but I've come out feeling purified. I've grown so much since 'Fallen,' and Terry is the perfect writing partner -- I feel like I've been lifted up to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities.

Whatever the reason, it is not always just a representation of childhood grievances; like one of the others here said, you can have a fine childhood. BUT, if you have a mental illness which can be purely organic/biological then cutting is a symptom of some pretty serious personality disorders. Either way, a cutter's suffering is great and should not be taunted because of it. Many go to great lengths to hide it and are ashamed.  If you know someone with this behavior, they need help and support soon. People who are cutters have a very high rate of suicide, although the cutting itself does not often represent a suicide attempt but some have accidentally resulted in such because they cut too deep.",4624

1,"Is there a thing called as God?I believe there a scientific explanation of everything.? ; There are no evidences and everything in world has a scientific explaination but everyone says there is God.But there really isnt and everybody wants a support and so they create an imaginary thing called as God. ; This was written as a personal email so it won't read very well.. \n\nI know you believe in science and love science. I believe in science\nand love science. And for both of us it is beyond science. It is the\npower and the beauty and the generosity and the love of nature, mother\nearth, and this world we inhabit. We believe in the gift of life given\nto us in the air we breathe, in the purity of water that purges our\nbody of toxins, in the energy of fire that gives us warmth and guides\nus in darkness, in the fascinating complexity of soil which enables\ngrasses and bushes and trees to grow and provide sustenance to the\nliving. Am I in awe of nature? It never ceases to amaze me and make me\nfeel grateful for its bounties.\n\nDo I feel the presence of God in nature? I do.  Do I believe that God\ncreated everything as a master planner or a designer who had every bit\nand every piece in his mind and who had the power to create the\nuniverse with everything that inhabits it? I don't. I believe that\nthere was a big bang in the universe. That everything was created from\na single source of matter and energy. That before the big bang time\nstood still. There was no space. There was no gravity. There was no\ntime! That there was carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and\nphosphorous after that amazing event and everything that we see around\nus and we know exists around us has come to us from these elements.\nJust like a baby in the womb starts off that single cell. And from the\nmother's body it draws food and air and grows into a wonderful living\nbreathing beautiful child. Do I believe we evolved from apes? Yes I\ndo. Do I believe that there is lightning when static electricity gets\ndischarged into the Earth? Yes I Do. And I laugh at the Hindu belief\nthat Lord Indra wields the power of lightning and rain in his hands. I\nlaugh without fear or shame that I am rebuking God.\nSo what is God for me now. I say 'now' because I also have prayed in\ndesperation to God for help or forgiveness. But I have rejected the\nidea that God is an entity who will judge me for my actions, who will\nreward me or punish me for my karma. I believe I will receive my due\nfrom the society, from my family and my friends and every life I\naffect and every life that effects my in any way. While I am alive.\nAnd when I die I will become one with the earth or water or fire or\nair. I don't care which. So who is God for me? God for me is the\nbeauty of life. The happiness that beauty brings us can never be\ndescribed by or encompassed by Science. It is God that makes me smile\nwhen a bird picks up a worm and puts it in a little bird's hungry\nbeak. Will I be able to ever explain it by science? Never! The poor\nworm died. But still there is such a power in the act of a mother\nfeeding its baby that the death of a worm is joyous. The beauty of a\nflower blooming. When I was a kid I used to sit in front of the\nevening Lily plant and watch its petals open one by one. Love and\nBeauty and the Joy they bring to us are God to me. Then God is within\nus and it is outside us. God has always existed ever since any living\nthing has existed. God is everywhere. And it is the knowledge itself.\nAnd it has the power to move every person who has God in his heart. An\nOmnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent entity. That is the definition of\nGod I feel all religions lead to. Our capacity to experience love, joy\nand beauty is God to me.\nJesus was the son of God. He did not walk on water. I will never\naccept that. Krishna was the son of God. He did not have the power to\ndisplay his stupendous universal form to Arjuna in the battlefield and\nmake him see the entire universe present inside his mouth. I will\nnever believe that there were events that happened as literally as\nthat. No miracles, no magic, no superhuman powers, no healing of the\nill and no decimation of the devils. Jesus loved humanity. His love\nempowered him to amazing peaks",4823

For $$$.\nBible edits: Over time the bible has had many chapters changed, added, omitted.\n\nhttp://flushaholybook.com ; The important things (dogma) do not change:\n+ The Church has always believed that Christ was divine\n+ The Bible has not changed since the canon was established (see below)\n\nSome traditions do change over the years as the Church is continually guided by the Holy Spirit and may continue to change:\n+ Priestly celibacy (see below)\n\nSome mistakes started by very human, incorrect, and even sometimes evil people are corrected:\n+ Indulgences for money\n\n+ The Bible + \n\nThe New Testament canon of the Catholic Bible and the Protestant Bible are the same.\n\nThe difference in the Old Testaments actually goes back to the time before and during Christ’s life. At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.\n\nThe Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities. Many of these Jews spoke only Greek.\n\nThe early Christian Church was born into this world. The Church, with its bilingual Jews and more and more Greek-speaking Gentiles, used the books of the Septuagint as its Bible. Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint. \n\nThe books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).\n\nThe Christian Church did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint.\n\n1500 years later, Protestants decided to change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon. The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.\n\nHere is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/\n\n+ The Celibate Clergy + \n\nThe celibate clergy did not come into full bloom until about 1000 A.D. There were many married priests, bishops, and popes before this time.\n\nFirst, Judeo-Christian tradition has always held that single people be celibate. This is taught by Judaism and Christianity from before the Scriptures were written down.\n\nThe question should be: Why can't priests marry?\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nA priest is ""married"" to the Church. Some people think that a priest who takes his duties seriously cannot take proper care of a wife and family. ""A man cannot ser",4992

1,"Can an antibiotic act as an antibody? ; I'm trying to answer this question comparing the disk diffusion method and animal model.  If a disk diffusion method does not show any signs of zone inhibition but the animal model does recovery from the infection, what would be the causes? ; No, antibiotics are compounds that inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria whereas antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to bind to a specific epitope such as the glycopeptides on some bacterial surfaces. Once bound, they can trigger other immune responses to kill the invading bacteria.\nThe problem with the disk diffusion method of antibiotic susceptibility testing is that it can't be a true representative of what goes on in vivo in your animal model. The test gives the bacteria ideal growth conditions with the addition of the antibiotic, but there are many more factors to take into account in the animal model. Antibodies are a good example as they will help the immune system attack the bacteria. The addition of the antibiotic in the animal probably helps keep the numbers of the bacteria down while its building an immune response to clear the infection.",5216

Unless you already have an offer pending from another work place and it is in the same kind of business as your current job. For Example..

2,"what is the analysis and interpretation of a dark amber urine? ; urinalysis ; As others have mentioned, one cause is dehydration or simply not drinking enough water. If you drink a lot of water, your urine will tend to be pale yellow. If you take a lot of vitamin C, it will be dark yellow because excess vitamin C is eliminated from your system.\n\nHowever, there may be other reasons for dark amber urine. Try drinking a few glasses of water. Don't drink too much, but a couple of bottles of water should be fine. If your urine becomes lighter, then it's probable that you simply didn't have enough clear fluid in your system.\n\nIf the urine remains dark amber, and/or if you have other symptoms, like pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, pain or tightness in your stomach, aches in your back where your kidneys are located, etc., you should see a doctor.\n\nDark amber urine may also mean you have some blood in your urine.

8,"WHAT does LOVE means IS it A true FEELING???????? ; I am agirl and iam bit confused about this ; Love is truly a feeling, but that feeling is not always truly love. this is an excerpt from an article I wrote on this subject.\n\nWhen we look at the subject of love and romance, we all come to it with our own pre-set ideas on what it means. And often this is contrary to what God says about the subject. While the Bible does not give a set pattern or prescribe a certain way of doing things, there are a number of principles found throughout the Bible, which we can take and apply to our various mindsets and preconceptions.\n\nWhat we need is a renewing of the mind through the washing of the water of the Word of God. Most of us never even think to question the way things are around us, but the truth is that when the gospel of the kingdom comes, it will clash at times with the way things are and challenge the status quo. Are we willing to stand up for what is right and say that the way things are is not the way they should be and advance the kingdom of God in our own hearts and lives? Are we willing to challenge our brothers and sisters to walk in a manner worthy of our calling as saints of the living God and not submit to the pattern of this world? (Rom. 8:29, 12:1-2) This is not something that you can be convinced of (even though it is true), but something that comes as a revelation from God. Are you willing to allow God to give you His perspective on this subject? (Pray here for the Holy Spirit to give revelation.)\n\nThis is a subject largely untouched by our Christian teachers today. And I believe one reason is that most have never thought about it deeply, and another is that people don’t really want to hear it. John 3:19-21 speaks of people who saw the light, and preferred to continue in darkness because they loved what they were doing and didn’t want to change. However, as the people who bear the very name of Christ, we must come into the light so that our deeds may be seen to be of God. In 2 Tim. 4:3-5 Paul warns Timothy that people will hire teachers who teach things that tickle the ears and don’t produce lasting change, because they don’t want to be confronted with the truth, and not to let that keep him from teaching what is true.\n\nOne of the major strongholds I see in our (Western) culture is what I have termed “Romance”. This is often mistaken for love, and is commonly made the focus of almost all our efforts in the process of determining who we want to date/marry. Dean Sherman sometimes calls this our “date-ability”. I want to give you a few little guidelines for how to tell the difference between love and romance. Please understand that this is not the dictionary definition of romance, and in the right context romance is one of the greatest of all the gifts God has given us, but I could not find any other English word that came closer to expressing the idea I want to convey. Romance (in the commonly accepted sense) is absolutely necessary for a life-long relationship, and one of the great joys that offset the sufferings of love, but you cannot build a lasting life together on romance alone. Love will develop all the good qualities of romance, while rejecting the selfish ones and in the end be more fulfilling. Love is the foundation on which romance must be built. What our culture/society teaches us, and the idea I wish to counter here, is that romance is the foundation on which to build love. I give you the divorce rate in our culture/society: More than 50% the last time I checked. This is possibly the greatest contributing factor for so many marriages failing, although there are many other factors as well. Because as we grow up, we are taught (sometimes unconsciously) that romance should be the primary motivator, and in some cases we come to believe that it’s the only motivator; but romance will simply fade away if it’s not built on the solid foundation of love. Developing romance before love can actually hinder the development of love. \n\nBefore going any further, let me give you my definiti",5561

With o/d protection, if you overdraw, they will automatically pay the check, then start a credit line.  They will likely charge a $1 or $2 fee for each event.

6,"How to program a vending maching for foreign currencies? ; I wonder how I can set up vendind machines so that they can accept currencies other than americans coins or bills ; There would be two problems - getting readers that count the foreign currency, and getting up-to-date conversion rates sent to it, so that you con't get cheated by currency rates changing.\n\nYou'd have to set it up so that it either gets an update once per day, say, or like an ATM, it would 'phone home' for every transaction to verify rates.  A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.  It would be cool to select an item and just start feeding in all those different currencies until the item is paid for, and it spits out change in Dollars or something.  This would make displaying prices difficult, since you are using several currencies to pay for an item, but this would be a valuable thing to have in airports around the world.\n\nInteresting idea.",5917

From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars.

His SED rate is still 120 after about 5 weeks. What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about. Yes blood work is getting done to make sure his van levels are ok. Can not re-culture the site of infection. It was or is in his back, they will be taking out the staples tomorrow. So the wound will be closed up. I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone. He feels good no apparent sign of infection. Red cells are a little low, white cells are good. His iron is down. Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.",6548

And a power source for all those parts requiring an electrical impulse.  \nThe procedures used usually try to remove power from the overall device, if that is not possible, try to prevent the electrical impulse from making it to the trigger or detonator.

3,"Who is nalson mandela? ; i need info byt the second of may ; Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was Chief Henry Mandela of the Tembu Tribe. Mandela himself was educated at University College of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand and qualified in law in 1942. He joined the African National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against the ruling National Party's apartheid policies after 1948. He went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was acquitted in 1961.\n\nAfter the banning of the ANC in 1960, Nelson Mandela argued for the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. In June 1961, the ANC executive considered his proposal on the use of violent tactics and agreed that those members who wished to involve themselves in Mandela's campaign would not be stopped from doing so by the ANC. This led to the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with hard labour. In 1963, when many fellow leaders of the ANC and the Umkhonto we Sizwe were arrested, Mandela was brought to stand trial with them for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. His statement from the dock received considerable international publicity. On June 12, 1964, eight of the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor Prison, nearby on the mainland.\n\nDuring his years in prison, Nelson Mandela's reputation grew steadily. He was widely accepted as the most significant black leader in South Africa and became a potent symbol of resistance as the anti-apartheid movement gathered strength. He consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom.\n\nNelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. After his release, he plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life's work, striving to attain the goals he and others had set out almost four decades earlier. In 1991, at the first national conference of the ANC held inside South Africa after the organization had been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected President of the ANC while his lifelong friend and colleague, Oliver Tambo, became the organisation's National Chairperson.",6849
0,"Do you think this helps to prove the point Jehovas Witness are a cult? ; When you study with the Jehovah's Witness, you agree to attend five meetings a week where you are taught from Watchtower literature.  You cannot be baptized until you have studied their material for at least six months and have answered numerous questions before a panel of elders.   Men are not supposed have long hair or wear beards and women are to dress in modest apparel.  They refuse to vote, salute the flag, sing the ""Star Spangled Banner, celebrate birthdays or Christmas, won't take blood transfusions, and they can't join the armed forces.  A schedule of door-to-door canvassing is required where you distribute the Watchtower literature, acquire donations, and forward all monies to the headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.\n     If you ever leave the Jehovah's Witness organization, you are considered an apostate and are to be shunned. ; groups like the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses object to the label ""cult"" because it often gets an emotional reaction as well as is a label they want to avoid.\n   The definition I use (and other Christian ministries and theologians use as well) for ""non-Christian cult"" or ""non-Christian religion"" is a group that may or may not include the Bible in its set of authoritative scriptures. If it does include the Bible, it distorts the true biblical doctrines that effect salvation sufficiently so as to void salvation.1  If it doesn't use the Bible, it is a non-Christian religion and does not participate in the benefit of divine revelation.\n     In Christian bookstores, there are almost always 'cult' sections which include the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.",6853

Something powerful enough to plant the tiniest seed to grow all of life from. Am I missing some information? ; I think your on the right track my friend, but just expand your thinking a little bit on this subject. One of the most interesting theories I've heard about this subject comes from a book ""Stalking the Wild Pendulum""- (written by a self taught Astrophysicist!)It asserts that where there is matter there is consciousness and where there is consciousness there is an aspect of ""God""  Rather then God having a self encapsulated ego, god can be thought of all that is and all that is not.  This is often referred to as the ""god head"" or the ""Prime Mover.""  There may be some unification between the belief in God and in Evolution.  ""God"" emerged from the void realized ""Himself"" through ""His"" creation and then returned to the void.\nIn terms of your question regarding Homo Sapiens- our predecessors didn't evolve from the apes- although prehistoric man was ""ape-like""  Homo Erectus started to use tools to break open bones for the fat rich marrow inside to feed a very large and developing brain.  Apparently big brains require lots of energy!  The brain of our strain of primates distinguished themselves by all that Grey matter up there, unlike our ""ape"" cousins.",6902

Legislation is suppossed to be done entirely by the Congress. ; This problem started back during the first term of the F.D.R. Administration. F.D.R. was attempting to push through his ""New Deal"" legislation and the Supreme Court was striking down pieces of legislation left and right because they were not within the enumerated powers of the federal goverment.\n\nF.D.R.'s solution to this little problem was to threaten to pack the court with justices who would vote the way he wanted. Back then there was no constitutionally stipulated maximum to the number of justices that could be put on the court so long as the president nominated them and the Senate gave their consent.\n\nWith this very real threat in place, the High Court backed down, and ever since we have essentially had no limit on the powers of the federal government.\n\nThis is the single greatest threat to our country.

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Prolactin production is stimulated by the infant suckling.  \nOxytocin is also a hormone that plays a role in lactation.  Just as prolactin is stimulated by infant suckling, so is oxytocin.  As the infant suckles, the posterior pituary is triggered to produce oxytocin.  Oxytocin is responsible for the milk ejection reflex.

4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

1,"How to tell which compound would likely dissolve in water or gasoline? ; I have a quick question and would like some tips as to how to tell a compound as to whether it would dissolve more in water or gasoline. Such as Choloroform(CHCl3), Na2SO4, KCl, and BaSo4\n\nI would greatly appreciate anyone's help with this! ; We've to get this clear first. Water is a polar solvent, gasoline is a non-polar solvent. By the principal of like-dissolves-like, polar molecules will dissolve in water, for example, NaCl; while non-polar molecules will dissolve in gasoline, for example, fats, phosholipids, alkanes, alkenes etc.\n\nFor the question you've asked,\nChloroform is a polar compund because Cl draws electrons from the carbon center and making Cl atoms have a higher concerntration of electrons. Hydrogen atoms in water carry a partially positive charge and hence are attracted to Cl molecule. Hence it is soluble in water.\n\nNa2SO4 is soluble in water. This is because it is actually 2 Na+ ions attached to SO4(2-) ions. Na+ ions get attracted to oxygen atoms in water which has a partially negative charge and SO4(2-) ions gets attracted to hydrogen atoms in water which has a partially positive charge.\n\nKCL is soluble in water because Cl atoms draws electrons from K. Follow the same reasoning as chloroform.\n\nFor BaSO4, it is insoluble in water. Only barium nitrate dissolves in water. Other barium salts do not.\n\nHope this helps! =)",7637

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity. This is it.",8397

9,"British/American Politics? ; In Britain the Tory Party represents Big Business, the Labour Party says it represents the People(Debatable) And the Liberals can't make there minds up, what's the equivalent in America?. ; Good question. Anerican politics can be very complicated.\n\nGenerally, the Republican Party can be seen as the equivalent to the ""Tories"", the Democratic Party can be seen as the equivalent to Labour, although the American spectrum is a little bit more to the right. From what I've heard about the modern Liberal party, they are probably equivalent to Libertarians- although it's hard to peg your Liberal party down on the political spectrum.\n\nBut until the 1960's, it wasn't that cut and dry. The Democrats had many Conservatives in the south and elsewhere. And the Republicans had many liberals/moderates in the Northeast. The Republicans, after all, were the ones who freed the slaves during the Civil War. The Democrats, as a matter of fact, encouraged the formation of the KKK as a means of intimidating republicans(most of the Republicans in the south after the civil war were black ).\n\nBut even with those contradictions, the Democrats have almost always been perceived as more of ""the people's party"" and the Republicans have been more of a ""Pro-Business"" party.\n\nAs I said, the 60's and the Nixon ""Southern Strategy"" sort of caused a realignment. Conservatives moved to the GOP(Republican party) and liberals moved to the Democrats- although the seeds of this were already in each party, and there had been a slow drift both ways throughout the 20th century.",8446

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602
1,"what is ""maxwell's deamon""? ; it may be related to James Clerk Maxwell or physics (perhaps electromagnetism) ; Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment. Take a room full of ordinary air at a temperature of, say, 300 kelvin. Now, 300 kelvin means that the molecules of the air are moving with a certain speed - the faster they move, the hotter it is. Well, not all molecules in the room are moving with the same speed. Some of them are faster (""hotter"") and some are slower (""colder""). What Maxwell's demon is apparently capable of doing is sort all the fast molecules into one end of the room and all the slow ones into the other end, thus making an oven in one end and a freezer in the other! What Maxwell's point about this is that this can't be done without expending more energy than is gained by this ordering of thermal energy. In other, more precise, words, the entropy cannot decrease.",8605

3,"What were 3 main causes of the civil war?? ; I have a test tomorrow in social studies! ; The Civil War was caused by a myriad of conflicting pressures, principles, and prejudices, fueled by sectional differences and pride, and set into motion by a most unlikely set of political events.\n\nAt the root of all of the problems was the institution of slavery, which had been introduced into North America in early colonial times. The American Revolution had been fought to validate the idea that all men were created equal, yet slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies throughout the revolutionary period. Although it was largely gone from the northern states by 1787, it was still enshrined in the new Constitution of the United States, not only at the behest of the Southern ones, but also with the approval of many of the Northern delegates who saw that there was still much money to be made in the slave trade by the Yankee shipping industry. Eventually its existence came to color every aspect of American life.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention there were arguments over slavery. Representatives of the Northern states claimed that if the Southern slaves were mere property, then they should not be counted toward voting representation in Congress. Southerners, placed in the difficult position of trying to argue, at least in this case, that the slaves were human beings, eventually came to accept the three-fifths compromise, by which five slaves counted as three free men toward that representation. By the end of the convention the institution of slavery itself, though never specifically mentioned, was well protected within the body of the Constitution.\n\nIt seemed to Thomas Jefferson and many others that slavery was on its way out, doomed to die a natural death. It was becoming increasingly expensive to keep slaves in the agrarian society of the south. Northern and Southern members of Congress voted together to abolish the importation of slaves from overseas in 1808, but the domestic slave trade continued to flourish. The invention of the cotton gin made the cultivation of cotton on large plantations using slave labor a profitable enterprise in the deep South. The slave became an ever more important element of the southern economy, and so the debate about slavery, for the southerner, gradually evolved into an economically based question of money and power, and ceased to be a theoretical or ideological issue at all. It became an institution that southerners felt bound to protect.\n\nBut even as the need to protect it grew, the ability, or at least the perceived ability of the South to do so was waning. Southern leaders grew progressively more sensitive to this condition. In 1800 half of the population of the United States had lived in the South. But by 1850 only a third lived there and the disparity continued to widen. While northern industrial opportunity attracted scores of immigrants from Europe in search of freedom the South's population stagnated. Even as slave states were added to the Union to balance the number of free ones, the South found that its representatives in the House had been overwhelmed by the North’s explosive growth. More and more emphasis was now placed on maintaining parity in the Senate. Failing this, the paranoid theory went, the South would find itself at the mercy of a government in which it no longer had an effective voice. Never mind that slavery was protected under the constitution, and that it would have been impossible to make amendments to abolish it. Jefferson Davis, at the time a Senator from Mississippi, summed up the sectionalist argument himself. Speaking, in effect, to the people of the North concerning slavery, “It is not humanity that influences you… it is that you may have a majority in the Congress of the United States and convert the Government into an engine of Northern aggrandizement… you want by an unjust system of legislation to promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.” There, in plain English, is the shrill, accusat",8670

Are you asking if somone could get into more trouble than normal for not paying their debt when it's in the hundereds of thousands, verus let's say someone with only a few thousands dollars debt?\n\nDebt is debt is debt.  If you take out a credit card, no matter what your credit limit is, you're supposed to pay it back according to the terms of the credit card company.  If you don't, the credit card company has a couple of different options.  For a small amount, they could simply write the debt off on their taxes at the end of the year and forget it.  Or, they could sell the debt to someone else, and the someone else could try to collect it (phone calls, letters, etc).  In either case, it's probably going to show up on your credit report, and your credit would suffer the normal 7 years.  In some cases, these ""debt buyers"" post the debt as of the day they buy it, and it could stay on your credit for alot longer than just 7 years.\n\nThe credit card company could also take you to small claims court (depending on how much you owe and what the limit for your state is) and get a judgment.  Here's where things get tricky.  If the credit card company wins in small claims, they could (1) take money out of your bank account (2) garnish your wages (3) they could take any of your personal property that isn't considered ""exempt"" in your state (car, RV, motorcycle, etc) or (4) if there's enough debt, they could call for a foreclosure on your home.

1,"can anyone tell me how to do the add math project work about the aluminium cans? ; a company is manufacturer of cylindrical aluminium tins.The manager plans to reduce the cost of production.The production cost is proportional to the area of the aluminium sheet used.the volume that each tin can hold is 1000cm3.i hope sumone who have done this kind of project can help me.If possible i would like to know every inch of it including the conjecture and heuristic.. ; Difficult without paper, but the principle is to work out a formula for the total area of aluminium sheet which still maintaining 1000cm3 volume.\n\nIn the following, r = radius of cylinder and h = height of can.\n\nArea of aluminium = 2*pi*r^2 [the top and bottom] + 2*pi*r*h [because 2*pi*r is the circumference of the can]\n\nBecause pi*r^2*h = 1000, you can substitute h = 1000/pi*r^2 into the Area equation.\n\nThen differentiate with respect to r, and when dA/dr = 0, that's the most economical way to make the can.\n\nIt should turn out at close to r = 5.4; h = 10.9",8874
6,"CAPM in China? ; Hello,\nIm writing a paper why the CAPM doesn`t work in CHina. I need a mathematical example with the simple CAPM-equation to show it. I don`t know what I should use as the riskfree rate. So my question is whar should I use and do you know a good example or other reasons why it doesnt work? ; First of all the extension of the original CAPM(Sharpe, Mossin,\nLintner in 1963) is termed the International CAPM or ICAPM.\nTo use it in china you need a beta for the stock or for a portolio of \nstocks which will be difficult for some of the newly formed \nChinese publically traded corporations.  Another factor is the\nstock market in China is an emerging market hence it suffers from a general lack of history and liquidity though expectation is that it will grow rapidly in the future.  \n\nThe model would be:R stock = risk free rate+Beta (Rmarket-RF)\n\n  Now in the literature it is common to use either the \nU.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the U.S. Long Bond Rate. As \nRoll's critique aptly pointed out there is no truely riskless asset\nso we have used the above surrogates. Not a bad choice though since the data on them is readily available through the U.S. \nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which issues these debt \nobligations through the Fed has never defaulted on any obligations.  Further the marke is the largest most liquid debt \nmarket in the world which has investors from around the world and foreign governments buying and selling these assets \ncontinuously.   \n\nSo, next we address the matter of a market index surrogate\nto use in the right hand terms.  Since we can't really use the \nChinese swtock market Index as a true surrogate for the \nworld market index we must make one.  Assuming there is \nadequate capital market integration today to allow us to do so.\nIn the literature some have use a weighted average composite\nconsisting ofweights determined by the relative market values \nof equity traded on the diverse major wold bourses(Stock Markets).  For example the portion of equity traded in the NY\nStock market weighted by an index like the S& P 500 index\nalong with the proportion of stocks traded in London weighted \nby the FTS Index.  Gradually if you consider all the major \nmarkets today such as Tokyo, Paris, London, New York,\nCanada TSE, etc.,\nyou'll be able to compute a suitable weighted average \nRORmrkt. \n\nThe major problem you need to ovwercome in any emerging market like China is thin market trading--translation too few stocks are quoted and trading activity in them takwes too long to \nprovide investors /money managers with enough information\nderived from each successive buy-sell combination). \n\n\n  Assuming you did find an adequately traded stock with enough \nhistory in the Chinese stock market, and you did compute a \nworld market index surrogate for the market index along \nwith selecting a risk free asset such as by using the U.S. \nT Bill Yield, then you could use the equation to correctly \nprice the Chinese stock in terms of its rate of return.\n\nAssume further that you average the returns on the world market\nindexes and it turns out to be 12%.\n\nNext regress the Chinese stock past returns (having converted from Yen capital gains and dividends) againtst the historical \nworld market stock index levels for the same number of observations as you have on the Chinese stock (note: the data \nmust be aligned so that they are matched for the same time periods as those of the Chinese stock'sprice observations. \nIn other words the matched pairs must be contemperaneous with one another. You should use say weekly, monthly close \ndata and with the problem I described earlier I would use the \nlater time interval for obserfvations.  \n\nThe coefficient of this OLS simple regression is the Beta\non the stock.  Assume it is 1.5 positive.\n\n    If we assume a yield on the U.S. T Bill of 5%, the math \nthen is  Stock ROR% = 5% + 1.5(10%-5%) = 5%+7.5%= 12%\n\nThere's the heart of your paper...now gety busy and write it.\n\nTry doing a dogpile or other search for academic journal, textbooks on international finance, and other sources.",8877

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

If it has a rifled barrel it will not shoot shot very well but it will do it, the shot will just spread out more.  If it has a tight chook you should not shoot steel shot or unrifled slugs in it as it damage the chook.

In a smooth bore barrel with a cylinder bore or modified chook you can shoot all  you cam shoot all types of shot un less the barrel says “Lead shot only”.  It is very simple to change barrels on a 500 all you do is make sure the shot gun is unloaded {check to make sure it is unloaded 3 times before doing any thing}.

Anyways, here you go...\n\n\n Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter\n    Uploaded on Jun 3, 2005  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nEffects of Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter \n\nEach society in the world is unique, and each has its own values and beliefs. Throughout time, societies have shaped the way that man lives. This includes not only his actions, but it also includes his thoughts and feelings. In many instances, such as in Puritan societies, religion plays the most important role. The Crucible by Arthur Miller and The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne are stories which vividly demonstrate the effect society has on people. The Puritan society that is created in each of these stories acts as the driving force to their plots. \nIn The Crucible, the entire plot is molded by the morals of the Puritan society. The superstition that many Puritans believed in is represented through Reverend Parris. He insists to Abigail that “if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Miller 10). Parris was not only concerned about the witches, but was terrified that his reputation will be ruined as well. This example also leads to another aspect of Puritan society that affected the plot. The Puritan people were very closely knit, meaning that everyone knew everyone else, and consequently, rumors spread quickly. This was why Reverend Parris needed to know “Who? Who? Their names, their names!” (Miller 44), so he could find someone to blame for the madness. The fear of witchcraft was so strong that even the decent Reverend John Hale, who was the most open minded of the characters, worried about its effect. He even had books in which there “…is all the invisible world, caught, defined, and calculated…the Devil stands stripped of all his brute disguises…we shall find him out if he has come among us…” (Miller 37). Another attitude of Puritan society that shapes this play is the fear of God. This fear is seen everywhere and it goes hand in hand with the idea of superstition. \nReverend Hale tells Tituba, “You are God’s instrument…face God- face God, Tituba, and God will protect you” (Miller 44), exhibiting the great trust that the people hold in God and how their actions are all in the name of him. This story would not exist without the God-fearing mindset of the Puritan people. John Proctor is no exception to this theme. He has a moral dilemma in which he states, “…I wilted, and, like a Christian, I confessed. Confessed!…Let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not!” (Miller 52). Even though he did not seem like the most religious man in the story, he remains loyal to his strong morals because of the society around him. The Puritan society in The Crucible was what let the story make sense. \nThe Scarlet Letter is another story that relies on the values of the Puritans and their society. The idea of harsh punishment for sins was the broadest of these values. Hester Prynne was punished with public humiliation and “with only that one ornament, -the scarlet letter,- which it was her doom to we",9830

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

2,"detox diet?? ; Has anyone heard of a detox diet? If so what are some of your views on it? ; Right now there are several diets being called the detox diet, so I am not sure if you mean the one with maple syrup or not.\nIf it is the one with maple syrup---forget it. It's not healthy.\n\nYou are much better off visiting your local health food store (or GNC or Costco) . On their shelves you will see several variations of detoxing diets. There is one where you take 2 capsules a night for 30 nights. It's a slow detox but it does work. There is also one that works over 14 days.\n\nIf you are new at detoxing you will find yourself with very unpleasant side effects. Like: flu symptoms, coughing, fever, tiredness, being cranky, dizzy and several more. \n\nThat is why the slow detox is best to start out with. It slowly detoxes the system so you don't notice the side effects.\n\nOnce you detox slowly, then you can detox more agressively.\n\nThe first time I detoxed, I started with the 30 days, then went to the 14 days, now when I do a 2 day fast/detox there are no unpleasant side effects.",9949
