0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

9,"Can John Kerry keep his freaking mouth shut, a week before the election? ; I don't think his remark will hurt the democrats in the election, most people already have their minds made up.  But he is probably done with any future national office! ; I think he really screwed up here.  What he did is a career ender, no matter what party it came from.  Lets face it, the Republicans weren't/aren't doing much to help their standing, but thanks to Mr. Kerry (which he will remain, Mr. that is) they didn't need to.  Now they need to run with it.  \n\nAlso, this thing with Kerry refusing to appologize to the troops and the military, I guess he wants to take the express train out D.C.  I didn't vote for him to 2004, and if he thinkns that he's going to get any votes in 2008, he's nuts!!  The military is one of those things that you just don't mess with.  The American People may not stand behind the leaders of the Military, but they do stand behind the troops.  After all, the troops are our Sons and Daughters.  Some of the smartest people in the nation work in and with the military.  By insulting the people who are defending our freedom, Kerry has doomed himself to an eternity of nothing.",49

So, Kate it is.\n\nHolmes' 'Passive' Behavior Stuns Interviewer\n7 April 2006 (WENN)\nPregnant actress Katie Holmes stunned a magazine journalist when she accompanied fiance Tom Cruise on a recent interview, by acting in a ""dazed, passive and vacant"" manner. The former Dawson's Creek beauty, 27, sat quietly beside Cruise as he opened up about his abusive father Thomas Mapother III to Parade reporter Dotson Rader. In the Parade interview, Rader writes, ""Holmes wore a large diamond engagement ring. She seemed dazed, passive and vacant. She never stopped smiling.""

9,"what is the root of the fight between Israel and Palestine? ; I watch the movie Munich directed by Steven Spielberg.Based on the true events. 11 Israeli athletes were held hostage and killed by terrorists during the 1972 olympics. ; Dear derekmleiniger,\n\nYour analogy is totally wrong. Unlike English and other establishers of USA, Israelis started to kill the Palestinians grabbing their land and not ready to give any rights to them. The only reason that Palestinians are facing hard time is that they don't have any port and can't do business activities independently. \n\nWhile only reason Israelis look flourishing is the aid sent by the oversees Jews as well as hefty amount of $ 3 billion from US only.\n\nFollowing is an account of Israel's leaders, you can find it very different compares to people who came to US:\n\n\n\n""We must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation, and the cutting of all social services to rid the Galilee of its Arab population.""\n-- David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff.

1,"weather question? ; Why has it been so cold in the Northeast?? It was warm for a while, like back in March, and now it is cold again (like 60's and 70s). it is June it should be much warmer than this for this time of year. \nWill it ever get warm again?? Why is the weather like this? I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.  Give it a couple of days, and it'll get warmer.\n\nQuite frankly, though, I prefer weather in the 60s and 70s.  It's just about perfect.",78

Before I put him on the diet (he was almost 3) he would be even MORE hyper after eating foods with milk, and would have these crazy laughing spells.

Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?

They cannot grow other body parts back. \nThe ability to regenerate is present in most ""lower"" (as in having simpler organization) animals, but also in some vertebrates such as fish and amphibians. The acquisition or loss of this ability has to do with the evolutionary paths of each type of organism and thus your question does not have a simple answer.

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

Not to brag, but I'm a straight A student. I think they're just jealous. Anyway can anyone tell me why people r so cruel? ; It's because there is a lot of anger in the world. \n\nAnger has energy, as all emotions do. You can't destroy it, you can only transfer it. In many faiths, you can meditate or pray this energy be taken from you. Some even convert the energy into a great workout. Yet still, there are those who have no faith, or workout routine, transfer their angry energy to others- thus keeping the cycle of bad energy going. \n\nIf you can't change something, change the way you feel about it.",725

What am I to think of this man?  How?  Why?  He is well educated with a dark side.  How sad - would you say he is gay or straight or ????? ; I think you have it right: he is probably bisexual, although it is possible that he is actually gay and trying to act as straight as he can.  An awful lot of closeted gay people date women and go to female prostitutes as a way of ""proving"" that they aren't really gay.\n\nBut gay or bi (or straight with a unusual level of experimentation), I would be most concerned, if I were you, about whether he is acting out any of these fantasies.  Doctor or not, the possibilities of his contracting an STD are greatly increased if he has multiple partners, and that puts you at risk as well.  You have an absolute right to insist on exclusivity, and I think you need to make sure that he is not converting his fantasies to reality.\n\nLoving a bisexual man is not the easiest path.  But monogamy is always a conscious decision regardless of sexual orientation.  Make sure he is choosing to be only with you.  Good luck!!",797

About 6% of teen girls and 5% of college-aged females are believed to suffer from bulimia. \n\nBulimics are also susceptible to other compulsions, affective disorders, or addictions. Unlike anorexics, bulimics experience significant weight fluctuations, but their weight loss is usually not as severe or obvious as anorexics. \n\nThe secrecy of bulimia stems from the shame that bulimics often attach to the disorder. Binge eating is not triggered by intense hunger. It is a response to depression, stress, or other feelings related to body weight, shape, or food. Binge eating often brings on a feeling of calm or happiness (euphoria), but the self-loathing because of the overeating soon replaces the short-lived euphoria. \n\nOften, the individual will feel an impairment or loss of control during the binge eating and the purging becomes a way of regaining control. Not all bulimics engage in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode. Some may fast for days following a binge episode. Others may resort to excessive exercise as a method to regain their control and rid their body of the possible weight gained during the binge. Excessive exercise is that which interferes with normal daily activities or when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when it continues despite illness or injury.\n\nPatients with bulimia present a variety of medical and psychological complications which are usually considered to be reversible through a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Treatment can be managed by either a physician, psychiatrist, or in some cases, a clinical psychologist. The extent of the medical complications generally dictates the primary treatment manager. A psychiatrist, with both medical and psychological training, is perhaps the optimum treatment manager. \n\nSome patients may require hospitalization due to the extent of the medical or psychological complications. Others may seek outpatient programs. Still others may require only weekly counseling and monitoring by a practitioner. Stabilization of the patient's physical condition will be the immediate goal if the individual is in a life-threatening state. The primary goals of treatment should address both physical and psychological needs of the patient in order to restore physical health and normal eating patterns. The patient needs to identify internal feelings and distorted beliefs that led to the disorder initially. An appropriate treatment approach addresses underlying issues of control, self-perception, and family dynamics. Nutritional education and behavior management provides the patient with healthy alternatives to weight management. Group counseling or support groups can assist the patient in the recovery process as well.\n\nThe ultimate goal should be for the patient to accept herself and lead a physically and emotionally healthy life. Restoration of physical and mental health will probably take time, and results will be gradual. Patience is a vital part of the recovery process. A positive attitude coupled with much effort on the part of the affected individual is another integral component to a successful recovery.",858

People's excuse was that they would want to know, they wouldn't want their child to go have an abortion without them knowing... and that's all well and good for the stable households, but there are girls out there that can not tell their parents.. they have that dad that's going to smack her around and throw her out the door... not all young girls lead good lives with their parents.. some parents are extremely abusive and mentally unstable",932

1,"whats -16x squared + 80x + 3? ; i think u have to solve it by binomiels but i cant think of 2 numbers that multiple to 16 and add to 80. its a parabala and i have to graph it please help ; y = -16x^2 +80x +3\n\nFirst of all, it is a negative quadratic function, so, you expect this quadratic function to open downwards. Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943
6,"i need advice on how to make money on real estate buy remodel and sell? ; i have 10 + years carpentery exp drywall painting hardwood floor install sand finish ; Remember you only make money when you BUY a property, not when you sell it.  That means that you have to ""make"" your money when you buy the house.  Make sure you have enough equity in the house upfront to:\n\n1.  Repair the house for sale.  This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950
2,"Mirena or Paraguard? Which is more healthy? Are there significant amounts of hormones in the Mirena IUD? ; I have had problems with the Pill's hormones and having migranes. I went off the Pill and now I don't experience the migraines I used to. I want to get an IUD but don't know which one would be best for my health. Do the hormones in the Mirena IUD cause migraines in anyone? I know that Mirena is the most effective, I just don't want to suffer with migraines because of it. Advice please. ; Mirena IUD:\nHow it works:  It is inserted into the uterus and is about the size of a quarter.  Mirena contains a type of progestin called levonorgestrel, which blocks sperm and alters the lining of the uterus, interrupting implantation of a fertilized egg.  Modern IUD's don't pose a high risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.  In fact, the hormone in Mirena helps shrink uterine fibroids, decreases menstrual cramping, can reduce blood loss by 97% and may lower your risk of endometrial cancer. If the birth control pill you were taking contained levonorgestrel then you might get migraines from the IUD, but it is unlikely since you are not ingesting the hormone.  It provides protection for 5 years.\n\nParagard IUD:\nHow it works: It is inserted the same way as Mirena, but it works differently; instead of hormones, Paragard contains copper, which kills sperm.  It provides protection for 10 years. Research shows that Paragard may lower your risk of developing endometrial cancers, though experts aren't sure why.  \n\nThere is also an an implant that is not yet available, but will be soon, called Implanon.  A single matchsticklike implant is inserted into your upper arm.  The implant, which should be approved by the FDA this year, releases a low dose of Progestin into your body. It blocks ovulation and thickens cervical mucus so the sperm cannot enter for up to three years.  It is 100% effective, whereas the Paragard and Mirena is only 99% and 99.9% effective.",965

When sexual abuse happens a person's sense of themselves, esteem, their understanding of healthy boundaries are completely screwed up.  This is why THERAPY is SO important.  You cannot blame yourself for what happened with your father.  Your need to want to do anything to keep him comes as a product of your earlier abuse.  The line between appropriate and inappropriate - and being able to say NO - got lost when it happened to you earlier.  Generally people who go on for years without help will find themselves in positions where they are taken advantage of (and allow that to happen - because they don't realize it at the time) and until you get the help - this will continue to happen.  \n\nShame is a huge piece of this.

There are many support groups that are free, and counselling offered - talk to friends - your doctor - look in the phone book and call up different places.  Ask lots of questions. In the meantime you can't change what happened with your father - you made a mistake - but YOU are NOT a mistake.  Stop being hard on yourself.

Hematomas or contusions (or ""bumps"" and ""bruises"") develop when blood and scared tissue coagulates under the epidermis (top skin). \n\nHere is how to treat it:\n""For contusions (bruises), treatment consists of initially applying ice or cold packs a few times a day, to produce vasoconstriction (a reduction in arterial blood flow) which helps to decrease hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (swelling).\n\nIn general, the quicker you apply ice after the injury, the less bleeding will result.\n\nIf possible, elevate the bruised limb. Blood will leave the area of the wound and there may be less swelling. Resting the limb will also help to prevent further injury.\n\nIf the area is still painful after about 48 hours, apply gentle heat with warm towels, a hot water bottle, or a heating pad. The heat is applied for 20 minutes at a time to promote absorption and repair. Since heat causes swelling and increases tissue fluid, which may impair function, hot compresses may be followed by cold applications to minimize the secondary effects of heat.\n\nPressure in the form of an elastic adhesive bandage may be helpful to reduce hemorrhage and swelling. If infection should develop in the wound, the signs and symptoms might be increasingly severe pain, a fever of 101 degrees or more, swelling with surrounding redness, and pus. If any of these signs appear, your physician should be notified to make sure there are no additional problems.""",1180

Blood in your stool/urine is NOT a normal occurrence. Now, that said, if I were very consitpated, and passed a large bowel and saw blood, I would probably assume it was a simple tear. However, if I saw blood again, I'd get medical advice.\n\nAnd with most things, the earlier it's detected, the EASIER and BETTER the treatment can be.\n\nIt may be something simple, such as small rips and tears during the bowel passing thru your anus, or it may be something more in-depth.\n\nWhatever the case, go see a doctor ASAP. S/he will treat you in a professonal manner and will make it as pain-free as possible.\n\nThe best of luck!",1186

1,"Can you tell me interesting facts about an electric drill??? ; My 10 years old daughter wants to know more about the electric drill. ; Yes, what the others aswerers said is true, but if you really want interesting things to find out  you should look to the masonry drilling bits, because they work on totally different principle than normal drill bits (for wood, metal and so on).\n\nThe masonry doesn't behave like all other materials, meaning that's not plastic (it does not deform and remain deformed after that, but is a very little bit elastic), and also IS fragile , meaning that is cracking if the critical tension has been reached. Also is not homogeneous like other materials (actually is a composite material, made from pebbles, stones and cement in water).\nThat's why the drill bits for this kind of things act exactly like rotating chisel. It has an leading edge hat is acting axial (along the axis of the drilling bit) and the bit is made from the most strongest carbides (VC, TiC, WC, etc mixed with the metallic powder techniques).\nThat's only because a drill bit  made for wood/metal would be destroyed at the very first millimeters. \n\nIt's acting by hitting then rotating few degrees and then hitting again and so on (that's why I called it ""rotating chisel"" and its bit is acting along the axis of the drilling rod).\nThe metal/wood drilling bits are acting like knifes which are ""shaving"" the face of the material bit by bit, actually making a spiral (a continuous chip) with the chips no thicker than 1 millimeter, no matter the size of the drilling bits. In the same way the masonry drilling bits are not fitted to drill wood/metal.\n\nDfriend:)",1213

9,"Native Americans have a seperate nation but they can still vote and are citizens of US, right? ; I was just wondering. ; Native American nations have been considered soveriegn, but ""dependent"" nations within the United States since the administration of President Andrew Jackson. This little bit of legal skullduggery means that Indian reservations are technically sovereign land belonging to the Indian nations that own them, but are still dependent upon the federal government for all interactions outside the reservation. They are independent of the states in which those reservations reside and could almost be considered as a form of even more independent state than those 50 that already exist. They have their own police forces, tribal governments, and laws. This is one reason why Indian tribes can have casinos or tobacco shops on their lands even when the state they reside in forbids gambling or charges higher tobacco taxes than the reservation does. Yet, American Indians are basically dual citizens--of both their Indian nation and the United States--and are required to carry out the duties, rights and responsiblities of both communities; including the right to vote in local, state and federal elections.",1238

Many people know that the celebration of Christmas on December 25 was just a catholic means to fool the pagans into using their celebrations of the winter equinox as a religious event. True Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus every day.

Any shepherd worth his salt has his sheep in a shelter and he is home in front of a good fire as winter in Israel can get very cold.\nHalloween- This one should be obvious. Christians or even JW don’t allow for the celebrating of demons. \nMother’s day and Father’s Day- This is just basics, the commandments say we should honor our Father and Mother… That means all the time not one just a special day.\nBirthday- Here is where the JW’s get a little strange; in a birthday celebration for King Herod a young girl pleases him with her dance.

I am not a people pleaser, i say yes because i generally think i can do things in a certian time frame but it never works out like that.

Are you committed to getting the job done?  It sounds like you are.  Problem one solved.\n\nProblem two is that your tasks are taking longer than you expected.  Have you examined why they are taking longer?  Is it because you did not have all of the information or tools available?  Is it because the tasks were more complex than you originally thought?  Is it because you've allowed interruptions or other time-wasters to interfere?  Do you have a grasp of how long it typically takes you to accomplish certain tasks?\n\nIt does sound like it is a matter of understanding the time needed to complete tasks.  I would recommend the first step is some self-observation. Keep of a log of what you do and when you do it for a week.  Use that information to determine the length of time that is required to accomplish your tasks.  This will provide a better understanding so that the next time, you can commit without having to worry that you have not over-extended yourself.\n\nGood luck!",1444

8,"What Should I Tell My Son? ; My exhusband and I were never together as a couple for as long as our son was born 3 1/2 years ago. My ex lives in Georgia and I live with our son in Louisiana. I am engaged and we live with my fiancee and we're expecting another baby boy in a week :). My ex husband has not seen our son since June 2005. He has talked to our son once or twice on the phone since then. He hasn't sent pictures or anything like that. He just recently sent a child support payment. Anyways, I made a picture book for our son that has all of the pictures of his father in it. These are pictures from our son's birth and some visitations that he has come to. It's our son's own special little book. Well, the other night, he all of the sudden said that he wanted to look at his daddy book so he pulled it off the shelf and sat on the floor with it. Then, he looked up at me and my fiancee and said ""I need to see my daddy. I miss my daddy."" This really broke my heart. (continued in details below) ; Before you do anything like that, I would sit down with the little guy and try to find out what he really means.  Kids that age may mean something completely different than what we take from their statements.  They just don't have a wide range of emotional vocabulary.  Anyway, see if what he really means is something more manageable for you.  Like, maybe assurance of your love for him even though a new little one is coming to steal you away from him.\n\nAnd if he really wants to communicate with his father, maybe a phone call will be enough.  Or maybe let him make a card to send to his father.  That might be enough to satisfy him so he can move on.\n\nYou can also redirect his attention to something more tangible.  Like making another book, but this time with people he's close to and sees frequently.\n\nI think in the end, you'll just have to try things that are possible for you to do until you run out of options.  I wouldn't tell him anything that would hurt his feelings, though.  I think I would make up something sooner than I would do that (and I hate to lie).",1464

Understanding and empathizing with social norms allows one's perspective to be framed in acceptable ways.\n\nThey are also evaluating the basis for social norms for predictability and for consistency, while ensuring that their own basis is more firmly grounded.

In these poorer countries, good, honest doctors are hard to come by, and even harder to afford. Many only want to save the lives of their dying loved ones. These people work long hours and do back-breaking work for a very inadequate salary. To get here, they have to pay large sums of money, and risk their lives. I know I wouldn't want to have to do that to enjoy the opportunities that I have. I don't understand why they can't be considered refugees. I know that not everybody that has migrated to the US has come for these reasons, but many have. Oh, and America makes it very hard for the latinos to immigrat legally.

That is completely absurd. \n\nFor the record, Mexico and Japan have the strictest immigration law. If you knew what the Mexican government did to persons whom they caught illegally entering their country you would totally rethink how the US treats immigrants. \n\nAlso, our government isn't saying these people can never come to the US to live or work, we just want them to respect the law.

6,"How can you break a lease when you can no longer afford the rent? ; I moved into my apt this past March. I have struggled every single month to make the rent. Three months ago the rent check bounced, the next month the rent was paid late. Finally in Oct I couldn't pay the rent at all. My rental office said if I broke my lease they would take me to court. They suggested I find someone to sublet it to. I asked about a repayment plan and was told to make up my own and submit it for their approval. I did that but have gotten no feedback from them and worse yet I find that I am unable to honor the repayment agreement. I misplaced my lease months ago, I asked for a copy but was told it wasn't their policy to provide copies so I honestly don't know my rights.

6,"What are some highly active government jobs/military jobs? ; I'm male, have always been active, and looking for a job which is within a government agency or maybe even the military. I am graduating from a university in 2008 with a degree in criminal justice. I am looking at one agency in particular, Diplomatic Security. Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

3,"Can you explain the Anglo-Saxon poem called The Wife's Lament? ; I can't seem to find a summary online.  Best answer gets 10pts! ; ok summer here is the best i got:\n\nThis poem is (obviously) a lament, or some sorrow for something lost, also known as an elegy.  In this case, the poem is a woman's song.  She is lamenting the loss of her lover (it is possible that he is simply not there, or absent).  \nHowever, it appears as if ""her lord"" is the same lord that governs the people in this poem.  Therefore, for some reason they are isolating her from him.  Her lord himself tells her to take up a ""dwelling"" that he has apparently appointed for her.  \nOnce there, she meets a man and falls in love with him, claiming that ""death alone"" would separate them.\nFor the remainder of the poem, the woman is expressing her deep grief as she is in exile in what seems to be some type of cave or tunnell in the ground.\n\nhere is a paragraph by paragraph analysis:\n1.  \nHere she is introducing her lament as a sorrowful tale of her utmost woe; that never before has she experienced any distress as dire or excruciating as this.\n\n2.\nhere she explains that her lords family/ gentry sent him on a sea journey.  ""Dawn-cares"" can be interpreted as she either worries about him so much, she is losing sleep, or she wakes up in the morning, and her 1st thought is her husband.  [These compound words are famous in anglo-saxon poetry.]  She decides to go into exile, which was a custom of women to do who were w/o there husbands.  She may have disgraced him and is thencforth banishing herself.  It seems that she is turning to his people for advice, and they have their own plans as to where she should go.  The scheme and plot to send her away and put her in a position which will forever keep them apart. \n\n3.\nHer lord confirms the dwelling place she is to go to.  Where she went for exile, she knows few people.\n\n4.  \nShe falls in love with a man who is depressive and well taken care of.  He also seems to be in exile w/ a broken heart...he may even be suicidal.  They vow together, that, in their exile, they will have eachother.  But, he kills himself, destroying their pact.  she is back to where she stared in her sorrow.\n\n5.  \nFillied with longing, she is sent to live in a cave or some sort of underground hovel.  \n\n6. She describes her surroundings as dismal and ""briar-choked"".  She bemoans that fact that loves walk the earth and experience joy, while she is condemned to despair.  She explains that she can never gain composure because she used to be so full of hope, promise, and she was enthused for life.  Now that everything is taken from her, she is torn.  She takes a turn to curse her lord and wish upon him sorrow and grief, that he may become lost and wandering in his journeys.  She wished upon him a brooding heart and ""breast cares"" (broken heart). \n\nWell, I really hope this helps you!! Good luck with everything!  I will also email this to u so u get it.",1774

Rather, they arbitrarily 'save themselves' through a false hope that all they need is 'faith'.\n But as I have observed time and again on this forum, their is little to no substance to the claims of salvation.\nIf one expects to receive the blessings of everlasting life, but disregards the effort of studying the word of god to find out what is acceptable to him, than, it is ludicrous to think that god will just somehow toss aside his own requirements to accommodate all the lazy people with their unrealistic expectations.\nThe simple truth? denominations are proof of deceitful men drawing men to follow themselves, thus putting a stumbling block in the path of weak minded persons to full of apathy as regards their own wish for eternal life.",1802

When you give your heart to Jesus, you begin a personal relationship with him.\n\nIt's like if the person of your dreams asks you out.  Now you have a boyfriend (or girlfriend).  So then what do you do? Do you just call it a day? Of course not. You spend time with the person, get to know them. You also make mistakes, get into fights, and forgive one another.  All the while the relationship grows, and so does the love.  \n\nIt is the same with Jesus.  You can't just call it a day once you're saved. OK getting saved will keep you from going to hell, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you've repented and accepted His forgiveness, then you are forgiven.  But there is so much more to learn.  You can spend the rest of your life getting to know Jesus personally. The more you seek Him the more you will find Him and the more prepared you will feel. You do this by spending time with him in prayer (both speaking and listening to Him)and spending time in the word (read the bible).  Also if you don't already, find a good church to go to and good Christain friends to help you in your walk with Him.  It really is an awesome journey, but it's up to you to take the steps.\n\nBest of luck and many blessings. :)",2017

My university is big on engineering, compsci, and premed, so I see lots of changes of major -- and polisci pops up quite often for people from all three schools. \n\nI personally was a Computer Engineering major, but ended up going ICS and Anthro after about a year and a half of boredom (considerably more EE stuff than I was expecting, and not enough programming).\n\nPhysics is also a popular transfer. Usually people go for whatever they found interesting while they were in engineering. I took a breadth anthro class that I really enjoyed and I also did a great deal of programming in my free time, so I capitalized on those interests and pursued both majors. That was almost two years ago, and now I'm wrapping up anthro this quarter and will probably graduate in just under two years from now with a pair of full majors (a bs and a ba). So if you have multiple interests, don't be afraid to go for multiple majors or minors -- they add on college time (and $$$) but you won't have any regrets.

You desires were created for a reason, you are just looking to fufill them by the wrong means.  Every woman wants to be loved and romanced.  But romance is more than sex.  Romance involves the heart, soul and mind.  Get to know a persons interests, likes, dislikes, beliefs, habits, family relations, work ethics, ability to be honest even when it hurts, sensitivity to your feelings  even when they don't understand it.  How do they react when your sick, broke, or angry.  Be realistic.  Love is not a Hollywood matter.  If their body changes and is no longer attractive, could you still love them for who they are on the inside.  After all that, if you  like them, and you can love them in the midst of their flaws....You got the right person.",2181

They may be willing to give you a loan which means that you can pay your debt off with one automatic payment a month. I did this and I was amazed that they said 'yes'!\n\nOf course, this doesn't make the debt go away, you've still got to pay it back. The smart thing to do is get a grip on your finances, don't get into any more debt, and aim to pay the bank back quicker than they want you to.\n\nIf the bank isn't an option, then there's a website here with lots of information, pros and cons of debt consolidation.

2,"Ever heard of burning mouth syndrome? ; My mom has had problems with her mouth for over 15 years.She has visited so many doctors and specialists and no one knows whats wrong.Someone told us  she has burning mouth syndrome, which we think they made up.Her mouth hurts all day every day , her lips and gums are numb but are burning at the same time.It hurts her to talk even for 15 minutes. please if any one has heard of this ,let us know if there is a treatment or doctor she can be referred to? ; Yes Burning Mouth Syndrom does exist.  However, it's etiology (cause) is often difficult to localize.  It can be due to a number of different causes, some possibilities are: Anemia, Vitamin Deficiency, Fungal Infection, Neuropathy, Medicine induced and many other causes.  Unfortunately, about 60% of the cases are found to have no known cause (unknown etiology).  These cases are typically found in Older Women, often those who are feeling a bit depressed (often divorced or widowed, etc).  There is a belief that in these cases it has to do with the depressive state and there is actually no dental cause.  If all other causes can be rulled out, then antidepressants can be prescribed.  I'm not trying to say that this is what is causing this feeling in your mother, but I have to let you know that it is a possibility.  My suggestion is to have your mother referred to an Oral Pathologist to try to localize the cause.  Tell her to keep her mouth as moist as possibile (sometimes it is caused by a condition known as Xerostomia (pernounced Zero-Stomia) where the mouth is excessively dry).  They have a product called Miracle Mouthwash that has several components that aid in soothing irrative mouth conditions!  Hope that this proves helpful!",2275

And the skin all around it is itching terribly. The bump is definately not sore to the touch...just itches like hell. So does the rest of that area! It's getting on my nerves. \n\nNow, my boyfriend is a little worried. Could it be herpes? I've never had sexual intercourse with a man who was infected with it, but I am still worried. Or does this seem like usual yeast infection business? Someone please help. ; Don't freak out. It could possibly be a folliculitis (which is a hair bump) or bacterial vaginosis. The best advice I could give you is to pay the doctor a visit. Since you have never been with a person who has a herpes infection, I wouldn't be too worried about it.\n\nBut also know, that if a person has a cold sore, it is a herpes virus. If they perform oral sex on you with an active cold sore, you can develop a herpese infection in your genital area. A person who has genital herpes but isn't currently having an outbreak can still transmit the disease.

1,"Normal subgroups of GL(n, R)? ; In particular, does GL(n, R) have a compact  normal subgroup? Which? If not, what are normal subgroups in GL(n, R)? ; Every group has a compact normal subgroup, namely the identity.  \nAs noted, the scalar matrices form the center of your group G.  Therefore the two-element subgroup {plus/minus I} is also normal in G.\n\nAs noted, the group SL_n is normal in G.  Therefore if H is also normal in G, its intersection H' with SL_n is normal in SL_n.  It is known that if H' is a normal subgroup of SL_n, then H' is contained in the scalar matrices, which are trivial if n is odd and {plus/minus I} if n is even.\n\nIf H is not equal to H' it must contain a matrix of determinant not equal to 1.  If this determinant is not plus/minus 1, then H is not compact.  Let us note that the set of matrices with determinant plus/minus 1 is a normal subgroup of G containing SL_n.\nFor that matter, also note that the set of matrices with positive determinant is normal in G.\n\nThis discussion should enable you to classify the normal subgroups of GL_n.  If you mean *Lie* subgroups we are done.  \nIn particular, there are exactly two compact ones, already noted.",2294

1,"Theory of relativity  and the twin paradox: is the aging biological? ; The twin paradox is a very well-known example to present the theory of relativity. One of twins jumps into a space ship and the other one stays on Earth. Each of the twins moves in relation to each other. The traveler-twin, once back on Earth, is younger than the twin who stayed. \n\nWhat I don't understand is what this aging really means. I DO understand that the watches each of them is wearing show a difference in time. But does the traveler really change BIOLOGICALLY? Does he ""look younger"" than the other twin? In practice, would the traveler-twin get gray hair later than the other twin? Or does aging in this context mean something else? So my question, shortly put, is: does aging in the context of theory of relativity mean 1)just impression that time is going faster on Earth than in space  2)real changes in biology, real physical aging? The twin who returns back from the space ship journey: does he look exactly as old as the other twin or has he really remained younger? ; Yes.  It means that for the twin that stayed on Earth, the time really passed for him, and for the twin who traveled, less time passed.\nThe older twin doesnt just ""look"" older, he really is older.  He really experience that time. And the younger twin really experienced less time passing.",2305

In different contexts, however, the word love has a variety of related but distinct meanings: in addition to romantic love, which is characterized by a mix of emotional and sexual desire, other forms include platonic love, religious love, familial love, true love, and the more casual application of the term to anyone or anything that one considers strongly pleasurable, enjoyable, or desirable, including activities and foods. This diverse range of meanings in a single word is commonly contrasted with the plurality of Greek words for Love, reflecting the word's versatility and complexity.",2306

Bear in mind, that in most municipalities you may not carry a lethal weapon or employ the overuse of force other than necessary to meet the force inflicted upon you; i.e. to incapacitate the aggressor. ; If you are going to get your ass kicked, you must first eliminate any idea of fighting this person, because if you fight them, they will kick your ass if they are good at doing that.\nIf you are in that position, instead of trying to fight them, only focus on destroying them before they can kick your ass.  Because of this, all rules must go out the window...you should and must deploy any means necsessary to take them out.

The United States continues to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and human rights safeguards in Peru and the integration of Peru into the world economy. \nThe United States and Peru cooperate on efforts to interdict the flow of narcotics, particularly cocaine, to the United States.

In this case, this is what I am getting for you from this experience.  \nYou are going through experiences that are allowing you to become wiser (the decision to stay with your boyfriend could have been a big and significant one, and it could be a bond that will last)... it also means that you are involved in some way with the spirit of nature and the wise woman of long ago.  You are interested in mysticism, magic, spirituality, and finding out more about life in general.  This totem has chosen you, to make you aware, that the time is now, to follow through with things that have been on your mind, learn about and start to experience what you have been dreaming of, and talk to those around you more openly about who you really are.",2468

1,"why do some people have slight humps at the top of their spines on the splenius capitis area? ; I am covering human anatomy to qualify as holistic therapist and need to know this answer ; That is a condition known as kyphosis, or Scheuermann’s disease.  This condition occurs when the front of the upper spine does not grow as fast as the back of the spine, so that the vertebrae become wedge-shaped, with the narrow part of the wedge in front. The wedge-shape of the vertebrae creates an increase in the amount of normal kyphosis (front angulation of the thoracic spine). \n\nThe wedging of vertebrae in Scheuermann’s kyphosis is most common in the thoracic spine (upper back), with the apex of the curve typically between the T7 and T9 levels of the spine. Although less common, Scheuermann’s kyphosis may also occur in the junction between the thoracic and lumbar spine (thoracolumbar spine) or in the lumbar spine (lower back). \n\nThe cause of Scheuermann's disease is unknown, but is thought to be due to a growth abnormality of the vertebral body. The growth plate anteriorly (in the front) stops growing but the posterior part of the growth plate continues to grow. This is due to a condition known as osteochondrosis. \n\nScheuermann’s disease does not spread and is not really a “disease” but a condition that can arise during growth. It is more common in males and appears in adolescents usually towards the end of their growth spurt, but can occur in anyone.\n\nIf the roundback deformity is severe, patients are more likely to have discomfort or pain along with the deformity as they age. \n\nLearn more about it at the website below.

I got an overall grade of 89% and she didin't gave me a A. I mailed her twice begging to give me a A beacause I studied hard for it. But she didn't even care. She mailed me back saying that I have to catch a flight ? what kind of responsbility they have? seems like they don't care about our hard work. ; Let's start with the basics: 4 out of 4 A, 3.7 out of 4 A-, 3.3 out of 4 B+, 3 of 4 is a B. For 92.5% and above is at least an A-. I assume you new this before you took the class. 89% is 3.56 well below 3.7. Bordering B+/A-, no where near an A. Begging is not a way of getting a A.\n\nNow let look at the facts: you took a class, did some graded work, and then got evaluated for the work. What that says is that at a given point in time, you got some measurement. That is all. It is not life, it is a temporal measure.\n\nSometimes we win and sometimes we lose. I remember having a 98% and got a B+. It is one of the few grades that I remember, and probably one the few grades that I would like to forget. But it was a temporal measure, that is all.\n\nNo teacher (and if he or she is a really good teacher) likes revisiting grades. You want all your student to do their best, and some student's best in not good enough. It is not pleasant to say to someone that their best was not good enough. Grading criteria is govern by our teachers not our students.\n\nAs unfair as it sounds, hard work is not a factor, it is comprehension. Grades are temporal measures of comprehension. You may have worked hard to comprehend, but hard work is not the measure.\n\nWhatever your grade, it is what you understand that counts. Years from now you won't even remember your classes, let alone your grades. So relax, enjoy the break, and get ready to start another term.",2686
2,"Are rowing machines considered cardio or resistance? ; I've been wondering this for awhile.  On one hand you're constantly moving and it's not THAT hard, like a cardio exercise, but on the other hand you push off with your legs & pull the handle with your arms (which puts off quite a bit of resistance!)  So is a rowing machine considered cardio, resistance, or a happy medium of both? ; Both!\nAny activity that challenges your muscles at loads greater than they are accustomed to via concentric and eccentric contraction is considered resistance exercise.  The duration of the movement and energy system being used then classifies the exercise as cardiovascular or otherwise.\n\nFor example if you were to row as quickly as possible for 10 seconds or less you would primarily use the phosphagen/creatine system which provides ATP immediately to the muscle, so the energy needs are fast and powerful.\n\nIf you were to then continue rowing for 20s to 90s you would involve the glycolytic system (glucose/lactic acid) and anaerobic contributions of to ATP delivery would increase.\n\nIt's not until about 2+ min that you require a much greater oxygen utilization which would kick-in the aerobic system hence a full cardiovascular workout.\n\nSo it really does depend on how long you decide to row.  Since most people row for extends periods, it's usually classified as a cardiovascular exercise although the argument to oppose it would have to fall under the above guidelines.",2694

6,"how is the value of Rupee against dollar determined or for the matter any currency? ; 1 $ = Rs 42.66 today and the value changes the next day. how is this value determined? ; Its pure supply and demand... or at least in principle. If all countries had an open economy, where their currencies where in a floating rate, instead of a fixed rate, supply and demand for that currency would determine its price. Lets say, mexican peso vs dollar. If today the exchange rate is $11.09 pesos for dollar and in the course of the day, international investors come and inyect more dollars to the mexican economy (stock market, funds, etc.), and that is greater than the amount of dollars that go out of the country, then people are demanding more pesos than dollars in that specific day. To put your money on mexican market, you have to do it in pesos, so what happens to your dollars? They are transformed to pesos... making the demand for peso higher than that for dollar. Exchange rate should go down... say $11.01. What determines this? Many factors. The stock market in Mexico has been booming for 2 years, so in 2005, the peso aprreciated against the dollar by almost 7%. But with the Feds moving intreset rates up, money is going to the US since it is less risky and the rates are going up, while in México rates are going down.

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",2798

For every 1kg of something, if it accelerates at 1 meter per second per second (m/s/s or meters per seconds squared), than there is a force of 1N acting on it.\n\nForce is calculated by multiplying the mass (not weight) with the acceleration. For example, if you are 75kg, than there is a force of 75kg X 9.8 m/s/s (acceleration due to gravity: roughly constant on Earth) = 735N pulling you down. BUT, there is a reaction force, in this case the NORMAL, pushing you back up at the same time and force. Therefore, the force pulling you down, 735N, take away the NORMAL, also 735N, and you will have a NET FORCE of 0N because you are stationary. \n\nSo in order to resist something pulling at 14N (ignoring air resistance, friction, etc), it needs to pull back 14N.",2815

8,"How do you forgive treachery and COMPLETE selfishness? ; I have 2 demons I'd like to forgive, but I don't know how. \nOne is my ex-bff whom I thought we would actually be bff, but she suddenly stopped talking to me and didn't give me a clue as to why. There was nothing I wouldn't do for her (within reason), and she did stuff for me, just not as much. She invited me to hang out with her and do stuff all the time, and she was a good best friend. I found out that she had been poisoning others against me behind my back, she was never fond of me to begin with, was annoyed when I called her my best friend, and she was using me. I'd like to forgive her, but I don't know how to forgive treachery.\n\nThe other demon is my dad's g/f. She is THE MOST SELFISH person I have EVER met! She expects things to be done all for her or her way, and never lets my dad or ANYBODY else have their say. She doesn't do anything for herself, her daddy does everything for her and lives across the street from her, she's VERY wasteful, and... ; I don't know if you're a religious person, but since your question is about forgiveness, I'll answer it from a Christian perspective; but please understand that you don't have to be religious in order to benefit from the wisdom of the Bible.  I do not consider myself to be Christian, but I still use many things I read in the Bible to help me through challenges of the spirit such as the one you have describe.\n\nFirst of all, we should ALWAYS forgive others.  Jesus said to forgive people seventy times seven times, which comes out to be 490 times.  If you have to forgive someone more times than that, they are probably so evil that it's not going to matter whether you forgive them or not; at that point your best best would bwe to just get the hell away from them!  LOL\n\nBut I think what he meant was to forgive as much as you possibly can.  But you sound very young to me- it sounds like there's not a whole lot you can do OTHER than forgive; sadly, we are basically powerless in our youth to change the behavior of others, so you'd better forgive wholeheartedly and do it RIGHT.  The following information is lengthy, but it will help you learn all you need to know about forgiveneness:\n\n- This is not an optional action on our part, but rather it is imperative to our own well being that we forgive others.\n- Most Christians understand that this is not always an easy task.\n- For some, there have been people in their lives which have wronged them severly.\n\n- Though it may be a process, and it may not happen instantaneously, we must be willing to take the first steps toward forgiving others.\n- As long as we continue to harbor bitterness in our hearts toward someone else, we allow that individual to have a controlling factor in our lives.\n- There are a number of occasions where unforgiving Christians lose their relationship with God because of what someone else had done to them in the church.\n\n- There was once a man who lost his relationship not only with God, but also his children and people in the church because of his bitterness toward others. He basically went around feeling sorry for himself all the time.\n- To forgive means to ""send away"". In other words, to not hang on to the wrong doing.\n\n- When you forgive someone, it means that you are not holding that sin against that person.\n- Therefore, you're not focused on how you can get back at that person.\n- You're not praying that their boat will sink or that their plane will crash.\n- As a matter of fact, you actually begin to pray for their salvation and deliverance.\n\n- Understand that when you forgive someone, it doesn't mean that you have to re-establish a relationship with that person.\n- It may, by God's will, lead to that and that's great if that's what God desires.\n- In the verse, there's no mention that you should stop praying and go find that person to let them know that you forgive them.\n- Release the thought of anger and bitterness and hurt unto God.\n\n- Forgiveness does not mean, by the way, to forget.\n- Trying to forget is merely an attempt to hide something.\n- When you hide something, someone will eventually find it.\n- We're are to deal with he hurt and send it away.\n\n- Jesus didn't just preach this. He lived this.\n\n(Luke 23:33-34 NKJV) And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots.\n\nFORGIVING OTHERS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND AND RECEIVE FORGIVENESS\n\n(Mat 6:14-15 NKJV) ""For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.""\n\n- It seems as if God's ability to forgive us is contingent upon our ability to forgi",2837

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

I want to lose 10 lbs very quickly, what else do I need to do? ; You need to have high intensity and increase sessions to 1.5 hours here is a plan I follow. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit.  \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.",3254
1,"PHYSICS PROBLEM.. can you answer it? ; Bob and Joe, 2 construction workers on the roof of a building, are about to raise up a keg of nails from the ground by means of a rope passing over a pulley 16 m above the ground. Bob has a mass of 100 kg, Joe 80 kg, the keg 40 kg, and the nails 80 kg. Bob and Joe slip off the roof and the following unfortunate sequence of events takes place. \n\nBob and Joe, hanging on the rope together, strike the ground just as the keg hits the pulley. Unnerved by the fall, Bob lets go of the rope, thus the falling keg pulls Joe back up to the roof where he cracks his head against the pulley but gamely hangs on. However, the bottom falls out of the keg of nails when it strikes the ground. The empty keg rises to the top as Joe returns to the ground. Finally, Joe has had enough and lets go of the rope as he remains on the ground, only to be hit by the empty keg. \n\nIgnoring the possible mid-air collisions, how long did it take for this drama to unfold? use -10 for acc. of gravity. ; Hope this helps...\nBreak this question down into four independent events.  1) Bob and Joe falling, 2) Keg with nails falling, 3) Joe falling, 4) Keg falling.\n\nIf you look at one specific event, then you can assume that both sides of the pulley start at rest (since either it starts that way, or some poor guy smacks the ground or the pulley).  Therefore: look for Fnet on the total masses on the rope.  Take for instance, the first episode, where Bob and Joe (Total mass 180kg) is against the keg and nails (120kg).  Since F=ma, then the individual forces on Bob and Joe = 180(10) and the keg and nails 120(10).  So, Fnet would be 180(10)-120(10) for this specific case.  Then, you would look at the total Force, the total mass, and the acceleration of the entire system.  Once you have the acceleration, then you can easily figure out time, since you have a 16m pulley height (you have to assume Bob and Joe are starting at pulley height, otherwise the problem is unsolvable).  Just use the -1/2at^2+Vot+do=D equation, and since there is no Vo, this should be easy.\n\nDo this for each subsequent episode with the varying masses, and that should give you your total time.  Oh, and the rope has to be massless and the pulley frictionless, too.\n\nAnd unless I'm totally missing something, just plug and chug.  Good luck!",3255

Those are very competitive scores; the question now is not whether you'll get accepted, but how much financial support will you receive based on your scores. You definitely need to consider re-taking the physics test if you can review a few key concepts. You should also look into re-taking the ACT, since it was ""nicer"" to you, to raise your English score and pick up a few more points on Science/Reading. I do NOT recommend re-taking the SATI unless you know one of your target schools does not accept the ACT. Consider getting a little help with your ACT either from a book, or a private tutor.

The stomach and digestive system need energy to function, so they need blood..if you workout too hard or too long, the blood is needed in the muscles, and pulls it away from digestion.

So that's six different sheets of paper. The tricky part is the placement. What I would do is, put them along a hall way. When this person reads all of them, the last one will have your picture glued on it and a place where they can meet you. You could leave a number as well. \n\nOr you could just walk up to this person and say, ""I'd like to go out with you as soon as possible"". This would require some balls but it would be worth it.\n\nOr you could get six of your friends together, tell each one to say one of the following words in order: ""will you go out with (your name)""? Get them to walk by this person, one after the other, each giving this person a rose when they walk by. That will commmand attention.\n\nIf this person doesn't know who you are or asks who you are, that would be your cue to pop out from some where with a rose and introduce yourself. \n\nWell, that was all could think of, off the top of my head.

1,"Can Sago Palms grow in an area that reaches freezing temperatures? ; I live in an area that can reach freezing temperatures during the winter and I have a sago palm planted. Can I leave it outside, or should I bring it inside during the winter months? ; Sago palms can with stand temperatures as low as 10 F, so if it freezes any lower than that your plant will die if it remains outside. If not, it can stay outside, and should be watered only once or twice a month, enough to keep the soil moist. It may start to turn yellow outdoors during cold temperatures, which is due to the soil temperature. Low soil temperatures makes it difficult for plant roots to absorb water.",3334

Since these properties affect the chemical reactions that keep bodies alive, there are built-in physiological mechanisms to maintain them at desirable levels.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that homeostasis is not the reason for these ongoing unconscious adjustments. Homeostasis should be thought of as a general characterization of many normal processes in concert, not their proximal cause per se.

6,"Get married or buy a house first? ; My fiancee and I have been talking about buying a house for almost a year and we're getting into a financial position where we may be able to.\nWe are both wondering whether it would be better to have a wedding first or to get married.  We both agree that buying a house is more important to us then getting married right now.  We still want an actual nice wedding ceromony, we don't want to get married at the courthouse just to facilitate buying a house.\nWe are planning on buying a house in Virginia or North Carolina.  Should we concentrate on buying a house or planning a wedding? ; It really depends on what kind of nuptial ceremony you plan on having?  Something informal with low overhead?  Then sure, get married first as that won't crunch the pocket book.  Now if you want a ""Cinderella"" wedding, then WAIT!!!!!!!!!! I would definitely purchase a house first!! Housing prices generally continue to go up, hence, equity in your pocket!! If you are worried about what family will say, who cares?? It's your life and you are only trying to better it!\n\nGood luck :)\n\nP.S......... purchasing a house sans marriage has absolutely NOTHING to do with who gets what should you seperate prior to getting married.  How you take title DOES!!  Should you purchase the home prior to marriage, you would each take title in your individual name, then after each of your names, you would state ""single man"" and ""single woman"" (assuming neither of you has been married before.  If either of you has been married before, then after that person's name it would say, ""unmarried man/woman"".  You would then have to decide that should one of you die before the other whether or not you want to leave your share of the house to the other person OR to someone else.  I'll give you an example of each:\n\nThis would be if both have never been married before AND want to leave the house to the surviving partner:\n\nJonh Doe- single man and Suzie Smith-single woman as joint tenants.\n\nNow if each of you would prefer to leave your half of the house to someone else, this is how you would take title (again, assuming neither of you has been married):\n\nJohn Doe-single man  (list his percentage of ownership) and Suzie Smith-single woman (list her percentage of ownership) with right of survivorship.\n\nIn this case, you would state in a will or trust or even on a notorized piece of paper, ""who"" your percentage of the house goes to. Also, in either example, if one of you has been married you would just change out ""single"" to read ""unmarried"".\n\nmb",3368

For a station in Earth orbit something higher than 9 km/s seems reasonable, less for lower inclination orbits.\n\nOnce you've got that you then need the exhaust velocity of your rocket, it would depend on what you are using but you can get some rough values from the first source.\n\nWith that the mass ratio is the exhaust velocity times the natural log (ln key on scientific calculators) of the Δv.\n\nThe mass ratio is the difference between the starting and ending mass of the rocket so the amount of fuel will be the (mass ratio minus one) times the mass of the rocket structure + payload.\n\nYou'll probably get something absurdly large (it's very hard to exceed 10 in the real world) and if so then you've got to use staging which makes it a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Soyuz FG which launches the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to the ISS has about 280 tonnes of propellant at launch over all three stages for a spacecraft lighter than 8 tonnes.  Of course the Soyuz FG uses LOX/Kerosene, more efficient propellants like LOX/H2 would need less propellant for the same payload but it isn't going to be an order of magnitude reduction.",3563

Use the following steps to adjust volumes to their correct levels:\n\nIn Windows XP, click Start, and then click Control Panel.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel \nIn Windows XP, open Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices, and then click Sound and Audio Devices.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, open Sounds and Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab. \nIn Windows XP, click the Advanced button under Device Volume.\nIn Windows 98 and Me, click the Volume button under Sound Playback. \nRemove all checkmarks from Mute boxes at the bottom of the Master Volume window and adjust the volume setting slide bars to their highest positions. Close the Master Volume window and test for sound. If there is still no sound, go to the next Step. \n\nStep 2: Verifying the connections:\n\nUse the following steps to verify that the sound cables are properly connected from the speaker to the computer (cable connectors and plug assignments are normally color-coded to aid with connections).\n\nUnplug the sound cable. \nPlug headphones or one speaker directly into the speaker out connector on the back of the computer.

Sound should be restored after replacing the sound cable. If sound does not come back after replacing the cable, the sound card needs to be replaced because the speaker out connector is bad.\n\nStep 3: Configuring on-board sound in the BIOS:\n\nSome computers come with sound on the motherboard (on-board), and some computers use a sound card. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS has to be set according to your particular sound configuration. Perform the following steps to correctly configure the sound in the BIOS:\n\nLook at the back of your computer and use one of the following three items to determine the proper sound configuration and sound setting: \nIf the plugs for the speakers and microphones are located next to the parallel, serial, or USB ports, then the computer has on-board sound. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS should be Enabled. If the plugs for the speakers and microphone are located away from the other ports and sit in an area by themselves, the computer has a soundcard. The on-board sound setting (if there is one) in the BIOS should be Disabled. If the computer has sound plugs in both locations, a \nsoundcard has been added to the computer that already contains on-board sound. The on-board sound setting should be Disabled. To enter the BIOS, turn on the computer and when the first screen appears, press the F1 key repeatedly until the BIOS Setup screen opens. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to select the Advanced tab. Press the DOWN ARROW key to select Onboard Audio Options and press ENTER. If Onboard Audio Options is not available, select I/O Device Configuration and press ENTER.

8,"weed any one know bout it? ; how long does the affects of pot usualey last after u smoke it.. ; Q: How long does marijuana stay in the user's body?\nA: THC in marijuana is rapidly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs. Generally, traces (metabolites) of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session. However, in chronic heavy users, traces can sometimes be detected for weeks after they have stopped using marijuana.\n\nQ: What happens if you smoke marijuana?\nA: The way the drug affects each person depends on many factors, including:\n- user's previous experience with the drug; \nhow strong the marijuana is (how much THC it has); \n- what the user expects to happen; \n- where the drug is used; \n- how it is taken; and \n- whether the user is drinking alcohol or using other drugs. \nSome people feel nothing at all when they smoke marijuana. Others may feel relaxed or high. Sometimes marijuana makes users feel thirsty and very hungry—an effect called ""the munchies.""\nSome users can undergo bad effects from marijuana. They may suffer sudden feelings of anxiety and have paranoid thoughts. This is more likely to happen when a more potent variety of marijuana is used.\n\nQ: What are the short-term effects of marijuana use?\nA: The short-term effects of marijuana include: \n- problems with memory and learning (11);\n- distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch) (6); \n- trouble with thinking and problemsolving (5); \n- loss of motor coordination; and \n- increased heart rate. \nThese effects are even greater when other drugs are mixed with the marijuana; and users do not always know what drugs are given to them.",3702
6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

The outer segments of the photoreceptors are responsible for catching photons of light, which initiates an electochemical signal that ultimately results in vision.  There are two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in lower light levels, while cones are responsible for color and most form recognition.  Rods are dispersed throughout the retina, while cones are most densely packed in the region of the retina responsible for your central, or ""straight ahead,"" vision.  This area is called the macula.  In fact, the center of the macula, the fovea, contains only cones, and they are very densely packed in this area to allow for higher resolution of fine detail.",3785

I want to truthfully answer your question even though you have attempted to set traps. You see age is not the issue you’re attempting to make it. In some countries the life expectancy of a man is under 45 years of age and in many places in the Bible we find that men in other areas have lived in excess 500 years. Certainly life and coupling practices are different under both circumstances. So while age and culture vary the truth you seek is at what age is a given woman old enough to make life impacting decisions on her own. We see that many cultural differences answer that differently how ever being a man who loved too early and now has daughters prone to make the same bad choices, I have found truth in the area of your interest and it is this. First a child must grow enough to read and write and think deep thoughts a child should then contemplate the great depths a life could travel and the results a life could feel because of choices made. A child should realize that there is a higher power and a help in the living of that life. That child should seek first that powerful assistant and His support. Seeking that first could not possibly cause you to miss the match that would have been known to you as the perfect match. However seeking Him first guarantees that when the time is right He will bring to you the one that is meant for you. A woman should wait until God makes the match so that she doesn’t ruin the perfect union with baggage left over from youthful mistakes and indiscretions based only on the physical urges children. You know in some countries adulthood is not recognized until a person reaches their 30’s Perfection does not play worldly games and does not make sence to mankind.

2,"What to eat post gall bladder surgery.........(HELP!)? ; After just having my gall bladder removed I am finding that what ever I eat causes stomach upset and I was hoping that others who have gone down this path would share what worked for them.\n\nIt was an emergency surgery on March 9th/06. I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922
9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace.

0,"What do you know about Furries or anthropomorphic role players? ; I am just wondering what the general opinions of people on this subject are. By the way, I posted a similar question once and it was removed. I REALLY hope it doesn't happen again. ; An object is ""anthropomorphic"" if it has been given human attributes; these usually include the capacity for rational thought, emotions, and an upright posture. An anthropomorphic animal, therefore is a hybrid that is somewhere between a human and the original species. \n\nExamples of furries abound, and these can surely cement the concept for any readers that stopped to re-read the above paragraphs... Most cartoon characters are furries (e.g. Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Wile E. Coyote, etc.). Many cartoon characters are quite removed from the actual animals; their caracatured forms still retain many animalistic traits, however, and this identifies them as furries. Many comic book characters (e.g. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Omaha the Cat Dancer, Usagi Yojimbo), movie characters (e.g. the Rippers in ""Tank Girl"", Barf in ""Space Balls""), and mascots (e.g. the San Diego Chicken and Smokey the Bear) are also, at a basic level, anthropomorphized animals. Finally, furries are also commonly found in artwork, literature, and mythology (I won't bother to list examples here; I think you've got the idea by now). These are diverse categories, and this is one reason that it is hard to develop a comprehensive notion of what constitutes a ""furry"". \n\nThe diversity of furries is due, in part, to the degree to which they are anthropomorphized. Some characters (such as Mickey Mouse) are modified and humanized to such a degree that they only bear a passing resemblance to the animal from which they were derived. Others, such as Smokey the Bear, still closely resemble an animal in appearance.",4088

5,"help in basketball? ; what kind of excersises can i do when i am not playing basketball or near a basketball court.. to help my left hand (im right handed, shoot with left hand, and dribble best with right hand) become better at shooting,dribbbling,layups, etc....also how can i improve ball handling skills on both and/or left and right hands? ; For dribbling, make it a point to dribble most of the time or at least give equal time to dribbling with your weak hand.  Work at dribbling the ball in figure 8's around your legs.  Dribble around cones, dribble baselines at a run getting your speed down pat.  Then dribble backing up against a defender or driving to the hoop against a defender.  If you are driving on the left side of the basket it is best to use your left hand if you can, that way your body is between the defender and the ball.  Same goes for the right side, on the right side dribble with your right hand to keep your body between the defender and the ball.  Another good thing to do when dribbling against a defender is to watch their waist, not their feet.  The waist is where the person's center of balance is.  Where their waist goes, that is where their body is going to go.  You don't necessarily have to keep your eyes on the person's waist.  You can use your free hand as your eyes.  Use your free hand to feel where the person is.  Feel whether they are moving left or moving right by placing your free hand against their waist.  Just make sure you don't use your free hand to hold them by wrapping it around them or to push off.  \n\nDon't keep your eye on the basketball, keep your eyes looking around you and on your defender.  You should be able to dribble the ball without looking at it.  So keep your head up.\n\nTo help improve your dribbling more, some coaches will have a player wear thick clumbsy gloves.  If you can get good with thick gloves on, then it makes it all that much easier when you take the gloves off.  Coaches will also use gloves for training players to catch and pass the ball.\n\nAs far as shooting, watch how much arch you give the ball.  The more arch you give the ball the better chance you have of it going in, especially if you are farther out.  Make sure to bring the ball to eye level before you shoot and keep your eyes focused on the hoop even after you let go of the ball.  When you release the ball, you want both hands to fall down like a wet limp rag.  This helps ensure that the ball doesn't stray left or right.\n\nI like to do a drill where I start out at the base of the basket 1-2 ft away and work my way out to the 3 point line.  I'll take a shot from the left side, then take a shot from the right side or work my way around the hoop in a semicircle then work my way away from the hoop.  I try taking the shots somewhat fast because you aren't going to have a lot of time to shoot them in a game.  Also this keeps you running building endurance at the same time.  By moving from short shots to long shots it helps improve both your short shots and long shots.  It also helps you gauge how much power you have to put behind your shot to hit the long shots.  If you notice you are falling short on your long shots move in a little closer if you are tired or if you aren't tired, put a little more mmph behind them.  If you are overshooting move back a little or reduce the amount of power you give it.\n\nI mentioned earlier about arch increasing your percentage of making a basket.  There is such a thing as giving too much arch to a ball.  By that I mean, the more arch you give to a ball, the more energy it requires from you to shoot it which can tire you out over the length of a game.  To accomodate that, you have to find a good middle ground for the amount of arch you give the ball.  Enough so you make the shot most the time, but not so much that it makes you tired and miss or the ball falls short.\n\nAlso, dont' be afraid to drive to the hoop, if you see the opening, go for it.  You have to be confident in your abilities.  At the same time, don't be a ball hog.  Make sure you pass the ball to players you see that could have an open shot or an open lane to drive to the hoop.  Basketball is a team sport and Bobby Knight didn't have his teams pass it 4-5 times before shooting for nothing.  Although I&#3",4101

Relationships are about two people and their feelings. For example, I have two friends that are swingers...it's totally acceptable for one to pick someone up and snog them without asking the other. They are cool with that... am I? Heck no! My point? You need to sit down with your partner and establish boundaries. They can be conservative, they can be liberal and you don't need statistics to tell you you're right. You only need to make sure it's something both of you can live with. You both must compromise on this one. For example, maybe your partner feels you are unreasonable about your level of social interaction. IE you don't like having people over enough, while he/she would love it if people were over all day long everyday. Maybe the compromise is setting up limits, like ok Monday and Wed nights are open and you can have people over but the other nights you need to ask...or maybe, as soon as you are aware someone is coming over, please let me know. Or maybe its a matter of establishing hours or something. Point is, you need to be able to find a happy medium. If you can't there might be deeper issues you need to look into resolving. Anyhow, the bottom line is the three C's: Communication, Caring and Compromise... Good luck to you!",4184

Evanescence's upcoming release, THE OPEN DOOR, will be in stores on Oct, 3. 2006!\n\nFollowing the multi-platinum, worldwide success of FALLEN, THE OPEN DOOR is an ideal showcase for the band's inevitable personal and professional growth, with songs of introspection, longing, doubt, self-respect and ultimately, empowerment and anticipation.\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles at The Record Plant with long-time friend and producer Dave Fortman, the album is defined by Amy Lee's beautiful melodies, profound lyrics, stunning vocals and poignant piano, which fuse with Terry Balsamo's urgent, yet intricate guitar playing, to form a remarkable, ethereal blend perfectly rooted in the band's rock and classical sensibilities.\n\nAmy Lee shared some thoughts about the upcoming release:\n\n""The making of this record has been really intense, but I've come out feeling purified. I've grown so much since 'Fallen,' and Terry is the perfect writing partner -- I feel like I've been lifted up to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities.

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

3,"Chemistry homework help, Dimentonal analysis for moles and atoms in amounts of sodium. HELP!? ; Its for a chemistry project, I need help, my teacher hasnt been in class for the last week, so I have absolutely no idea what ""mol"" is.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n1. Cut out 3 nutrition facts labels from three different foods. One should be high in sodium compared to the others.\n2. Look for the total grams of ""Sodium"" per serving.\n3. Using dimensional analysis, show haow many moles and atoms of sodium you are eating for one serving.\n4. How many servings of food would you have to eat in order to reach the maximum daily recommended amount of sodium.\n\nIve got the three labels, they are:\n\n1. Frozen Waffles - 480mg of sodium - 20% daily value\n2.Gatorade - 110mg of sodium - 5% daily value\n3.Juice - 35mg of sodium - 1% daily value. ; To get the no. of moles of sodium in each serving, you must use the equation: no. of moles = mass / relative molecular mass\nThe realtive molecular mass of sodium (Na) is 23 (from periodic table of elements) \nSo for the waffles, the 480mg must first be converted to grams. There are 1000 mg in 1g so there are 0.480g of sodium in the waffles. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in the waffles is:\nno. of moles = 0.480g / 23g = 0.02moles\n\nFor the gatorade, the 110mg is converted to grams also, which is 0.110g. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in gatorade is:\nno. of moles = 0.110g / 23g = 0.0048 moles\n\nLikewise for the juice, the 35mg is converted to grams which is 0.035g. The no. of moles of Na in this is:\nno. of moles = 0.035g / 23g = 0.0015moles\n\nTo find the amount of atoms of sodium in each of the samples we use the following equation:\nno. of atoms = no. of moles x 6x10^23 x no. of atoms per entity\n\n(6x10^23 = Avogadros constant)\nno. of atoms per entity = 1 (because there is only one atom of Na in Na)\n\nTherefore, in the waffles the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.02 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 1.2x10^22\n\nFor the gatorade, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0048 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 2.88x10^21\n\nFor the juice, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0015 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 9x10^20\n\nFinally to find out how many servings you would need to get your full recommended daily allowance (RDA), you must do the following:\n\nWaffles: 0.48g is 20% of your RDA\n               0.024g is 1% of your RDA\n               2.4g is 100% RDA\n               Therefore you would need 2.4g / 0.48g = 5servings\n\nGatorade:0.110g is 5% of your RDA\n                0.022g is 1% of your RDA\n                2.2G IS 100% of your RDA\n                Therefore you would need 2.2g / 0.110g = 20servings\n\nJuice: 0.035g is 1% of your RDA\n          3.5G IS 100% of your RDA\n          Therefore you would need 3.5g / 0.035g = 100 servings\n\n\nHope Ive been of help to you!!!\nIf you've anymore questions just ask!",4486

1,"What are the economic and environmental considerations of materials? ; For materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. ; Economic Considerations\n\nResearch has shown that if the soil test is below the desired level, application of phosphorus will provide yield increases that will not only pay for the treatment, but also provide additional income beyond the cost of the treatment. If the soil test is above the cut-off point, i.e. more than 20 pounds above the desired level, it will be in the best interest of the farmer to invest his capital in inputs other than phosphorus as such an addition will not result in a yield increase.\n\nLand tenure and/or availability of capital also affect the economic rate of application. For those individuals that have limited or unknown tenure, or limited capital, it is suggested that they extend the build-up period from the recommended 4 year period to 6 years or in some cases longer. Other than for the most deficient soils, this will not have an adverse impact on yield.\nEnvironmental Considerations:\n\nThere is no documented evidence that excess phosphorus in water supplies creates a human health hazard. Rather, when phosphorus enters surface waters in substantial concentration, it becomes a pollutant by contributing to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants, and, thus to accelerated eutrophication of surface waters.\n\nEutrophication is the process where through nutrient enrichment of surface waters, algae and other aquatic plant growth is increased. This associated increase in aquatic plant growth and their ultimate decomposition limits the use of surface waters for recreation, fisheries, industry, and drinking. In most water bodies, phosphorus is the element most limiting for plant growth. When critical concentrations of phosphorus are exceeded by environmental pollution, eutrophication occurs. The critical concentration of phosphorus for eutrophication that is frequently cited is 0.01 parts per million (ppm).\n\nPhosphorus contamination of surface waters comes from point source emissions (industry and waste water from sewage treatment systems) and non-point sources with agriculture being the primary non-point source. Over the last couple of decades, point source contamination has been markedly decreased. As a result, agriculture has been designated as the primary source of phosphorus entering surface waters. The primary mechanisms by which agriculture contributes phosphorus to surface water is through runoff and erosion. Movement of phosphorus through tile does occur on sandy and organic soils and through macropores of fine textured soils. Studies in the U.S. have found very low concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in tile line effluents, but frequently they exceed a projected critical value of 0.01 ppm phosphorus. If the sorption capacity of the profile of a fine textured soil were to become phosphorus saturated to near the depth of tile lines, there would be a continual excessive supply of bioavailable phosphorus in that tile line outflow. If accepted agronomic practices are followed for phosphorus management, phosphorus released in tile line flow will be minimal.\n\nPhosphorus from agricultural sources enters the stream as either dissolved phosphorus or particulate phosphorus. Dissolved phosphorus is comprised mostly of orthophosphate which is immediately available for uptake by algae. Particulate phosphorus is attached to soil and organic matter particles and as such is not immediately available for plant use. The fate of particulate phosphorus is dependent on the characteristics of the receiving water body. If the existing sediment is low in phosphorus, a portion of the dissolved phosphorus may be sorbed to the sediment. However, if the sediment entering the water body is high in particulate phosphorus, a portion of it may be desorbed into dissolved phosphorus over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThere are several factors that influence the rate of movement of phosphorus from agricultural lands. These include inherent soil phosphorus level, tillage, ground cover, rate and method of applicat",4583

Try to go to the University of the Philippines (U.P.) website and contact them through email or phone, you choose. There are other schools offering English classes for foreigners, however. U.P. is just one of them. Good luck! :)",4687

I want to know why this happened. (i know about the cations and anions going to the anodes and cathodes.) ; I am assuming the electrodes are two large parallel plates, facing each other, separated by a distance (d).  When you apply a voltage (V) across, there will be an electric field created between the plates, which will be :\n\nE = V / d\n\nThe smaller d, the higher the electric field.\n\nThe higher electric field will produce a higher acceleration in the ions, which will result in higher average ion velocities\n\nSince current is the rate of flow of charge, higher velocity will be seen as higher current.",4705
0,"Why are Americans so ignorant about other countries? ; I'm not just trying to be nasty here I'm hoping to make a serious point.\n\nIt seems to me that most (though obviously not all) people from the USA seem to be incredibly ignorant when it comes to other countries. I don't understand, don't you have geography lessons at school? If you do, do they teach you anything about the world outside America? The thing that annoys me the most is the way Americans actually believe in all the stereotypes when it comes to British people or French people or whatever. But it really isn't the same the other way round. I think that on average British people (for example) could tell you more about the United States than an American could tell you about the United Kingdom. But why is this? What is wrong with the American education system?\n\nAlso why do so many people on this website seem to think that this website is only used by Americans? There are many other people using it too so how about you try considering that when you ask questions ; OK abc here is a serious answer to your question. We live so far away from everywhere else (even south America and/or Canada for most of the US) that we just have not had the experience. I'm think i am more knowledgable than most ppl i know, on Europe anyway, since my in-laws are from Liverpool and one of my good friends and her hubby are Irish, but i don't think most ppl in the US even know a person that is from another country (that is not a S. Am country). I know if you live in Englad, Germany, Spain, Italy ect...you can fly to another country in a matter of a few hours and it is fairly cheap. Honestly most Americans would love to be able to visit (can I stay at your house lol) but it is to expensive. I think this goes along with the education question. Its not that we don't learn our history, it is just much easier to remember something if you have visited the place (i can give you quite a detailed account of the Alamo) or if your family was involved (Revolution, cilvil war). If you are wondering if we learn about the daily habits (such as food perference, job opportunities, fashion) of the modern English at school no we don't, but I really don't think that it would be the job of the school to teach this.\n\n\nI also think that the reason we love accents is because we rarely hear them!

The plant is shut down when it is ""subcritical.""  A nuclear accident can occur if the reactor goes ""supercritical.""  A supercritical plant can release uncontrolled heat drying the core and melting it.  A melted core would fall by gravity toward the center of the world (like anything else that falls).  Since Canton OH was almost directly opposite Canton China on the globe, the core would fall toward China, thus the China syndrome.  Of course the core would have to melt its way past the plant barriers but would not release enough energy to reach China let alone deeply penetrate the earth.  For those with a wild imagination, China would also be protected by the massive molten layer in the center of the earth that surrounds the extremely hard metal core.

I believe in science\nand love science. And for both of us it is beyond science. It is the\npower and the beauty and the generosity and the love of nature, mother\nearth, and this world we inhabit. We believe in the gift of life given\nto us in the air we breathe, in the purity of water that purges our\nbody of toxins, in the energy of fire that gives us warmth and guides\nus in darkness, in the fascinating complexity of soil which enables\ngrasses and bushes and trees to grow and provide sustenance to the\nliving. Am I in awe of nature? It never ceases to amaze me and make me\nfeel grateful for its bounties.\n\nDo I feel the presence of God in nature? I do.  Do I believe that God\ncreated everything as a master planner or a designer who had every bit\nand every piece in his mind and who had the power to create the\nuniverse with everything that inhabits it? I don't. I believe that\nthere was a big bang in the universe. That everything was created from\na single source of matter and energy. That before the big bang time\nstood still. There was no space. There was no gravity. There was no\ntime! That there was carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and\nphosphorous after that amazing event and everything that we see around\nus and we know exists around us has come to us from these elements.\nJust like a baby in the womb starts off that single cell. And from the\nmother's body it draws food and air and grows into a wonderful living\nbreathing beautiful child. Do I believe we evolved from apes? Yes I\ndo. Do I believe that there is lightning when static electricity gets\ndischarged into the Earth? Yes I Do. And I laugh at the Hindu belief\nthat Lord Indra wields the power of lightning and rain in his hands. I\nlaugh without fear or shame that I am rebuking God.\nSo what is God for me now. I say 'now' because I also have prayed in\ndesperation to God for help or forgiveness. But I have rejected the\nidea that God is an entity who will judge me for my actions, who will\nreward me or punish me for my karma. I believe I will receive my due\nfrom the society, from my family and my friends and every life I\naffect and every life that effects my in any way. While I am alive.\nAnd when I die I will become one with the earth or water or fire or\nair. I don't care which. So who is God for me? God for me is the\nbeauty of life. The happiness that beauty brings us can never be\ndescribed by or encompassed by Science. It is God that makes me smile\nwhen a bird picks up a worm and puts it in a little bird's hungry\nbeak. Will I be able to ever explain it by science? Never! The poor\nworm died. But still there is such a power in the act of a mother\nfeeding its baby that the death of a worm is joyous. The beauty of a\nflower blooming. When I was a kid I used to sit in front of the\nevening Lily plant and watch its petals open one by one. Love and\nBeauty and the Joy they bring to us are God to me. Then God is within\nus and it is outside us. God has always existed ever since any living\nthing has existed. God is everywhere. And it is the knowledge itself.\nAnd it has the power to move every person who has God in his heart. An\nOmnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent entity. That is the definition of\nGod I feel all religions lead to. Our capacity to experience love, joy\nand beauty is God to me.\nJesus was the son of God. He did not walk on water. I will never\naccept that. Krishna was the son of God. He did not have the power to\ndisplay his stupendous universal form to Arjuna in the battlefield and\nmake him see the entire universe present inside his mouth. I will\nnever believe that there were events that happened as literally as\nthat. No miracles, no magic, no superhuman powers, no healing of the\nill and no decimation of the devils. Jesus loved humanity. His love\nempowered him to amazing peaks",4823

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree. And when the stomata (the hole on the underside of the leaf) opens for gas exchange, one water molecule at a time evaporates from the leaf, thus pulling the chain up one by one. Hope that helps!",4875

But they never look at the money that smokers bring into the NHS. Cigarette tax makes up a huge portion of the cost of cigarettes and pays a large amout of NHS costs.\n\nI don't like breathing car exhaust fumes every day and the rise in Asthma has been linked to the replacement of lead in petrol with the lung irritant Benzine.

Everytime he said ""quantify,"" they would giggle.  Does it sound like something in Japanese? ; This is a tough one.  How does your boss pronounce the word?\n\nOften, people change the ""t"" in ""quantify"" to a softer ""d"" sound so it sounds like ""kwandifai.""\n\nOthers leave it out entirely so it sounds like ""kwannifai.""\n\nIn both cases, they start with kwan, which sounds to me like ""kuwan"" an informal form of the verb ""kuu"" which means to eat.  To eat is usually translated to ""taberu"" but ""kuu"" has a baser hungrier meaning.  That sounds giggle-worthy to me.  :-)\n\nThere aren't any words that are close to ""nifai"", but ""fai"" by itself is close to ""faibu"" (the final bu is not always very loud), which means ""five.""\n\nI remember a similar incident while I was teaching English at a Japanese Junior High and every time I said ""Ready, set, GO!""  the class would giggle.  It turned out that the rhythym of the words was very similar to a slogan for a popular moth repellant on TV that went ""Tansu ni GON!""  \n\nI didn't think it was funny / similar at the time, but something like that could have been going on their heads.

0,"Dreamcatchers..? ; I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything? ; The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t",4932

Multiple encounters increase the risk of transmission substantially.\n\nContrary to popular belief, HIV is actually quite difficult to catch. It is about 5000 times more difficult to contract than Hepatitis C for example (another sexually transmitted disease).\n\nYou should always use a condom if you want to avoid risk; you cannot rely on a person knowing their status. You don't know your status right now do you? And it takes several years for AIDs to develop, so often people feel and appear completely healthy while being infectious.\n\nThe chance of transmission varies with the time that the person has been infected. In the early stages they can be very infectious (before there are any signs). They wil become less infectious after a while and if they are on a therapy, they may reduce their viral load so as to be imperceptable. This doesn't mean you cannot catch it from them but the chances are reduced.\n\nThere is nothing you can do at this time except wait, and do not have unprotected sex with anyone else.

At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.\n\nThe Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities. Many of these Jews spoke only Greek.\n\nThe early Christian Church was born into this world. The Church, with its bilingual Jews and more and more Greek-speaking Gentiles, used the books of the Septuagint as its Bible. Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint. \n\nThe books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).\n\nThe Christian Church did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint.\n\n1500 years later, Protestants decided to change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon. The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.\n\nHere is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/\n\n+ The Celibate Clergy + \n\nThe celibate clergy did not come into full bloom until about 1000 A.D. There were many married priests, bishops, and popes before this time.\n\nFirst, Judeo-Christian tradition has always held that single people be celibate. This is taught by Judaism and Christianity from before the Scriptures were written down.\n\nThe question should be: Why can't priests marry?\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nA priest is ""married"" to the Church. Some people think that a priest who takes his duties seriously cannot take proper care of a wife and family. ""A man cannot ser",4992

9,"Can someone from Army finance answer my question? ; My husband was in the Marines for 4 yrs.  He was inactive reserve for 4 yrs.  He has been active duty Army for 18 months.  PSB gave him credit for 8 yrs of service when he came into the Army.  He re-enlisted last week and was told his bonus was smaller due to be a ""long term"" service member.  This week when his LES became available for viewing I noticed that his base pay was not what it usually is.  He is in Iraq so when he called I told him to check on his pay.  He was told by finance that his time in service had been done incorrectly by PSB here at Ft Bragg and that he now only has credit for 5 yrs of service and his pay was being adjusted accordingly.  They also said that they were giving him 8 yrs of credit in relation to his retirement, but not in relation to figuring his pay.  Can they take away yrs of credit after almost 18 mos. now in the Army?  Should he now be eligible for a larger bonus?  We have to repay the money he was paid in error (@ a rate of $850/mo!).  What can I do? ; Oh boy, I've got terrible news and I hate to even write this - but there is some good news, kind of. First, everything finance has said to date is correct. For pay purposes, only active time can be counted, hence his 4 years + 18 months would put his pay at 5 and 1/2 years approximate. For retirement purposes, they will count the whole stint. (This is the difference between his BPED and BASD dates). It sounds like the initial PSB screwed the pooch on this one. Worse yet, it would also change his eligibility for certain bonuses - so this all sounds legit. Now the semi-good news. If he goes to his finance office, he can have those repayments extended out further (in fact, they can even spread them out over the rest of his contract) under a financial hardship request. His chain of command will have to approve it - but that will be a rubber stamp (or should be). If you need immediate relief (i.e. they already took the money and you are short for bills and what not) you can go to your installation ACS (Army Community Service) and apply for an AER (Army Emergency Relief) loan. His command normally has to approve that as well - but you should be able to process it through his rear detachment. This is terrible that someone's error can so negatively effect you - and no - it sure doesn't seem right. Unfortunately, it is what it is and I wish you the very best. Thank you both for your service.\n\nI would check 2 additional locations for relief. One I recommend, the other I would be wary to do. #1 - have him notify his chain of command FIRST, and then file an IG complaint and request relief from the debt through them. (I imagine your command is going to support this action). The other action is congressional. The problem with a congressional inquiry (writing your congressman for action) is that it takes a significant amount of time as it will first get routed to his unit and bounce around before it finally lands on the PSB and Finance. This also tends to irritate folks beyond all belief and can get your husband a reputation - not all that positive. I would wait to pull the congressional trigger as a last minute, desparate shot. Use the IG and Finance first. I can't make any promises, but this sounds like the best shot. Unfortunately, I have known a few soldiers who have gone through similar ""corrections"" and have never seen the debt forgiven. They will spread it out as much as possible, but I think you may be up against a long shot. I truly apologize - it shouldn't be like this.",5033

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness. It is often brought on by stressful situations, such as relationship difficulties, health problems, the aftermath of an accident or the death of a loved one. \n\nThe mental illness known as a ""nervous breakdown"" may also be something like panic attacks, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or acute stress disorder. \n\nSurveys show that about one-third of Americans feel on the verge of a nervous breakdown at some point. Studies estimate that 50-million Americans suffer some form of mental illness in their lifetime. \n\nThere are many disorders that can fit within the criteria of ""Nervous Breakdown"", but those that most commonly occur are those related to:\n•Anxiety \noGeneralized Anxiety Disorder \noPanic Disorder \n•Panic Attacks \n•Trauma Disorders \noPost-Traumatic Stress Disorder \noAcute Stress Disorder \n•Psychotic Disorders \noSchizophrenia \n•Mood (Affective) Disorders \noDepression \noBipolar Disorder",5073

The trouble is, the picnic site is 10 miles away, so the turtles take 10 whole days to get there. \nBy the time they do arrive, everyone's whipped and hungry. Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. \n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food. So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady. \n\nTwenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise. Another day passes, and still no Poncho, but a promise is a promise. After three more days pass without Poncho in sight, Steve starts getting restless. ""I NEED FOOD!"" he says with a hint of dementia in his voice. \n\n""NO!"" Joe retorts. ""We promised."" \n\nFive more days pass. Joe realizes that Poncho probably skipped out to the Burger King down the road, so the two turtles weakly lift the lid, get a sandwich, and open their mouths to eat. But then, right at that instant, Poncho pops out behind a rock. \n\n""Just for that, I'm not going."" ; 2/10. see teacher",5088
2,When i have sex with my wife i usually come within 30 seconds? ; When i have sex with my wife i usually come with in 30 seconds and then we usually never try the second time.\nCan you guys really help me how to solve my problem ; Did you practise holding back when you masturbated growing up. Basically every time I masturbated growing up I'm practising holding back and recognizing the feeling of getting close then backing off. Its just slowing down or slightly changing your rhythm. Its a practise thing. Also pulling out (if slowing down doesn't help) and tapping your glans (tip) against your wife's vagina will stop you from climaxing if you are getting close. (the part facing away from your belly button) Other ways to help prevent climax. Wear a condom. Masturbate relatively often or have sex more often. I have a much harder time holding back if I haven't ejaculated in a while. Experiment with your body in this regard. They also have creams that supposedly delay climax. I've never tried them so I don't know how effective they are. The solution is in here. Good luck.,5093

First time she had an old friend get in the way, and they pursued a relationship. The second time she indicated that if I lived closer she would pursue a relationship but didn't want a long distance relationship. We kept in touch and emailed almost daily, pretty much excessively as many as 20 times a day (considering we both have office jobs, that wass pushing it I think). About 3 months ago I told her (casually) that I was seeing somebody. She immediately suggested that she was coming to my town and wanted to hang out for awhile. We did. She asked how things were going with the g/f, and I told her they were ok and that we were reaching the make or break point of the relationship. I asked her if she was seeing somebody, and she hesitated (what does the hesitation mean) before saying that she had been seeing somebody for a year. I told her I was happy for her. We had a nice innocent time together. On that following Monday I emailed her and said that I was happy for her that things were going well for her. It’s been a month and she hasn’t really kept in touch at all, not like she used to. Any ideas on what her intentions were and what the heck she is thinking now?

1,"Can an antibiotic act as an antibody? ; I'm trying to answer this question comparing the disk diffusion method and animal model.  If a disk diffusion method does not show any signs of zone inhibition but the animal model does recovery from the infection, what would be the causes? ; No, antibiotics are compounds that inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria whereas antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to bind to a specific epitope such as the glycopeptides on some bacterial surfaces. Once bound, they can trigger other immune responses to kill the invading bacteria.\nThe problem with the disk diffusion method of antibiotic susceptibility testing is that it can't be a true representative of what goes on in vivo in your animal model. The test gives the bacteria ideal growth conditions with the addition of the antibiotic, but there are many more factors to take into account in the animal model. Antibodies are a good example as they will help the immune system attack the bacteria. The addition of the antibiotic in the animal probably helps keep the numbers of the bacteria down while its building an immune response to clear the infection.",5216

A company called Tradenet operates in many African countries giving market prices on yams, cassava, rice...  In Ghana Busy Internet is planning to start top-ups to its internet and home ISP credits via the 'services' menu in a Areba (a GSM operator) sim card.  The 'services' menu is usually not much used, but operators could make much more use of it.  Ringtones haven't picked up in West Africa, nor have data services, apart from a few business persons.  \n\nBelieve it or not, the most added value service is the fact that you make sure that your recipient doesn't pick up you call.  I.e. just like in Europe in early days of mobile phones, you just ring once or twice, and hang up.  It can signify 'hi', 'I care about you', 'I'm awake', 'I'm on my way' or 'Call me back'.",5250

2,"what is the analysis and interpretation of a dark amber urine? ; urinalysis ; As others have mentioned, one cause is dehydration or simply not drinking enough water. If you drink a lot of water, your urine will tend to be pale yellow. If you take a lot of vitamin C, it will be dark yellow because excess vitamin C is eliminated from your system.\n\nHowever, there may be other reasons for dark amber urine. Try drinking a few glasses of water. Don't drink too much, but a couple of bottles of water should be fine. If your urine becomes lighter, then it's probable that you simply didn't have enough clear fluid in your system.\n\nIf the urine remains dark amber, and/or if you have other symptoms, like pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, pain or tightness in your stomach, aches in your back where your kidneys are located, etc., you should see a doctor.\n\nDark amber urine may also mean you have some blood in your urine. If you think this is the case, you should definitely see a doctor.",5264

Not sure. ; The only thing I can think of that would be style related and not the store would be the Navy Pea Coats.\n\nPea Coat\nSailors who have to endure pea-soup weather often don their pea coats but the coat's name isn't derived from the weather. The heavy topcoat worn in cold, miserable weather by seafaring men was once tailored from pilot cloth — a heavy, course, stout kind of twilled blue cloth with the nap on one side. The cloth was sometimes called P-cloth for the initial letter of ""pilot"" and the garment made from it was called a p-jacket — later, a pea coat. The term has been used since 1723 to denote coats made from that cloth.",5287

You are all three of those things, but you are one person.  \n\nThere is a lot more to it, but they are all the same with different traits and do different things for us.

5,"What can be done to fix the BCS? ; The BCS is the biggest crock ever conceived. As of the Week 12 ranking, there are some inexplicable rankings. USC: 3rd? I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th). Furthermore, the Pac-10 as a league is laughable, they have one or two powerhouses that basically play scrimmages for a season and have an easy roll into the BCS bids. Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid. A playoff system needs to be established to discover a true champion, maybe use the bowl games as the playoffs leading to an ""Uber"" bowl game. Preferences should cease being given to bigger schools, both in rankings and officiating, by my count USC should've lost at least 2 other times. What say You! ; 8 team playoff in three weeks.  \n\nBut, with the system now, why should you play for the championship if you can't even beat the teams in your conference?

I took up science because my parents wanted me to be an engineer (sigh). I have always been dreaming of running a hotel. MY hotel. The steakhouse would be superb. The lobby would fit a wedding ceremony. The bar would be the talk of the town. All of the customers would be well-attended and personal preferrence of each and every regulars would be noted. When I was choosing a course for my undergraduate studies, my parents asked me to take up mathematics, but without their knowledge, I changed my option to Business (majoring in Tourism and Hospitality) - the degree that I ahve been eyeing since 5 years back! I knew it was a risk because I don't have any basics in Business. I even failed my accounts when I was 15! But I was thinking to myself - Nick, either you take up this course and finally you can own a hotel you've been dreaming of since you were a kid, or you can take up Mathematics or Engineering and die without achieving your greatest dream."" So I opted for my dream course - and they accepted me. To me, the only key to success is that, if I love what I study, I can prove to others that even WITHOUT basics in Business, I can get good grades. I'd do almost anything to make my dream come true. Now, I've made a lot of contacts with the personnels from several hotels around town (I even knew the Human Resource Manager of one five star hotel) and also several travel agents...and I actually just finished my first year of studies. My grades? For the first semester, suprisingly, I got 3.42 (a mere 0.08 shy from getting Dean's List) and last semester, I got 3.77. Were the lecturers helpfull? You might be suprised if I tell you that some mentioned to the class that ""Oh, you've learned this chapter when you were in high school, so I'd skip this one"" - most of the time. (99% of students have Business backgrounds). Were last semester's subjects easy? Most of my friends' grades were going down...and they were frantically suprised to see me, knowing NOTHING on Business the first time they met me, emerged as the best student among 300+ students from my faculty. What was my motivation? ""I'd do almost anything to make my dream come true"". And I hope you would too.\n\nSincely,\nNick Ramzey\nFuture Manager and Owner of Kipalli's Inn",5421

8,"WHAT does LOVE means IS it A true FEELING???????? ; I am agirl and iam bit confused about this ; Love is truly a feeling, but that feeling is not always truly love. this is an excerpt from an article I wrote on this subject.\n\nWhen we look at the subject of love and romance, we all come to it with our own pre-set ideas on what it means. And often this is contrary to what God says about the subject. While the Bible does not give a set pattern or prescribe a certain way of doing things, there are a number of principles found throughout the Bible, which we can take and apply to our various mindsets and preconceptions.\n\nWhat we need is a renewing of the mind through the washing of the water of the Word of God. Most of us never even think to question the way things are around us, but the truth is that when the gospel of the kingdom comes, it will clash at times with the way things are and challenge the status quo. Are we willing to stand up for what is right and say that the way things are is not the way they should be and advance the kingdom of God in our own hearts and lives? Are we willing to challenge our brothers and sisters to walk in a manner worthy of our calling as saints of the living God and not submit to the pattern of this world? (Rom. 8:29, 12:1-2) This is not something that you can be convinced of (even though it is true), but something that comes as a revelation from God. Are you willing to allow God to give you His perspective on this subject? (Pray here for the Holy Spirit to give revelation.)\n\nThis is a subject largely untouched by our Christian teachers today. And I believe one reason is that most have never thought about it deeply, and another is that people don’t really want to hear it. John 3:19-21 speaks of people who saw the light, and preferred to continue in darkness because they loved what they were doing and didn’t want to change. However, as the people who bear the very name of Christ, we must come into the light so that our deeds may be seen to be of God. In 2 Tim. 4:3-5 Paul warns Timothy that people will hire teachers who teach things that tickle the ears and don’t produce lasting change, because they don’t want to be confronted with the truth, and not to let that keep him from teaching what is true.\n\nOne of the major strongholds I see in our (Western) culture is what I have termed “Romance”. This is often mistaken for love, and is commonly made the focus of almost all our efforts in the process of determining who we want to date/marry. Dean Sherman sometimes calls this our “date-ability”. I want to give you a few little guidelines for how to tell the difference between love and romance. Please understand that this is not the dictionary definition of romance, and in the right context romance is one of the greatest of all the gifts God has given us, but I could not find any other English word that came closer to expressing the idea I want to convey. Romance (in the commonly accepted sense) is absolutely necessary for a life-long relationship, and one of the great joys that offset the sufferings of love, but you cannot build a lasting life together on romance alone. Love will develop all the good qualities of romance, while rejecting the selfish ones and in the end be more fulfilling. Love is the foundation on which romance must be built. What our culture/society teaches us, and the idea I wish to counter here, is that romance is the foundation on which to build love. I give you the divorce rate in our culture/society: More than 50% the last time I checked. This is possibly the greatest contributing factor for so many marriages failing, although there are many other factors as well. Because as we grow up, we are taught (sometimes unconsciously) that romance should be the primary motivator, and in some cases we come to believe that it’s the only motivator; but romance will simply fade away if it’s not built on the solid foundation of love. Developing romance before love can actually hinder the development of love. \n\nBefore going any further, let me give you my definiti",5561

Whatis the difference? ; A line of credit is usually an unsecured expandable account from which you can either take a lump sum or draws against the note amount. A home equity line of credit is a line of credit attached to your property's title. Truth be told you would probably be better off to just refinance your house... right now with the fed raising the prime rate in the fashion that he is, you can actually get a lower rate by refinancing your whole home as opposed to paying prime plus 1 or even plus 2 in some cases.

And the real clincher is that I don't have a degree, and the only job experience I have is at a grocery store (which I did not like working at). So what should I do? ; Try to get the job that you like. Do all your best to get it. Do not stop. Do not give up. Say to yourself: ""Nothing can stop me to get the job I like"". Because if you give up and get the job you  don't like, it will be a boring day-to-day torture to go to your job every morning till the retirement, and you will hate it. When you hate it you'll never progress, will not be promoted, and will never be satisfied. And when you get retired you'll be very sorry that you chose to give up and had to take what you thought was only option for you. So, go for your dream! We live only once.

The KJV is a horrible translation  that is nowhere near the greek of the Bible. ; In the Hebrew OT, YHWH (still to close to the name of God for Hebrews to feel safe) was frequently replaced with Adonai - Hebrew for ""Lord."" (which is why the Greek NT uses Kurios - ""Lord"").  Your 13th Century monk used the vowled from Adonai with YHWH to form YaHoWaH - but in Ecclesiastical Latin 'J' and 'W' did not exist, so it became Jaehovah.\n\nMajor literary works, like the KJV, do as much to create language as to use the existing language.

A daily update would be more efficient.\n\nAnother problem would be displaying the prices.  You'd need a touch-screen with a menu system, first showing a menu of currencies accepted, and then the items for sale (so that you can display the menu in the currency of choice)  If the item menu displays the prices in several different currencies at once, it would be too cumbersome.\n\nHer's another option - say you are returning from Europe with a few Euros here, a few pounds there, some Rials, and a few Rands.

If that is true, what must have happened to the original rocks? ; I will answer first the easy one. The oldest rocks are found in the pacific plate, the ones near the marianes trench, but their age is not 4.6 bya. Because old rocks return inside the earth through subduction zones. \nRefer to rock cycle.\nNew rocks are produce at the MOR (mid-oceanic ridges) and old ones are consumed at the subduction zones.\nThere are no very old rocks in continental crusts because they were weathered and eroded and brought to seas through rivers.\nNow about fossils. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks forms when sediments accumulates and cemented. Like lakes, and seas. Usually these place occur life. For example a leaf fall from a tree and left at the bottom of the river. Sediments pile over the leaf and thus preserved.\nIf lava piled over a life (like a leaf) the life or existence will burn and thus not preserved.\nFor fossil to occur it must be preserved. Its very difficult to preserved something if heat is involved.",5956

Is this an evolutionary oversight, or is there a reason behind it? ; One theory is that when feeding in the dusk, rabbits run to their burrows on the least alarm, and that it would be very important for those who were furthest off, and especially for the young, to be able to follow the others without any hesitation in a straight line.

The term can apply to a modern day rifled machine gun with a calibre of 20 mm or more (see autocannon).\n\nCannon also refers to a large, smooth-bored, muzzle-loading gun used before the advent of breech-loading, rifled guns firing explosive shells. Although a variety of such guns are commonly referred to as ""cannon"", the term specifically refers to a gun designed to fire a 42 lb shot as opposed to a ""Demi-cannon"" (32 lb), Culverin (18 lb) or Demi-culverin (9 lb). ""Cannon"" derives from the Latin canna—a tube. Bombard was earlier used for ""cannon"", but from the early 15th century came to refer only to the largest weapons.

5,"Where was the first baseball game played? And Who Invented It? ; Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan. ; The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as ""The National Pastime"" or ""The National Game."" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that ""David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all—the Abner Doubleday–Cooperstown story.""

0,"isn't it obvious that God is real by now? ; please. ; Read this u'll know everything about God, u'll know whats real and whats obvious, whats the truth about God, i guarantee u\n\nWho is God?\nWho has been remembered as the Ocean of Love, the Intellect of the Wise, the Almighty Authority, the Comforter of Hearts, the Truth, The Living Being and the Blissful One?\nGod Says:\n I am the Ocean of Love; \nI show you the path of love. \nMy love remains unbroken and constant. \nI cannot forget even one of you. \nI have so much love for you,  \nand My love is unconditional and unlimited. \nI am the Beloved.You have been calling out to Me for a long time. \nWho Is God?\nWe are used to knowing things by seeing them, hearing them, tasting them, touching or smelling them. Most of us have grown up in a ‘seeing–is–believing’ and ‘hands on’ culture and we are used to perceiving things in that way. Because we can’t see, hear, taste, touch or smell God, the question arises – is God for real?\nOne can reach out to God with pure thoughts and be connected to Him. The soul experiences the response of pure feelings and spiritual strength. God is truth itself and thus can be recognized with the eye of truth.\nGod: The Supreme Soul\nLike us, God is also a soul. Unlike us, He is referred to as the Supreme Soul – the only soul who never takes a body (gross or subtle, human or angelic) of His own. He is beyond the effects of actions and is never subject to the dualities of birth and death, pleasure and pain, success and failure. Being beyond the limits of time of this physical world, He retains absolute knowledge of the universe and all its dimensions.\nWhere is God?\nGod lives, not everywhere but somewhere. A thought of God almost always takes the eyes upwards, as though one is perhaps expecting a face to miraculously appear from behind the clouds or to beam down from the moon. Thoughts are powerful. They link one soul to another. If they are properly channelled, thoughts can even go where only the soul can travel – beyond the moon and stars to a dimension of golden red light, the original home of all souls. Immersed in the experience of the warmth of this light, the soul feels as though it is truly at home at last, and with God.\nGod – The Spiritual Sun \nLike the physical sun, which gives light and life indiscriminately to all beings, God is the Spiritual Sun, giving light to all, whomever and wherever they may be. He serves altruistically, without any selfish motives, reminding each one of their innate qualities of love, peace and happiness. This is why He has been remembered in some countries and cultures by the name Shiva, The Benevolent One.\nGod’s Wisdom, Love and Power\nPeople may wonder why, if God exists, He doesn’t wave a magic wand and fix things, making or at least influencing everyone so that they do exactly what they ‘should’ do. But God never takes away anyone’s freedom of choice. God’s wisdom is to recognize and respect each soul’s individual identity, freedom and inherent goodness. God shares knowledge – a profound understanding of the dualities and dilemmas of love and hatred, happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, etc. – but He does not make our choices for us. The soul is free to choose ‘to be or not to be’, ‘to love or not to love’. God’s love strengthens the soul’s will to free itself from the distresses caused by vices such as selfish desire, anger, fear, ego and attachment. God’s power helps the soul to recognize its highest potential and to aim for perfection by practising the art of simple living and high thinking. Such practice by a significant number of souls eventually brings about positive change in the whole of humanity.\nWhen you learn to tune your mind in meditation to the mind of God, then whatever the situation, you always have a source of help and strength to draw upon – an infinite reservoir of power and virtues that is only a thought away",6030

""When she was young she could eat everything and not gain weight"" This demonstrates there is not much wrong with her genetically as she spent many years eating normally. The reason she cannot stop herself now is as a result of an Anxiety that is similar to the feeling of hunger that she cannot relieve in other ways so she takes the message of hunger and tries to relieve that. This type of hunger can never be satisfied. Look for the source of her anxiety. some seven years prior to her first starting to gain weight. \n\nHope this is help full for you both.",6051

As for gothic culture, being goth has nothing to do with what clothes you wear or music you listen to, it is a way of thinking and seeing the world. The clothes that goths wear and the music that goths listen to is just a reflection of that mindset. Goths see that there is extreme pain and evil in the world, along with the good. Instead of condemning it or ignoring it, goths accept these things as a part of life and try and enjoy the good along with the bad, since they can't stop the bad from happening. They are not obsessed with death, they just accept it as an inevitability. They do not try and cause more pain in their (or anybody else's) lives, since there is plenty to start with.

3,"Tsunami????? ; which countries in future r in danger of being hit by a tsunami ????? ; History repeats itself, so I say one of the below:\n\n""Previous tsunamis\nSee also List of historic tsunamis by death toll.\n\nTsunamis occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a global phenomenon; they are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides. Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events.\n\n[edit]\nCirca 65 million years B.C\nA meteor impact created the Chicxulub Crater about 65 million years ago. This impact may also have caused the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. There is clear evidence for a tsunami more than one kilometre high. (See Discovery of the Chicxulub Crater.) The tsunami disturbed and transported sediments over a huge distance.\n\n[edit]\nCirca 1,500 B.C.\nThe eruption of the Santorini volcano about 3,500 years ago generated a megatsunami estimated at 600 feet. The effects of this megatsunami disturbing sediment at the bottom of the Mediterranean have been found. It has been theorised that the story of The Passage of the Red Sea as described in the Torah may have been due to this. Proponents suggest that the tsunami could have caused waters to recede temporarily and then drowned the Egyptian army when they later returned, however this is purely speculative. The Tsunami was nonetheless a real event that has been proved by geologists. [7] (See Cause of the Passage of the Red Sea.)\n\n[edit]\n1607 - Bristol Channel, England and Wales\nIn 2002 it was suggested that the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 in England and Wales, UK, may have been caused by a tsunami.\n\n[edit]\n1700 - Vancouver Island, Canada\nJanuary 26 - The Cascadia Earthquake, one of the largest earthquakes on record, ruptures the Cascadia Subduction Zone offshore from Vancouver Island to northern California, creating a tsunami logged in Japan and oral traditions of the Native Americans.\n\n[edit]\n1755 - Lisbon, Portugal\nTens of thousands of Portuguese who survived the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake were killed by a tsunami which followed a half hour later. Many townspeople fled to the waterfront, believing the area safe from fires and from falling debris from aftershocks. Before the great wall of water hit the harbour, waters retreated, revealing lost cargo and forgotten shipwrecks.\n\nThe earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent fires killed more than a third of Lisbon's pre-quake population of 275,000. Historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators were lost, and countless buildings were destroyed (including most examples of Portugal's Manueline architecture). Europeans of the 18th century struggled to understand the disaster within religious and rational belief systems. Philosophers of the Enlightenment, notably Voltaire, wrote about the event. The philosophical concept of the sublime, as described by philosopher Immanuel Kant in the Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, took inspiration in part from attempts to comprehend the enormity of the Lisbon quake and tsunami.\n\n[edit]\n1883 - Krakatoa explosive eruption\nThe island volcano of Krakatoa in Indonesia exploded with devastating fury in 1883, blowing its underground magma chamber partly empty so that much overlying land and seabed collapsed into it. A series of large tsunami waves was generated from the explosion, some reaching a height of over 40 metres above sea level. Tsunami waves were observed throughout the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the American West Coast, South America, and even as far away as the English Channel. On the facing coasts of Java and Sumatra the sea flood went many miles inland and caused such vast loss of life that one area was never resettled but went back to the jungle and is now the Ujung Kulon nature reserve.\n\n The aftermath of the tsunami that struck Newfoundland in 1929.[edit]\n1929 - Newfoundland tsuna",6227
6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

Here is what I did, and maybe it will work for you...Up your cardio by an extra 15 minutes and hit the floor for some serious sit-ups. And don't forget to modify the number of carbohydrates and sweets you are eating. Sugar (from both sweets and fruit) turns into the same thing in your body as carbs, meaning that you have to be careful with how much of that sort of stuff you are eating. Cut out all white and enriched flours and starchy products.

9,"Why is there no talk by the newly elected Democrats to reopen a 9/11 investigation? ; There are so may questions surrounding the official 9/11 story that I wonder why the newly elected Democrats are not promising to reopen the investigation. From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars. The victims of 9/11 have also embraced them. \n\nBelow are some links to some films that will enlighten you on the subject. \n\nWarning: if you have your mind made up that the government holds no responsibility whatsoever and if you unconditionally defend those in power despite overwhelming evidence that proves otherwise, don't bother clicking below. Your patriotism is the cheapest and weakest one possible. It is the type that never questions authority, a direct opposition to what the founding fathers urged all of us to do when they drafted the Constitution. \n\nLaugh, scoff, or give thumbs down if you are weak in this regard. \n\nIf you are strong, truly patriotic, and willing to face the truth no matter how painful, and if you have some time to spare, click the links below. Or at least add to favorites for future viewing. \n\nIf you are convinced ny viewing this evidence that suggests 9/11 needs further investigation, then urge your Congressional Reps and Senators to re-open 9/11.

Is the intention to make the point that since entropy is a thermodynamic property of the system, if the entropy of state 1 is s1 and that of state 2 is s2, then the entropy difference is s2-s1, regardless of how one transits between the states?

Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.

And a power source for all those parts requiring an electrical impulse.  \nThe procedures used usually try to remove power from the overall device, if that is not possible, try to prevent the electrical impulse from making it to the trigger or detonator.  If all else fails, take the device somewhere that will cause minimal damage and blow it up in a controlled setting...sorry if this means eliminating the hostage.",6586

3,"Who is nalson mandela? ; i need info byt the second of may ; Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was Chief Henry Mandela of the Tembu Tribe. Mandela himself was educated at University College of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand and qualified in law in 1942. He joined the African National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against the ruling National Party's apartheid policies after 1948. He went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was acquitted in 1961.\n\nAfter the banning of the ANC in 1960, Nelson Mandela argued for the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. In June 1961, the ANC executive considered his proposal on the use of violent tactics and agreed that those members who wished to involve themselves in Mandela's campaign would not be stopped from doing so by the ANC. This led to the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with hard labour. In 1963, when many fellow leaders of the ANC and the Umkhonto we Sizwe were arrested, Mandela was brought to stand trial with them for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. His statement from the dock received considerable international publicity. On June 12, 1964, eight of the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor Prison, nearby on the mainland.\n\nDuring his years in prison, Nelson Mandela's reputation grew steadily. He was widely accepted as the most significant black leader in South Africa and became a potent symbol of resistance as the anti-apartheid movement gathered strength. He consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom.\n\nNelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. After his release, he plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life's work, striving to attain the goals he and others had set out almost four decades earlier. In 1991, at the first national conference of the ANC held inside South Africa after the organization had been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected President of the ANC while his lifelong friend and colleague, Oliver Tambo, became the organisation's National Chairperson.",6849
6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds. Also, be sure to balance this investment with some equity (stock) investments to give you diversification. Good luck!",6852
0,"Do you think this helps to prove the point Jehovas Witness are a cult? ; When you study with the Jehovah's Witness, you agree to attend five meetings a week where you are taught from Watchtower literature.  You cannot be baptized until you have studied their material for at least six months and have answered numerous questions before a panel of elders.   Men are not supposed have long hair or wear beards and women are to dress in modest apparel.  They refuse to vote, salute the flag, sing the ""Star Spangled Banner, celebrate birthdays or Christmas, won't take blood transfusions, and they can't join the armed forces.  A schedule of door-to-door canvassing is required where you distribute the Watchtower literature, acquire donations, and forward all monies to the headquarters in Brooklyn, New York.\n     If you ever leave the Jehovah's Witness organization, you are considered an apostate and are to be shunned. ; groups like the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses object to the label ""cult"" because it often gets an emotional reaction as well as is a label they want to avoid.\n   The definition I use (and other Christian ministries and theologians use as well) for ""non-Christian cult"" or ""non-Christian religion"" is a group that may or may not include the Bible in its set of authoritative scriptures. If it does include the Bible, it distorts the true biblical doctrines that effect salvation sufficiently so as to void salvation.1  If it doesn't use the Bible, it is a non-Christian religion and does not participate in the benefit of divine revelation.\n     In Christian bookstores, there are almost always 'cult' sections which include the Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, etc.",6853

I think thats mainly because mine is a stronger bike (he just rides his around time sometimes, he is a good skateboarder) but i was just wondering if ther was something i could do for around $70 or lower (I spent most of my extra cash on the bike) to make it a little lighter or preform better. Thanks for any advice. ; Hey whats up dude im glad to see you stuck with the Haro and  got it, If it has the heavy gauge steel pegs you can lighten up a little bit by takin those off and trying to find lighter ones, You can also try to find an aluminum seatpost to replace the one that came on it but make sure the one on it isnt aluminum already. Haro makes their bikes heavier nowadays but they are well made and once you get to know the bike it will be much easier to manuever. You can look for lighter handlebars as well but if you do, before you buy them make sure to take yours off first and weight them ,or take them with you when you goto get the new ones and with one in each hand determine which pair is heavier.\nI also have Free agent and it is a bit lighter than a couple of my haros but Ive been a haro buyer since 1985 and I'd never ever change the name of my favorite brand...Haro",6857

5,"have you seen the finalists for bbc sports personality of the year 2006....not a single footballer on there ? ; apparently the finalists are as folllows: jenson button (f1), joe calzaghe (boxing), darren clarke (golf), nicole cooke (cycling), ricky hatton (boxing), andy murray (tennis), monty panesar (cricket), zara phillips (equestrian), phil taylor (darts) and beth tweddle (gymnastics).\n\nwhat do you make of this selection? should a footballer be nominated for an award? if so, who would you give it to and why, in relation to their performances on the pitch? if not, why not? are footballers overrated in comparison to athletes of other sports? are you pleased that not a single football player is on the shortlist?\nwho or what is to blame for the demise in standards during and within the game, with events occuring on and off the pitch? and even as important, as football is shunned from the limelight in this instance of the sports personality of the year awards ceremony, do you consider it as more or less significant in your eyes?\n\ni still enjoy the game, but i believe it has lost its way recently ; I think this is a great selection if correct, especially as our local newspaper in Stoke-on-Trent has been lobbying for Phil Taylor's nomination!\n\nI can't think of a British footballer who would merit a nomination this year given England's appalling performance in the World Cup and British club's lack of success in Europe last season.\n\nYes I think footballers are over-rated in comparison to other sports, but they usually dominate these kind of awards because of the huge media exposure given to football.\n\nThe cause of the demise in the game can be traced directly to the amount of money now awash in the game, which has led to a ""win at all costs"" attitude, and also players who, to put it bluntly, have more money than sense.\n\nThe awards are not devalued for me in any way by no footballer making the final shortlist: it's great that Ricky Hatton and Joe Calzaghe have been recognised, along with Phil Taylor who is undisputably the best ever at his profession.  Credit also to Beth Tweddle as she has something no-one can ever take away from her - Britain's first ever world champion in her sport.  Top marks also to Nicole Cooke for overcoming horrendous injuries when she was knocked off her bike whilst training and going on to win the year-long World Cup.  My two quibbles would be Jensen Button (only won one Grand Prix) and Zara Phillips - like Formula 1 it doesn't matter how good the driver/rider is if the car/horse isn't good enough.

And what did those things evolve from? If you believe the Big Bang theory, what/who put the very first particles in place to combine and form the world as we know it?\n\nThis is a very serious question to me, because I am not religous, I do believe in those ideas of our evolution, however, that question leaves me to rely entirely on my spiritual beliefs, that there MUST be something else. Something powerful enough to plant the tiniest seed to grow all of life from. Am I missing some information? ; I think your on the right track my friend, but just expand your thinking a little bit on this subject. One of the most interesting theories I've heard about this subject comes from a book ""Stalking the Wild Pendulum""- (written by a self taught Astrophysicist!)It asserts that where there is matter there is consciousness and where there is consciousness there is an aspect of ""God""  Rather then God having a self encapsulated ego, god can be thought of all that is and all that is not.  This is often referred to as the ""god head"" or the ""Prime Mover.""  There may be some unification between the belief in God and in Evolution.  ""God"" emerged from the void realized ""Himself"" through ""His"" creation and then returned to the void.\nIn terms of your question regarding Homo Sapiens- our predecessors didn't evolve from the apes- although prehistoric man was ""ape-like""  Homo Erectus started to use tools to break open bones for the fat rich marrow inside to feed a very large and developing brain.  Apparently big brains require lots of energy!  The brain of our strain of primates distinguished themselves by all that Grey matter up there, unlike our ""ape"" cousins.",6902

If you're pissed off about illegal immigration, fine, do something about it: start fining companies that hire illegals huge fines, and the illegal job market will dry up. If you're worried that people don't understand English and won't be able to find a job, then offer free or low-cost English classes at various times and on various days in neighbordhoods where there are lots of immigrants. But stop throwing fits about the fact that some people are able to communicate in TWO languages and choose the language in which they communicate at any point in time based on the context. \n\nGeez...Is it ridiculous to ask for a LITTLE tolerance and common sense?\n\nTO Bluffmike: Dude, your argument makes no sense. So you're saying that in order to avoid becoming like the Chinese, who were able to employ xenophobic, intolerant troops to squelch liberty by killing the protesting Hans, whom they disliked, we should become more intolerant and xenophobic. Does that not seem a little contradictory to you? No, no, no, if we want to avoid the path of the Chinese, we need to encourage TOLERANCE not intolerance.\n\nTo Concerned: Actually, plenty of Americans do move to China and expect to be spoken to in English. My ex-husband travels there all the time and may be transferred there next year. He speaks very little Chinese.

1,"Is bipedal walking the most difficult thing to do for a human ? ; If bipedal walking was easy why are robots not able to walk in a bipedal manner. Since bipedal walking can be done only by humans  on this planet, it is the most difficult thing to learn and can be learnt only through evolution. Am I thinking right ? ; It's not the most difficult.  Look at how fast babies learn to walk compared to how fast they learn to talk.\n\nI read once that humans are the only bipedal mammal with no tail.  Kangaroos are bipedal (with tail) of course they don't walk.\n\nI would say it depends on the brain we are talking about: it's the simplest thing in the world for a large herbivore to walk, they do it within minutes of being born, predators can't walk for weeks.\n\nFor humans, maybe speech or higher cognitive skills are harder than walking.\n\nAs for robots, I don't know why they need to be bipedal, it is a very awkward and unsteady form of locomotion. I would say they will eventually be able to do it quite well, but we could be working on other things like AI instead.",7028

Those on death row have hurt innocent people, families, children and society. What acts has an unborn child committed to deserve the fate of being aborted. \n\nThis is a perfect example of how liberals are on the wrong side of issues. Liberals will claim that abortion is a right to privacy issue - the so called, ""it is my body and I can do with it what I wish"". Well- a person cannot do whatever they wish with their body if it effects me. You cannot take your fist (which is part of your body) and punch me in the face. A person has the right to privacy in their home, but that does not extend to activities which are illegal. Your rights end where my rights begin. A heart beats at less than 4 weeks. Isn't a heart beat the final determinat ; I know you don't actually want an answer - you seem more interested in pontificating.  Be that as it may, it is perfectly easy to justify a belief in the legality of abortion vs. the legality of the death penalty.  For me, capital punishment is a governmental rights issue - that is, I do not believe the government has the right to deprive its citizens of life under any circumstances.  It's simply something the government should not be allowed to do, because allowing it for some people (odious though they may be) makes it easier to apply it for lesser crimes - a slippery slope argument, essentially.\n\nAbortion is a different issue, because (1) it is not the government depriving someone of life; (2) there's no scientific reason to argue that life begins at conception; and (3) if we assume life begins at conception, then all laws regarding children would apply to zygotes/fetuses, which would be unworkable in any society.",7165

Legislation is suppossed to be done entirely by the Congress. ; This problem started back during the first term of the F.D.R. Administration. F.D.R. was attempting to push through his ""New Deal"" legislation and the Supreme Court was striking down pieces of legislation left and right because they were not within the enumerated powers of the federal goverment.\n\nF.D.R.'s solution to this little problem was to threaten to pack the court with justices who would vote the way he wanted. Back then there was no constitutionally stipulated maximum to the number of justices that could be put on the court so long as the president nominated them and the Senate gave their consent.\n\nWith this very real threat in place, the High Court backed down, and ever since we have essentially had no limit on the powers of the federal government.\n\nThis is the single greatest threat to our country.

1,"One question regarding evolution: What blew up in the Big Bang and where did it come from? Eternal matter? ; So do you BELIEVE IN eternal matter, or an ETERNAL GOD?  The key word in both cases is BELIEVE.  Yes, like it or not, Evolution IS a system of belief. ; The Big Bang \n\nAbout fifty years ago, American astronomers studying the galactic star clusters, stumbled on evidence that the entire Universe is blowing up before our eyes. According to their observations, all the galaxies in the Universe are moving away from us and from one another at very high speeds, and the most distant are receding at the extraordinary speed of hundreds of millions of miles an hour.\n\nFirst there was nothing and it blew up and then there was everything and scientists have calculated that it all happened in 1043 of a second. [The] echo of that explosion can still be heard bouncing around in space. Scientists claim that in the big bang all of the fundamental particles necessary for life were formed. All of the complexity we see around us is the result of this massive explosion.\n\n""The new finding hit the scientific world like a thunderclap."" It meant that the idea of an ultimate beginning was no longer merely religious dogma. Science itself now indicated that the universe burst into existence at a particular time in the remote past.\n\nIn 1992 measurements by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and by the Hubble Space Telescope seemed to confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that the Big Bang cosmology is indeed correct. George Smoot, Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and Principle Investigator of the COBE team which made the discovery, said regarding these new observations, ""What we have found is evidence for the birth of the universe . . . It's like looking at God.""\n\nWorking backwards, the evidence implies that there was a time when the universe was infinitesimally small. The evidence from general relativity also indicates that it was not merely a case of the matter in the universe being concentrated at a particular location, but that space itself was this tiny. At a sudden instant in time all of the energy and mass in the universe was located at this infinitesimally small point and exploded. The currently observed outbound motion of the galaxies from each other is a continuing effect of that explosion.\n\n""The scientific community is prepared to consider the idea that God created the universe is a more respectable hypothesis today than at any time in the last 100 years,"" Frederic B. Burnham, science historian, declared.\n\nHowever, some die-hard secularists propose that the universe goes through endless cycles of expansions and collapses. Hence, eternity becomes nothing more than an eternal succession of big bangs followed by big crunches followed by big bangs followed by big crunches over and over again and again forever.\n\nBut this violates the second law of thermodynamics, the law of decay, that implies that the universe is in a process of gradual disintegration - running down, like a wound-up clock. And if it is running down, then there must have been a time when it was wound up. Once the big bang takes place and the universe begins its expansion, entropy starts to increase. From this point on it will never be able to go back to its original state.\n\nWhat's more, the first law of thermodynamics (the conservation of matter) implies that matter cannot just pop into existence or create itself. And therefore, if the universe had a beginning, then something external to the universe must have caused it to come into existence - something, or Someone, transcendent to the natural world.\n\nThe facts clearly indicate that the universe is not eternal, and it cannot originate itself The implication is that the universe began at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy. Science has begun to sound eerily like Genesis 1: ""And God said, 'Let there be light""' (1:3).\n\nThe evidence requires that we believe God formed the universe at His command, pointing to the importance of taking God at His word literally - from the beginning both of time and the Bible. Second, there is such a striking parallel between the Hebrews 1",7383

8,"Guys-- why is the idea of having sex with two girls pleasurable? ; My BF told me before he could have sex with two girls- one of them being me of course.  But I cannot stand the thought of watching him having sex with another girl. This bothers me especially after vowing with each other we wouldn't have sex with other people.  Is this a product of his porn watching and wanting to experience new things? I think I give him plenty of sex and good sex too. I don't understand... ; Ok, I have to say that a lot of the answers that you have received so far are close, but none of them quite hit the mark or cover all the bases, so I am going to see what I can do here. \n First of all, I am fairly qualified here as my fiancé and I have done a threesome with both another woman and another guy, and our relationship has survived it unscathed. \n To answer the main question of why. . . There is no single answer that would apply to all men that have those desires. Yes, porn for a lot of us has glorified the threesome. Another common reason is that watching two women be intimate is quite erotic. Lets face it, they call you the ""fairer sex"" for a reason!!\n Could your BF feel pressure to please you? If so, a second person could be viewed as a helper.\n The most common reason, however, is simply the desire to have variety in ones sex life.\n Now, let's address how you should go forward. First of all, your BF shared a fantasy with you, and if you ever want him to ever do so again, you cannot react negatively to it. That does not mean that you have to do it, but you also want to avoid him feeling rejection from it.\n To help you decide if having a threesome with another woman is something you want to do, consider this:\n Are you physically attracted to women? I.E. Are you bi/bi-curious? If so, you could decide that you are will have a threesome with him with the stipulation that he and the other woman do not have sex. Set very specific boundaries, I.E. Is touching ok? Is kissing ok? Is manual stimulation ok? Etc. . . If you cannot trust him to abide by these boundaries during the heat of the moment, you do NOT want to do this!\n If you decide that you do not want to do this, explain it to him, but offer to incorporate it into your fantasy life. Say something to him like ""The idea turns me on, but I would not be ok with the reality of it"", and then bring it up in a sexy way during foreplay or lovemaking. Reiterate after you are done having sex that this is something that can only be a fantasy, never a reality. This is often the perfect compromise in these situations.\n In my experience, a man bringing this fantasy to his significant other is generally sign of developing trust, and not of impending doom. The act itself, however, has been the end of many strong relationships, so tread carefully!!",7395

I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

3,"where can i find the history of nachos? ; i'm  doin a report on them and none of the search sites give me what i want!!! ; BY KAREN HARAM SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS-NEWS A fried tostado. Yellow cheese. A slice of jalapeno. So simple. So delicious. So monumental. Back in 1943, Ignacio ""Nacho"" assembled the first he had no idea that 60 years later, this appetizer would have made his nickname a household word. At that time, the senior Anaya was working at a restaurant owned by Rudolfo De Los Santos, the Victory Club in Piedras Negras, Mexico, just across the border from Eagle Pass, says his son Ignacio Anaya Jr. of Eagle Pass. As Anaya Jr. recalls the story, Mamie Finan and a group of 10 to 12 officers' wives, whose husbands were stationed at Fort Duncan Air Base, traveled across the border to eat at the Victory Club. When the senior Anaya couldn't find. the cook, he went into action. ""My father was maitre d' and he said 'Let me go quick and fix something for you.' He went into the kitchen, picked up tostados,' grated some cheese on them - Wisconsin cheese, the round one - and put them under the Salamander (a broiling unit that quickly browns the top of foods). He pulled them out after a couple minutes, all melted, and put on a slice of jalapeno."" - The name of the snack, Anaya Jr. says, came from Finan, who called the plate of cheese- and chile-topped chips Nacho's Especiales. The name was later shortened to simply ""nachos."" Anaya Sr. went on to work at the Moderno, which is still in business today, as well as his own Nacho's Restaurant in Piedras Negras. In 1960, Anaya Jr. looked into helping his father, who died in 1975, claim ownership of the nacho. ""I talked to a lawyer in San Antonio. He said there's not much you can do after 17 years. It's in the public domain,"" Anaya Jr. says. As a tribute to his father, Anaya Jr. serves as a judge for an annual nacho competition held in Piedras Niegras me second weekend each October. There, nachos are topped with everything from huitlacoche to caviar. But his favorite remains the original nachos like his father made, though he gives high marks to beef and chicken nachos topped with guacamole. ""That's a whole meal,"" he says. Anaya Sr.'s granddaughter, Cristina de Los Santos of San Antonio, says her grandfather died when she was in elementary school. But she remembers the leg-end of Nacho, and his nachos, as family lore. ""When I was little, my family would always tell me the story,"" she says. Better yet, when she would go to her grandfather's restaurant in Piedras Negras, he would make nachos for her. ""I didn't like cheese. He always made me bean nachos,"" she says. De Los Santos says her father, Anaya Jr., like her grandfather, ""makes nachos real good. He makes them the original way."" Though she doesn't have a recipe, she describes the process as follows: Tortilla chips, cut in triangles, are fried in what she calls shortening, not oil. The fried chips are salted, then topped with yellow cheese. The chips are run under the broiler, then topped with a slice of jalapeno. Although she's a fan of many types of nachos and occasionally orders them when dining out, the ones she gets today taste far different from those her grandfather made. ""The chips are different,"" she says. ""They're not homemade chips like he used to do. Or maybe it's the hands of the chef."" \nNow here is where the story gets even better. The tasty snack becomes a specialty in many restaurants in Southern Texas but is virtually unknown anywhere else on the planet. That is until a gentleman by the name of Frank Liberto decided to try to sell the stuff as a concession stand item! He changed up the recipe by reformulating the cheese to be soft all the time and using simple tortilla chips. He began to sell his new version of nachos in 1977 in Arlington Stadium in Arlington Texas. but what really made the concept take off was a visit by ""Monday Night Football"" later that year.

As the infant suckles, the posterior pituary is triggered to produce oxytocin.  Oxytocin is responsible for the milk ejection reflex.

He seemed uncomfortable and embarrassed by the ovation. President Clinton is a humble, down-to-earth, non-assuming gentleman. He is charming, funny, and easy to talk to. No wonder Hillary loves him.",7530

4,"what is DD-RAM? ; answer my question plz... ; I dont know if You mean DVD-RAM\n\nA dvd is a digital video/versatile disk and RAM is Random Access Memory.\nThe DVD-RAM format is based on PD-RW (Phase-Differential) drives, and actually uses a cartridge to hold the media (just like its PD-RW predecessor). Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are). The Plextor PX-504U is an example of an external DVD+R/+RW drive capable of recording single layer discs in the +R/+RW format, but also able to read discs recorded by a DVD-R drive.",7559
4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

As you look down at anearby smaller buidling, you observe that the angle of depression of the base is 77 degrees and the angle of depression of the top is 46 degrees.  Find the hegiht of the smaller building and the horizontal distance between the two buildings. ; Trigonometry is hard to do in you head, so start out by making a drawing. You have two buildings A (tall) and B (short) - Draw them far apart, not like this:\n\nA         B\n|         \n|         \n|    \n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n\nNow draw one line from the top of A to the top of B - this is the angle of depression of the top and it is 46 degrees. That is, if you drew a straight, horizontal line across the top of building A, the angle between that line and the line joining the top of A to the top of B is 46 degress.\n\nSimilarly, draw a line from the top of A to the *bottom* of B - this is the angle of depression of the bottom and it is 77 degrees. That is, the angle between the horizontal line across the top of A, and the line between top of A and bottom of B is 77 degrees.\n\nNow can you find out the angle between the line from A-top to B-top, and the line from A-top to B-bottom? (It's very important for you to draw this!) Let's put this value aside for a minute. \n\nLooking at your drawing, can you see that you know the value for *part* of the angle between the horizontal line across A's top and length of building A? What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom. Solve this triangle for line A-bottom to B-bottom for distance between the two buildings.\nTriangle 2: A-top to B-top to B-bottom. Solve this triangle for line B-top to B-bottom for height of building. \n\nDon't forget, we have two important angles that will help solve these two triangles!",7575

Such as Choloroform(CHCl3), Na2SO4, KCl, and BaSo4\n\nI would greatly appreciate anyone's help with this! ; We've to get this clear first. Water is a polar solvent, gasoline is a non-polar solvent. By the principal of like-dissolves-like, polar molecules will dissolve in water, for example, NaCl; while non-polar molecules will dissolve in gasoline, for example, fats, phosholipids, alkanes, alkenes etc.\n\nFor the question you've asked,\nChloroform is a polar compund because Cl draws electrons from the carbon center and making Cl atoms have a higher concerntration of electrons. Hydrogen atoms in water carry a partially positive charge and hence are attracted to Cl molecule. Hence it is soluble in water.\n\nNa2SO4 is soluble in water. This is because it is actually 2 Na+ ions attached to SO4(2-) ions. Na+ ions get attracted to oxygen atoms in water which has a partially negative charge and SO4(2-) ions gets attracted to hydrogen atoms in water which has a partially positive charge.\n\nKCL is soluble in water because Cl atoms draws electrons from K. Follow the same reasoning as chloroform.\n\nFor BaSO4, it is insoluble in water. Only barium nitrate dissolves in water. Other barium salts do not.\n\nHope this helps! =)",7637

Yes war also means death to innocent people and harm and danger to the good forces who fight for the pure cause.

I am interested in a field that creates the necessary software required to make computers work, like operating systems, and am really confused about the fields I mentioned above. I just want to know their differences so that I can decide which field to pursue.\n\nThank You for your help ; In many markets the terms programmer and software engineer are used interchangeably.\n\nTechincally, a Software Engineer is someone who has a degree in Computer Science (usually from an engineering college). A software engineer studies programming, system architecture, database theory, and other computer-related topics. \n\nA person who possesses these same skills, even without such a degree, and who has worked for a period of time in this role might also be called a software engineer. It is up to the hirer to determine if this person has the necessarey skills.  Often, proven industry experience is enough. This is why job requirements often read ""Software Engineer Wanted - BS or MS in Computer Science or 8+ years demonstrated experience"".\n\nA Computer Programmer is someone that knows how to write programs in a specific language. He/she may or may not have the systems architecture, operating systems, and database training and skills that a Software Engineer has. And those skills may not be required. \n\nThere is no such common title as Computer Engineer in the US. This is typically what someone who does not understand the business mught call someone in the business. Ex. ""My nephew is a computer engineer"" conveys that the nephew is in the business but does actually describe the role.",7855

1,"Can Newton gravitational constant be equal to Space curvature/stress energy momentum tensor? ; Is it correctly derived from Einstein's field equation? ; no. \nthe stress-energy tensor tells us how the energy is spread, and moves, across spacetime.\nthe gravitational constant is a parameter that determines to what degree 1 kg of mass (for instance) will ""warp"" the spacetime. \n\nso, you can't derive it from the einstein equation.\n\nin fact, relativists usually set the gravitational constant to = 1, so that they don't have to deal with it. although it's essential when you're trying to determine exactly what your physical predictions will be, it's not really an active element of einstein's theory. it just kind of sits there.",7946

6,"How could the US currency collapse overnight, either realistically or unrealistically? ; Excluding terrorism or natural disasters. Also, would a stock market crash cause the dollar to collapse? If so, what scenario is needed for the US stock market to crash overnight like in 1929? ; The dollar is not directly linked to the stock market. It is a strong currency in that many developing countries, including China, stockpile dollars to give them some ""hard currency"" strength. The danger is really the longer-term decline of the dollar versus other ""hard currencies"" such as the euro and yen. The dollar is also strengthened by its ties to various commodities, such as oil, which is denominated in dollars. If Russia and the Middle East countries begin selling oil to Europe or China for euros or gold dinars in a big way, then the dollar would lose more of that stability. Inflation and investors' currency speculation are additional variables. But it is unlikely that the dollar would crash overnight, because those that you might think would benefit from this (such as China) would actually lose billions and billions overnight if all their dollar holdings lost huge value. Longterm erosion in the dollar value is much more likely.",8259

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you.

1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity. This is it.",8397

The Bible does say that no greater love has any man than to lay down his life for another.  Taking that and looking at organ donation, I think that God would be very pleased that we would give our useless organs to another to save their lives.  What use do we have with them if we are dead?  It serves a greater good to help another and if God says that the greatest love is to lay our lives down for another, giving life when our lives are gone seems almost redundant...of course we should.

9,"British/American Politics? ; In Britain the Tory Party represents Big Business, the Labour Party says it represents the People(Debatable) And the Liberals can't make there minds up, what's the equivalent in America?. ; Good question. Anerican politics can be very complicated.\n\nGenerally, the Republican Party can be seen as the equivalent to the ""Tories"", the Democratic Party can be seen as the equivalent to Labour, although the American spectrum is a little bit more to the right. From what I've heard about the modern Liberal party, they are probably equivalent to Libertarians- although it's hard to peg your Liberal party down on the political spectrum.\n\nBut until the 1960's, it wasn't that cut and dry. The Democrats had many Conservatives in the south and elsewhere. And the Republicans had many liberals/moderates in the Northeast. The Republicans, after all, were the ones who freed the slaves during the Civil War. The Democrats, as a matter of fact, encouraged the formation of the KKK as a means of intimidating republicans(most of the Republicans in the south after the civil war were black ).\n\nBut even with those contradictions, the Democrats have almost always been perceived as more of ""the people's party"" and the Republicans have been more of a ""Pro-Business"" party.\n\nAs I said, the 60's and the Nixon ""Southern Strategy"" sort of caused a realignment. Conservatives moved to the GOP(Republican party) and liberals moved to the Democrats- although the seeds of this were already in each party, and there had been a slow drift both ways throughout the 20th century.",8446

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602
1,"what is ""maxwell's deamon""? ; it may be related to James Clerk Maxwell or physics (perhaps electromagnetism) ; Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment. Take a room full of ordinary air at a temperature of, say, 300 kelvin. Now, 300 kelvin means that the molecules of the air are moving with a certain speed - the faster they move, the hotter it is. Well, not all molecules in the room are moving with the same speed. Some of them are faster (""hotter"") and some are slower (""colder""). What Maxwell's demon is apparently capable of doing is sort all the fast molecules into one end of the room and all the slow ones into the other end, thus making an oven in one end and a freezer in the other! What Maxwell's point about this is that this can't be done without expending more energy than is gained by this ordering of thermal energy.

3,"What were 3 main causes of the civil war?? ; I have a test tomorrow in social studies! ; The Civil War was caused by a myriad of conflicting pressures, principles, and prejudices, fueled by sectional differences and pride, and set into motion by a most unlikely set of political events.\n\nAt the root of all of the problems was the institution of slavery, which had been introduced into North America in early colonial times. The American Revolution had been fought to validate the idea that all men were created equal, yet slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies throughout the revolutionary period. Although it was largely gone from the northern states by 1787, it was still enshrined in the new Constitution of the United States, not only at the behest of the Southern ones, but also with the approval of many of the Northern delegates who saw that there was still much money to be made in the slave trade by the Yankee shipping industry. Eventually its existence came to color every aspect of American life.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention there were arguments over slavery. Representatives of the Northern states claimed that if the Southern slaves were mere property, then they should not be counted toward voting representation in Congress. Southerners, placed in the difficult position of trying to argue, at least in this case, that the slaves were human beings, eventually came to accept the three-fifths compromise, by which five slaves counted as three free men toward that representation. By the end of the convention the institution of slavery itself, though never specifically mentioned, was well protected within the body of the Constitution.\n\nIt seemed to Thomas Jefferson and many others that slavery was on its way out, doomed to die a natural death. It was becoming increasingly expensive to keep slaves in the agrarian society of the south. Northern and Southern members of Congress voted together to abolish the importation of slaves from overseas in 1808, but the domestic slave trade continued to flourish. The invention of the cotton gin made the cultivation of cotton on large plantations using slave labor a profitable enterprise in the deep South. The slave became an ever more important element of the southern economy, and so the debate about slavery, for the southerner, gradually evolved into an economically based question of money and power, and ceased to be a theoretical or ideological issue at all. It became an institution that southerners felt bound to protect.\n\nBut even as the need to protect it grew, the ability, or at least the perceived ability of the South to do so was waning. Southern leaders grew progressively more sensitive to this condition. In 1800 half of the population of the United States had lived in the South. But by 1850 only a third lived there and the disparity continued to widen. While northern industrial opportunity attracted scores of immigrants from Europe in search of freedom the South's population stagnated. Even as slave states were added to the Union to balance the number of free ones, the South found that its representatives in the House had been overwhelmed by the North’s explosive growth. More and more emphasis was now placed on maintaining parity in the Senate. Failing this, the paranoid theory went, the South would find itself at the mercy of a government in which it no longer had an effective voice. Never mind that slavery was protected under the constitution, and that it would have been impossible to make amendments to abolish it. Jefferson Davis, at the time a Senator from Mississippi, summed up the sectionalist argument himself. Speaking, in effect, to the people of the North concerning slavery, “It is not humanity that influences you… it is that you may have a majority in the Congress of the United States and convert the Government into an engine of Northern aggrandizement… you want by an unjust system of legislation to promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.” There, in plain English, is the shrill, accusat",8670

1,"Are we really unable to see what we cannot conceive? ; Recently watched, ""What the Bleep do We Know"", and it really left me wondering.

4,"What is the safest way to backup your digital photos ? ; Should I use DVD-R, external harddrives ... what will secure my photos 20 years from now when I want to look at photos of my kids growing up ? ; Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Hard drives have a MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) bascially this means that they will fail within a certain time or at least produce bad sectors making some of your data unrecoverable(ish). One way to try to protect data on your PC is to have a RAIDED system that means 2 or more identical drives and hardware or software replicates the software across each drive so if one drive goes down you still have your data. This does not help if the PC goes on fire or gets water damaged, you should always have a seperate backup procedure.\n\n2. DVD's are a good way of backing up your data and I would say are a more reliable way of backing up rather than Hard disks but they are limited to 4.7GB (single sided). What I do is burn a backup every week or whenever I do a big change of data but this is dependant on the old saying ""What happens if your Hard Disk died in 5 minutes would you miss any data on it"" if yes do a daily Backup. 99% of IT companies only backup there data every day so backing up every few hours is a bit extreme but again if it is critical do a backup. Buy quality DVD's!\n\n3. USB memory sticks are pretty tough bits of kit and you can give them quite a bit of grief before they fail, USB sticks use memory chips rather than magnetic media like hard disks and tend to be a little bit more robust. They can get corrupted just like any other device.\n\n4. Zip disks are a bit old hat and have the same problem as floppy disks avoid avoid avoid! Trust me I have used them and relied too much on them and lost data cos of it.\n\n5. Tape backups (DDS3/4/DAT72) have a good capacity and alot of IT companies use this type of backup but again they are suseptable to corruption similar to floppy disks if kept for any length of time as they are magnetic media, expensive to maintain.\n\n6. SD/MMC cards are similar technology to USB memory sticks as they store the data on a chip(s) but do not normally have the capacity to store alot of data (1GB?) and are very easily lost/broken as they are so small.\n\n7. Online backups are an option but most are insecure and do you want people to have access to your data/photos etc. hmmmm\n\nI suppose there is no 100% safe way of backing up your data (and keeping it safe) but I have found DVD's to be pretty good (using quality DVD's with dark ink), I use DVD-RW as my data changes alot and there is no point in me keeping the old stuff but buy high quality DVD's as cheap and nasty DVD's tend to develop problems later in life.\nI have seen alot of testing done on USB sticks and they have been found to be very tough to break.\n\nIf you are serious about the data you can buy a small fire proof safe as well.\n\nJust my opinon and experience!",8709

Are you asking if somone could get into more trouble than normal for not paying their debt when it's in the hundereds of thousands, verus let's say someone with only a few thousands dollars debt?\n\nDebt is debt is debt.  If you take out a credit card, no matter what your credit limit is, you're supposed to pay it back according to the terms of the credit card company.  If you don't, the credit card company has a couple of different options.  For a small amount, they could simply write the debt off on their taxes at the end of the year and forget it.  Or, they could sell the debt to someone else, and the someone else could try to collect it (phone calls, letters, etc).  In either case, it's probably going to show up on your credit report, and your credit would suffer the normal 7 years.  In some cases, these ""debt buyers"" post the debt as of the day they buy it, and it could stay on your credit for alot longer than just 7 years.\n\nThe credit card company could also take you to small claims court (depending on how much you owe and what the limit for your state is) and get a judgment.  Here's where things get tricky.  If the credit card company wins in small claims, they could (1) take money out of your bank account (2) garnish your wages (3) they could take any of your personal property that isn't considered ""exempt"" in your state (car, RV, motorcycle, etc) or (4) if there's enough debt, they could call for a foreclosure on your home.

6,"CAPM in China? ; Hello,\nIm writing a paper why the CAPM doesn`t work in CHina. I need a mathematical example with the simple CAPM-equation to show it. I don`t know what I should use as the riskfree rate. So my question is whar should I use and do you know a good example or other reasons why it doesnt work? ; First of all the extension of the original CAPM(Sharpe, Mossin,\nLintner in 1963) is termed the International CAPM or ICAPM.\nTo use it in china you need a beta for the stock or for a portolio of \nstocks which will be difficult for some of the newly formed \nChinese publically traded corporations.  Another factor is the\nstock market in China is an emerging market hence it suffers from a general lack of history and liquidity though expectation is that it will grow rapidly in the future.  \n\nThe model would be:R stock = risk free rate+Beta (Rmarket-RF)\n\n  Now in the literature it is common to use either the \nU.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the U.S. Long Bond Rate. As \nRoll's critique aptly pointed out there is no truely riskless asset\nso we have used the above surrogates. Not a bad choice though since the data on them is readily available through the U.S. \nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which issues these debt \nobligations through the Fed has never defaulted on any obligations.  Further the marke is the largest most liquid debt \nmarket in the world which has investors from around the world and foreign governments buying and selling these assets \ncontinuously.   \n\nSo, next we address the matter of a market index surrogate\nto use in the right hand terms.  Since we can't really use the \nChinese swtock market Index as a true surrogate for the \nworld market index we must make one.  Assuming there is \nadequate capital market integration today to allow us to do so.\nIn the literature some have use a weighted average composite\nconsisting ofweights determined by the relative market values \nof equity traded on the diverse major wold bourses(Stock Markets).  For example the portion of equity traded in the NY\nStock market weighted by an index like the S& P 500 index\nalong with the proportion of stocks traded in London weighted \nby the FTS Index.  Gradually if you consider all the major \nmarkets today such as Tokyo, Paris, London, New York,\nCanada TSE, etc.,\nyou'll be able to compute a suitable weighted average \nRORmrkt. \n\nThe major problem you need to ovwercome in any emerging market like China is thin market trading--translation too few stocks are quoted and trading activity in them takwes too long to \nprovide investors /money managers with enough information\nderived from each successive buy-sell combination). \n\n\n  Assuming you did find an adequately traded stock with enough \nhistory in the Chinese stock market, and you did compute a \nworld market index surrogate for the market index along \nwith selecting a risk free asset such as by using the U.S. \nT Bill Yield, then you could use the equation to correctly \nprice the Chinese stock in terms of its rate of return.\n\nAssume further that you average the returns on the world market\nindexes and it turns out to be 12%.\n\nNext regress the Chinese stock past returns (having converted from Yen capital gains and dividends) againtst the historical \nworld market stock index levels for the same number of observations as you have on the Chinese stock (note: the data \nmust be aligned so that they are matched for the same time periods as those of the Chinese stock'sprice observations. \nIn other words the matched pairs must be contemperaneous with one another. You should use say weekly, monthly close \ndata and with the problem I described earlier I would use the \nlater time interval for obserfvations.  \n\nThe coefficient of this OLS simple regression is the Beta\non the stock.  Assume it is 1.5 positive.\n\n    If we assume a yield on the U.S. T Bill of 5%, the math \nthen is  Stock ROR% = 5% + 1.5(10%-5%) = 5%+7.5%= 12%\n\nThere's the heart of your paper...now gety busy and write it.\n\nTry doing a dogpile or other search for academic journal, textbooks on international finance, and other sources.",8877

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines.

What say you? ; Personally I think if you have to cite the fact that you appointed two Black Citizens to such high positions, you did it because you wanted to use that cite.  Don't get me wrong, I think Powell and Rice are highly qualified for the positions, but I'm guessing there are others of many other races that are equals to them.  So either they are better suited to the position (Very Likely) or Bush needed some help and decided to make himself look good while also bringing on highly qualified people (More likely).  I hate to say that, but with everything else the administation has done and the way they spin everything (They aren't the only side doing it might I add) to fit a need makes me question it.\n\nI do think for the most part things have stayed the same, excpet for Muslims which are now viewed as some sort of enemy (A great example of this is Army commercials that feature soldiers watching ""Terrorists"", all of which are wearing turbans and in deserts.\n\nOh and I think Powell quit because he couldn't sacrifice his integrity for Bush.  ""Condie"" has now been made somewhat of a spokesperson, I see her more and more now.  It's also a good way to place blame, even if she didn't write the words, she said them and to most people, whoever said the words is guilty of creating them.  We do the same thing to any other political official good or bad. For example, people giving presidents credit for speeches that they didn't write.  For speaking the way they do takes practice which is also coached, it's more and more common now.

2,"how do u know when ur bipolar and what can a 14 year old girl do to get help? ; i need to know this answer bad... ; Well, first you need to look at your family history.  Has anyone in your family ever been bipolar or had bipolar tendencies?  If so, then here's the second question:  Are you ADD or ADHD?\n\nHere's my personal story:\n\nI started my period at 11.  By 13 I hit ""teenager"" years and by 14 I was into puberty.  You know, boobs, hair, voice, the works.  Except something happened.  I turned into Frankenstein's Mood monster.  I was always either really excited and upbeat, or so depressed that I would stay in my room for days and bite off anyone's head who tried to talk to me.\n\nMy family became so distraut that they finally talked about sending me to a boarding school.  the house was always tense, but I thought it was everyone else.  I was kicked out several times, moved back home, and just barely made it through my teen years without going crazy.  When I was 21, I married, and my husband saw the same thing in me - we were always fighting, and I knew it was always my fault.  I felt crazy because my moodswings were so bad.\n\nAfter lots of research and lots of crazy doctors trying to prescribe me medicines, I learned the most facinating thing:  Kids who are ADD or ADHD and go through puberty actually experience bipolar tendencies.  It's a natural, hormone-imbalance.  And since I was ADHD my whole life, it was normal.  Man I wish someone had know that back then!!!!!!\n\nHere's what you need to do:  Find out if you're ADD or ADHD.  Change your diet from sugars and white flours to lots of grains, good dark green vegetables, and unprocessed sugars and eat healthy.  Exercise and work out regularly.  Talk to your doctor about natural ways to balance out your hormones through this period.  It's possible.\n\nIt's okay, you're going to be alright.  You'll make it through this, even though now it doesn't seem like it. \n\nIf it is bipolar, you would have known at an early age, before this time.  Since you're 14 and starting to experience these symptoms, I would say most likely it's that your hormones are turning you into a woman.  Hang in there, girl!",9004

2,"Do fat people get stomach aches? ; I know when I eat too much I get a stomach ache ; Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found new clues to how the brain and the stomach interact with emotions to cause overeating and obesity. By looking at how the human brain responds to ""fullness"" messages sent to the brain by an implanted device that stimulates the stomach, the scientists have identified brain circuits that motivate the desire to overeat in the obese -- the same circuits that cause addicted individuals to crave drugs. The scientists have also verified that these circuits play a critical role in eating behaviors linked to soothing negative emotions. The study appears in the October 17, 2006 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published online in PNAS Early Edition the week of October 2.\n\nThis study opens new territory in understanding how the body and brain connect to each other, and how this connection is tied to obesity,"" said lead author Gene-Jack Wang of Brookhaven Lab's Center for Translational Neuroimaging.

This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need at least 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Be very conscious of your nutrition.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym.   I'd go the gym route at least to start, if you have never done weight training before.  Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.\n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss. \n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4. even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\n8.  Did your oncology team ever refer you to a dietician?   That may help you.   Also talk to them about your weight concerns and get their opinions.  \n\nI hope these thoughts help. You can do this. Good luck with it.",9143

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146
2,"New job and a persistant bacterial infection dilema... read for more details? ; I got sick on October 16th and ended up in the ER unable to breathe and was throwing up.  The doctor examined me and said I had a bacterial infection of my lungs, sinuses, larynx, and ears.  He prescribed z-pak and I was sent home for a week of bed rest.  The next week I returned to my full time student status at the local university with a still really run down feeling.  Being optimistic, I reinterviewed for my old job as a seasonal full time employee (Circuit City).  That weekend, I started once again feeling horrible and returned to urgent care on Monday.  The doctor this time prescribed Levaquin.  After I took it for 4 days, I pretty much lost the ability to focus my eyes and to keep down anything but yogurt.  I finished my prescription neverless since my doctor said it wasn't an allergic reaction.  I finished my pills this past Friday and was offered a job on Saturday.  Again, I am prematurely optimistic because my symptoms are once again returning.  I'm suppose to start work ; Run, don't walk somewhere that sells good probiotics.(any health food store will have them in their fridge, if you can't find them ask)\n  You have had two major rounds of antibiotics. ABX  nuke all the bacteria in your system, including the good ones.  The ""bad"" ones tend to reproduce more quickly than the ones that are beneficial to us. To rebuild those quicker than the ones that cause problems, you help them out by orally taking some. \nAcidolpholus and bifidus are two of them. There is lactobaccilus as well as a handful of others. If there are 3 or 4  kinds, that's not a bad thing.\n I take them on a semi regular basis, as well as any time I have taken ABX in the last 10 years. If I don't, I get sinus and yeast infections for weeks afterward.\nThe way to figure out if your probiotics are still alive is to break a capsule into a little cup of milk and leave it in the fridge over night. If it's thick like yogurt in the morning, they're good. If not, if it's thin like milk, then they aren't working any more.  A bottle at the health food store should run between $10-15. . \nYou'll need to go to a health food store or order online to get good probiotics. Get the kind that have to be refrigerated, not tablets that don't have to be kept cold.  The ones that have to be kept cold are better quality.\nIn addition to taking probiotics, eat less simple carbs. There is a ""candida diet"" out there that is supposed to help your body not support candida overgrowth, which is what multiple or recurring  infections sounds like to me, esp when more than one round of ABX is involved. I'm not a doc, I've just been there too many times before I found out about probiotics.\nThat diet I mentioned, cuts out simple carbs, and limits complex carbs at first. Then you find your own balance that your body can tolerate. \nhere are a couple of links to different varieties of that diet...\nhttp://altmedicine.about.com/od/popularhealthdiets/a/candidadiet.htm\nhttp://candidapage.com/candiet.txt\n  \nhth",9147

Tell yourself you are improving at them.

Answer TRUE/FALSE to the following statements:\n\n(a) Matings of pure breeding black mice with brown mice would yield both black and brown offspring in the ratio 3:1\n\n(b) Matings of pure breeding black mice would yield only black offspring\n\n(c) Matings of brown mice could yield black and brown offspring\n\n(d) Matings of heterozygous black mice with brown mice would yield both black and brown offspring in the ratio of 1:1\n\nand also if possible could you explain how you got your answers! thank you so much, i've racked my brain over and over again with this question and i just can't seem to get it. So explanations are much appreciated as they will help me to understand it a little better. Thank you so much!! ; Let B mean the genotype for dominant black fur and b mean the genotype for brown fur. \n\nRecall that when a gene is dominant, it is always expressed when  it is present. When a gene is recessive then it is ONLY expressed  when there is no alternative.\n\na) Pure black mice would have B1B2 and brown mice must be b1b2 because it is a recessive gene. (I've put in the numbers to act as subscripts so it makes more sense.) Crossing these, you would get offspring that inherit one gene from each parent.\nB1b1 ==> black\nB1b2 ==> black\nB2b1 ==> black\nB2b2 ==> black\n\nSo false because all the offspring from pure black and brown rats would be black. \n\nb) True. Pure black mice have BB. As both parents have BB then there's not a chance for bb to occur!\n\nc) False. Brown mice are always bb (recessive) so bb x bb can never result in Bb or BB. So offspring of 2 brown mice are always brown.\n\nd) Heterozygous black mice are Bb. So crossed with brown mouse bb (b1b2):\nBb1 ==> black\nbb1 ==> brown\nBb2 ==> black\nbb2 ==> brown\nSo you get equal numbers of black and brown offspring. True.",9171

Heres some more info.  Watch out though.  Do not use this verbatim.  Much of it was from an on-line web site, and teachers can search for plagiarized work.  Anyways, here you go...\n\n\n Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter\n    Uploaded on Jun 3, 2005  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nEffects of Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter \n\nEach society in the world is unique, and each has its own values and beliefs. Throughout time, societies have shaped the way that man lives. This includes not only his actions, but it also includes his thoughts and feelings. In many instances, such as in Puritan societies, religion plays the most important role. The Crucible by Arthur Miller and The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne are stories which vividly demonstrate the effect society has on people. The Puritan society that is created in each of these stories acts as the driving force to their plots. \nIn The Crucible, the entire plot is molded by the morals of the Puritan society. The superstition that many Puritans believed in is represented through Reverend Parris. He insists to Abigail that “if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Miller 10). Parris was not only concerned about the witches, but was terrified that his reputation will be ruined as well. This example also leads to another aspect of Puritan society that affected the plot. The Puritan people were very closely knit, meaning that everyone knew everyone else, and consequently, rumors spread quickly. This was why Reverend Parris needed to know “Who? Who? Their names, their names!” (Miller 44), so he could find someone to blame for the madness. The fear of witchcraft was so strong that even the decent Reverend John Hale, who was the most open minded of the characters, worried about its effect. He even had books in which there “…is all the invisible world, caught, defined, and calculated…the Devil stands stripped of all his brute disguises…we shall find him out if he has come among us…” (Miller 37). Another attitude of Puritan society that shapes this play is the fear of God. This fear is seen everywhere and it goes hand in hand with the idea of superstition. \nReverend Hale tells Tituba, “You are God’s instrument…face God- face God, Tituba, and God will protect you” (Miller 44), exhibiting the great trust that the people hold in God and how their actions are all in the name of him. This story would not exist without the God-fearing mindset of the Puritan people. John Proctor is no exception to this theme. He has a moral dilemma in which he states, “…I wilted, and, like a Christian, I confessed. Confessed!…Let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not!” (Miller 52). Even though he did not seem like the most religious man in the story, he remains loyal to his strong morals because of the society around him. The Puritan society in The Crucible was what let the story make sense. \nThe Scarlet Letter is another story that relies on the values of the Puritans and their society. The idea of harsh punishment for sins was the broadest of these values. Hester Prynne was punished with public humiliation and “with only that one ornament, -the scarlet letter,- which it was her doom to we",9830

1,"g(x)= x(squared) sin (1/x). how do i use the definition of the derivative to show that g is differentiable? ; for the function f(x)= x sin (1/x).  how do show that it is contiuous at x=0.  show that f(0+h)-f(0)/h = sin (1/h).  Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

2,"Is there any way of recognizing whether if someone you know has multiple persona? ; No, I don't think a friend of mine has multiple persona, I just have an interest in psychology. ; Multiple personality disorder is now called Dissociative identity disorder.  There is much controversy on this disorder, with many people beleiving it doesn't exist at all.  If you want more information you can check out the DSM.  \n\nFor a quick overveiw of symptoms:\n\nPatients exhibit a remarkable array of symptoms that can resemble other neurologic and psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety disorders, personality disorders, schizophrenic and mood psychoses, and seizure disorders. Symptoms of this particular disorder can sometimes include:\n\ndepression \nanxiety (sweating, rapid pulse, palpitations) \nphobias \npanic attacks \nphysical symptoms (severe headaches or other bodily pain) \nfluctuating levels of function, from highly effective to disabled \ntime distortions, time lapse, and amnesia \nsexual dysfunction \neating disorders \nsleeping disorders (insomnia, sleepwalking, night terrors) \nposttraumatic stress \nsuicidal preoccupations and attempts \nepisodes of self-mutilation \npsychoactive substance abuse[4] \nSigns of DID include:\n\ndiscussion of self in 3rd person \nnever feeling alone \ntalk of looking through others' eyes \ntalk of being half in and half out of their body \nsays ""we"" when talking about themselves \nabused as a child-87% (physically, mentally or verbally) \nOther symptoms include: Depersonalization, which refers to feeling unreal, removed from one's self, and detached from one's physical and mental processes. The patient feels like an observer of his life and may actually see himself as if he were watching a movie. Derealization refers to experiencing familiar persons and surroundings as if they were unfamiliar and strange or unreal.\n\nAgain, doctors must be careful not to assume that a client has MPD or DID simply because they present with some or all of these symptoms. Another factor in the diagnosis is that all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares idea, which is to say that although many of these symptoms may be present in an individual, he or she may not necessarily have DID. For example, someone may have severe PTSD (one symptom) and self mutilate with suicidal ideas, which is 3 of the above symptoms, but will not have DID. In order for DID to be diagnosed, there must be two or more distinctly present personalities.\n\nPersons with dissociative identity disorder are often told of things they have done but do not remember and of notable changes in their behavior. They may discover objects, productions, or handwriting that they cannot account for or recognize; they may refer to themselves in the first person plural (we) or in the third person (he, she, they); and they may have amnesia for events that occurred between their mid-childhood and early adolescence. Amnesia for earlier events is normal and widespread.",9876

I can only start 2 RB's, and i have Ronnie Brown, Joseph Addai, and Cadillac Williams. \nI drafted Caddy with my #1 Pick, but he's played very poorly. Addai has found the end zone the last few weeks, and has outscored Caddy. \n\nWho should i start between Caddy and Addai? (I know i'm starting Brown) ; So easy. I'd go with a trade. Addai is stuck in a Manning offense, and Cadillac stinks this year (sophomore slump). Trade Either of them for someone sorta like LT or LJ. May I suggest Mike Alstott?\n#1denverfan",9917

4,"amazon.com and amazon marketplace is the same thing? ; if not, whats the difference? ; Amazon Marketplace is is where sellers other than Amazon can sell their used or new items. When you are looking at an item, look to see who it is available from. It can say one or both of the following: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and/or available from these sellers. In my experience as an employee, I have seen items ship all over the world. If it says ships from and sold by Amazon then it should ship anywhere in the world. If you select an item from a different seller, there is a chance that they will not ship overseas. The great thing about Amazon is that they will post a link to sellers of an item even if they sell it cheaper than Amazon does. That way, you have a choice as to where to go to purchase an item.\n\nOf course, if you are still unsure about shipping to your country, you can always email customer service. The website also lists links to several of their international sites.\n\nThe first link I've listed should take you to a a portion of Amazon's site that lists deadlines for international orders. The second will take you to an Amazon.com help page that will have helpful information on it. Both will have a button on it that you can click on to contact customer service.\n\nHope this helps!",9925

2,"detox diet?? ; Has anyone heard of a detox diet? If so what are some of your views on it? ; Right now there are several diets being called the detox diet, so I am not sure if you mean the one with maple syrup or not.\nIf it is the one with maple syrup---forget it. It's not healthy.\n\nYou are much better off visiting your local health food store (or GNC or Costco) . On their shelves you will see several variations of detoxing diets. There is one where you take 2 capsules a night for 30 nights. It's a slow detox but it does work. There is also one that works over 14 days.\n\nIf you are new at detoxing you will find yourself with very unpleasant side effects. Like: flu symptoms, coughing, fever, tiredness, being cranky, dizzy and several more. \n\nThat is why the slow detox is best to start out with. It slowly detoxes the system so you don't notice the side effects.\n\nOnce you detox slowly, then you can detox more agressively.\n\nThe first time I detoxed, I started with the 30 days, then went to the 14 days, now when I do a 2 day fast/detox there are no unpleasant side effects.",9949
3,"Is it correct to say, ""I don't hardly...""? ; I'm trying to solve a petty dispute about double negatives. My friend always uses this sentence structure. He says something like, ""I don't hardly sleep."" I say this is incorrect because I was taught that even though the word 'hardly' isn't like any other negative, it is still a negative nonetheless. In saying the quote above wouldn't he be saying the exact opposite than he means, which is something like ""I sleep a lot."" He means to say, ""I hardly ever sleep,"" or ""I don't sleep very much."" I'm just a little confused. I need someone who knows their grammar. ; It's better to say ""I hardly"" or ""I rarely."" ""Don't Hardly"" is a double-negative.",9951
