1,"Marble Rollocoster? ; I am learning about Nutin's law an object going in a straight line will remain to until it is acted on. I am doing an obsticle corse for it in school, so does anyone know anything that will slow a marble down? ; A marble is a rolling mass.  The theory is that the marble rolls along and the area of the marble in contact with the surface it is rolling on is not slipping.\n\nAs the marble rolls along, the forces that act on it are \n\n1.  Gravity\n\n2.  Air resistance\n\nI recommend that you focus on gravity to create forces of predictable magnitude and direction.  You can use ramps and then apply Newton's laws and a little trig to calculate the force magnitudes and predict the motion of the marble. As long as you have a decent velocity without being too fast, air resistance will be negligible.\n\nI designed a simple track for you that you could make out of light plywood and some glue.\n\nThe track I propose will be a valley that is 2 meters long (a little over 6 feet) and 1/2 meter wide( 20 inches wide will give you some margin).  The valley sides are set at an angle of 30 degrees.  At one end of the valley at the top of the valley side set up a ramp that will inject a marble such that the direction of the velocity of the marble is straight with respect to the edge of the valley.  The height of the ramp will control the velocity of the.\n\nNow, consider a coordinate system that has x starting from the same end as the ramp and running parallel to the sides of the valley.  y is perpindicular to the sides of the valley.\n\nI created a variable, h, that is the vertical height of the starting end of the ramp with respect to the entry point of the marble.\nUsing conservation of energy, the velocity of the marble will be related through the equation:\n1/2*m*v^2=m*g*h\nv=sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nThe time it will take the marble to roll the length of the valley I set as t\nlength of the valley is 2m\nso 2m=v*t\nt=2/sqrt(2*g*h)\n\nWhen the marble enters the top edge of the valley it will have a velocity in the x direction of v as derived above.  This is your constant velocity since the only forces that will act on the marble in the x direction is air resistance, which we will assume to be negligible.\nSince the marble enters the valley near the top edge, it will be acted on by gravity to pull it down the edge.  If you have the marble enter the ramp at exactly .25m from the center, it reach the center of the ramp in time t'\nwhere \n.25=1/2*g*cos(30)*t'^2\nor t'=sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\n\nI thought it would be fun to consider an experiment where you control how many times the marble rolls across the center of the valley before exiting at the other end.\nThis I set as N\nNote that t/t'=N\nN=(2/sqrt(2*g*h))/sqrt(.5/(g*cos(30))\nN=2*sqrt(g*cos(30))/sqrt(2*g*h*.5)\nN=2*sqrt(cos(30)/h)\n\nThen I thought that it would be fun to set up an equation where we decide how many Ns we want according to how high we set the end of the ramp.  Sound like fun?\n\nN^2=4*cos(30)/h\nh=4*cos(30)/N^2\n(h is in units of meters)\nN   h(m)   h(inches)\n3    .385    15.15\n4    .0771   3.04\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nj",9

5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13

0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

2,"i can't sleep at night i don't drink caffine though.? ; I'm 12 and i want my sleep! i want to grow :) but i CAN'T SLEEP. i feel uncomfortable and my heart rate goes fast and i breathe hard it bothers me so much. whats wrong with me? does fast metabolism cause this? ; Your metabolism determines how much energy you expend while at rest; it does not determine how well you sleep.\n\nI'll give you some pointers on getting a better night's sleep. If these ""sleep hygiene"" tips don't work, you may wish to consult a doctor.\n\n1. Avoid caffeine. It sounds like you're already doing this, so good for you! (I'm posting this advice anyway in case others are having similar problems.) Also avoid smoking (as nicotine is a stimulant) and drinking alcohol (which interferes with natural sleep) before bedtime.\n\n2. Try to go to bed and get up the same time each day, even if you don't have to (e.g., on weekends). This will help your body establish a stable sleep schedule.\n\n3. Turn the lights down about an hour before your bedtime. Light sends signals to your brain that it should be awake, and this is not the message you want to send if you want some sleep!\n\n4. Exercise regularly! But avoid exercising a few hours before your bedtime.\n\n5. Take a warm bath or shower before bed. This will help relax you.\n\n6. Drink milk shortly before bedtime, or eat some turkey. Both of these foods contain substances that help promote sleep. Some people have reported success with taking melatonin.\n\n7. Do not use your bed to watch TV, play video games, read, or do your homework. You want your brain to associate being in bed with going to sleep, not other activities.\n\n8. If you find you cannot sleep, don't stay in bed and get anxious about how much sleep you're missing. Instead, get up, and find some relaxing activity you can do (e.g., reading) under dim light until you begin to feel drowsy again.\n\n9. Be careful about taking sleep-inducing medications, as these can be habit-forming and also interfere with the REM (dream) phase of sleep, which is the most refreshing part of sleep.\n\nGood luck!",27
7,"Why does everyone who makes a ""how much do you know about Naruto"" quiz on quizilla, think they know all about ; it?   This is a question my son wants answered:D ; This happens because there are Naruto fans that they know almost everything there is to the animation series, but in reality, the actual Japanese companies: Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo, Aniplex, and TV Tokyo Music, who have created the series really know everything about the series.\n\nThere are lots of Naruto fans out there and some even live on the shows when they are released. When an individual makes a quiz, they just want to compare their knowledge with other people who are also fans to Naruto. \n\nThere can even be times when the person making the quiz is wrong on some facts. However, they just guess and make questions out of them. It is only their opinion of who is right or wrong. Unless a person has analyzed every aspect and every episode of the Naruto series, a person will not be able to know everything about it. \n\nThose who make the quizzes probably do know a lot about the anime series, but I doubt they know everything. The basic truths of the human mind can only go so far.\n\nQuizilla is a place that people make quizzes to test others' abilities or are bored and have enjoyment while creating their own quiz. I don't recommend the site if you want to learn more things that others have already learned. \n\nAll and all, confidence is the key idea that we should be looking at in the person making the quiz.

1,"when zinc rod is immeersed in blue colour copper sulphate. blue colour fades away. give reasons.? ; chemistry ; all the information you need is in the handy periodic table.   First, think about the charges of the molecules....\n\n In the molecule CuSO4, copper has two electrons to give.  The SO4 molecule wants TWO more electrons to acheive noble gas configuration (a stable electron state).   This appears to be a match in heaven.  \n\nWell all is fine until Zinc comes along.  If you look at the periodic table, Zinc is just to the right of copper.  It too has 2 electrons to donate......but, it is more electronegative than copper. (remember, electronegativity  is the lowest in the bottom left corner of the table(Fr) and increases on  a diagonal path  with F being the most electronegarive.)  \n\nSince Zinc is more reactive than Copper,  a replacement reaction occurs.  Zinc bumps Copper off of the SO4 molucule.  Zinc can be whitiish to yellowish in solution.  As all the Zinc is coming off the rod, it bumps the copper off the SO4 and also disperses the colour of the copper.  If you had one drop of blue dye (the copper), but added a cup of milk.

If you are really that scared just talk to the receptionist and tell her how you feel about trips to the dentist. You can also relay this info to the dentist him/herself when you get there. Dentists for the most part are very freindly people and when doing a procedure such as filling a cavity (or maybe pulling the tooth) they are very careful that you are as comfortable as possible. You probably won't feel anything but you'll hear some pretty weird sounds such as drilling. All you need to do for this is bring your IPOD or other music playing device and crank that bitch up! The dentist isn't going to mind as long as the wires from the headphones don't get in the way.\nAlso most dentist offices let you pay so much per month until you're all paid off.

0,"Is there any way I can quit acting like Judas all of the time?(please read on)? ; Every time I get ""saved"" something-someone hurts me, i always blame it on God. I feel like Judas, now I see no point in turning to God if I am going to betray him once again. Any ideas for me? ; If something hurts you it is just god testing your faith. He puts us through trials and tribulations to test our faith in him. No matter what happens we should always stick with him through thick and thin. If you continue turning on God nothing will ever seem right.\n\nIt is comforting to know that with God, all trials and tribulations have a divine purpose. We are never alone. He told His disciples that they would be scattered, leaving Him alone, and yet ""I am not alone, because the Father is with me. ""These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. ""In the world you have tribulation, but take courage, I have overcome the world."" (John 16:32, 33)\n\n \n\n""...I will never leave you, nor forsake you; therefore I can boldly say, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man can do to me"" (Hebrews 13:5b,6). Trials develop godly character. ""...we exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character, and proven character, hope; and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us...\n\n \n\nJesus Christ set the perfect example. ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" (Romans 5:3-5) These verses point out aspects of His divine purpose for both Jesus Christ's trials and tribulations, and ours. Persevering proves our faith. ""I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me"" (Philippians 4:13).\n\n \n\n""In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which perishes, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."" The true believer should accept trials and tribulations because ""You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for Gods own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light"" (1 Peter 1:6, 7, 2:9). ""If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.....""if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God"" (1 Peter 4:14, 16).\n\n \n\nAt the same time, we must be careful never to make excuses for our ""trials and tribulations"" if they are a result of our own wrong doing. ""By no means let any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler"" (1 Peter 4:15).\n\n \n\nTrials and tribulations come with both a purpose and a reward. ""Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."" ""Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love Him"" (James 1:2-4,12).\n\n \n\nWe have the victory. ""But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord, Jesus Christ."" I hope that these verses will encourage you to see that although we are in a spiritual battle, Satan has no authority over the believer in Christ, unless he/she chooses to yield to him. God has given us His Word to guide us, His Holy Spirit to enable us, and the privilege of coming to Him anywhere, at any time, to pray about anything! Go for it!",58

Why is the weather like this?

Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.

1,"If magnetic field of earth is changing continuosly would that effect bird migration patterns?? ; if polarity of earth is changed upside down, would that effect the birds?? ; That is a good question.

Apparently on average it flips every 300,000 years, and  the last flip was 780,000 years ago, so we are a bit overdue at the moment.

I felt that I was doing double what my manager, basically doing his management job for him, and was getting paid very little.

Always looking over your shoulder for another dollar and you'll never be satisfied that you're being paid what you're worth.""  I found another job ASAP after that, where I'm happy to report that I make three and a half times what I was making when I left there.  They were taking advantage of me, and trying to make me believe they weren't.  That's abusive behavior.  \n\nIf you're in the market for a raise, good luck!!

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

0,"Your religion and population? ; I always wandered what drives people that live poor, in lack of health, food, infrastructure,..., to have many children. I know sometimes it is religion, but I would like to dig deeper here. I know it is also poverty, lack of knowledge, lack of education on contraception, so I am focusing on religion and its role. An example (due to the sensitivity of the issue, I will not state the country): religious people do not work here, do not pay taxes, and live really in modesty, many times in hunger. But their religion tells them to have many children, therefore many of religious families have more than 8 children - who live poor, in lack of food, lack of proper education,... I do not understand this. I myself love children, would love to have 4, but do not have job, I am 28, therefore I do not want to have my first child yet. Even if my religion is telling me 'children are a gift from God', I am sorry, but to me it is not responsible to have them yet or to have many. ????? ; I agree with you, I often wonder, in Africa for example where christianity is rising, why the pope still claims contraception is wrong when encouraging it would help stabilize the countries HIV/Aids epidemic and could also help the countries economy in the long run - having less children means the children they have are better fed, they can afford some sort of education as they have a couple of children to send to school. These children once educated could get better jobs and the cycle carries on. \nIf I was living in poverty I wouldn't have so many children as it is selfish - having them just because you want so many and your religion tells you to do so. They can not provide for them and it is cruel to the children who suffer starvation and a slow painful death in the name of religion.",131

0,"Pagan please help? ; I want to become a wicca what should I do?  What do I need to know. ; Don't decide you want to become Wicca until you know something about it - that is what you need to know - Wicca is a very specific 'branch' of Paganism, it is a priesthood within it's own rights, as well as a lot of study it can be difficult to find a coven in order to become Wicca.\n\nGeneral tips would fall into – study study study – with a lot of misinformation about Wicca it is easy for people to fall into thinking they are Wicca when in fact they are not, I have honestly met people who have called themselves Wicca for 10 years without actually realising they are not Wicca as until that point they had been unable or unwilling to step out of their comfort zone to study further into Wicca past their bad sources they had been used to for so long. Don't fall into that trap, Wicca is a constant learning path and it is no good closing yourself off to new information that challenges your current ideas on what Wicca is – although misinformation is hardly a positive there is at least one thing to be said of misinformation about Wicca, it helps determine those serious about becoming Wicca from those unwilling.\n\nWith that said there are things to avoid – Wicca is an initiate-only oath-bound priesthood working within a pagan mystery tradition, generally if a book or web site says otherwise they are not a reliable source, there are other signs to avoid such as people who use the spelling 'magick' are often uneducated themselves, people who use mechanical magic (i.e. copying spells from books or each other) – that is not to say these sources cannot teach you something. You will find most people will pooh-pooh people such as Horne, Ravenwolf, Buckland, etc. however valid their complaints are there are often some parts of their writing that are valid, and if nothing else you can use these as a test to your own knowledge as the more you study the more you can tell the reliable information from the nonsense.\n\nGet yourself into a good forum, you will find many forums are filled with people who look to Wicca as an escape from Christianity or as a fashionable title, however there are some groups around that do have Wicca that have a strong community that can help you study and guide you in the right direction – Amber & Jet being a prime example of this. Another idea would be to find yourself local Pagan contacts or go along to local pagan meetings to form study groups, find a coven, find a teacher, or simply have a community to support you or just chit-chat with (a note here, study should come before training, or else you won't know who is really knowledgeable on the subject and who is not when it comes to finding a teacher or coven).\n\nWith that I suppose all I can do is give you some reliable links and books to look through – with books if you cannot afford them try swapping with others online or in your area, and remember you don't have to just stick to books on Wicca but can also get books on related subjects such as paganism, herb lore, mythology, divination, etc.\n\nIf you do want to become Wcica in the end if you cannot find a coven locally you will have to find one, many Seekers will actually move locations to find a coven to join so to become Wicca, others simply convert to Neo-wicca if they cannot find a coven.\n\nGood luck :o)\n\n\nSome links to help you learn a little more about Wicca;\n\nhttp://amberandjet.spiralpaths.org - Amber & Jet\nhttp://www.cyprian.org/Articles/gardchron.htm - Gardnerian Chronology and Bibliography\nhttp://www.wargoddess.net/index.php - Enyo`s Workshop\nhttp://wicca.timerift.net/ - Wicca: For the Rest of Us\nhttp://www.homecircle.info - Homecircle\nhttp://www.starkindler.org/ - StarFire Rising\nhttp://www.asiya.org/ - Asiya`s Shadows\nhttp://www.whywiccanssuck.com - Why Wiccans Suck\nhttp://www.newwiccanchurch.net - New Wiccan Church International\nhttp://members.tripod.com/~Moonpfyr/gardnerian.html - Gardnerian Tradition\nhttp://www.geocities.com/Athen",150

The powers not EXPLICITLY granted the federal goernment are reserved for the states and the people respectively. So, for example, since abortion or what are oddly called ""reproductive rights"" are not mentioned in the US Constitution (and mentioning the 14th amendment when ruling on Roe v.Wade was a stretch), I would say that the state has the right to make laws forbidding or allowing abortion. The federal government simply has no role, just like they do not have a role in states passing laws about the death penalty.\n(2) I would reject the ""living constitution"" bs many judges talk about. The living constitution theory of jurisprudence says it makes the constitution ""flexible"", in reality, it makes it very rigid by allowing judges to nullify the other two branches of the government. The constitution was designed to make the legislative branch, the one ""closest to the people"" the one which makes the laws. Then comes the president who ENFORCES those laws, and then comes the judiciary whose job is to INTREPRET those laws and to intrepret whether they are being enforced correctly.

1,"Is this possible to know about future by Einstein's Time Traveler / The twin paradox theory? ; I am very curious about this topic, or tell me if any other possibilities to know about future atleast theoretically. ; In fact we indeed are traveling in time. But, only in one direction, i.e., towards the future; and that too, with a certain fixed 'speed' (call it, spending one second per second). Do you understand what I am saying? I am saying that we can not move backward towards our past, and , we have no control over the passage of time.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, however suggests a theoretical method to control the passage of time: Time dilation, which requires moving with speeds around the speed of light. The theory holds that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. However, this effect allows ""time travel"" only toward the future: never backward. \n\nMany in the scientific community believe that time travel is highly unlikely. This belief is largely due to Occam's Razor. Any theory which would allow time travel would require that issues of causality be resolved. What happens if you try to go back in time and kill your grandfather. Also, in the absence of any experimental evidence that time travel exists, it is theoretically simpler to assume that it does not happen. Indeed, Stephen Hawking once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel - a variant of the Fermi paradox, with time travelers instead of alien visitors. However, assuming that time travel cannot happen is also interesting to physicists because it opens up the question of why and what physical laws exist to prevent time travel from occurring. \n\nFrom the above note, one can note two points:\n1. Time-travel is highly unlikely, and,\n2. Possibly, it is uni-directional (towards the future, not back to past).\n\nSo, it seems that knowing the future by visiting it is either not possible, or, once you are in your future, you can't come back to present to tell your friends that you know the future!!!\n\nPartly, knowing the future theoretically, is perhaps possible if you understand and meticulously use the principle of causality.",254

First if the police have reason to believe (probable cause) that a person was in a motor vehicle accident due to being drunk or high (Driving while under the influenece) it is perfectly legal to draw blood also as mention by numerous other people, in most states simply signing your license is consenting to a 'chemical test' and failing to consent to one is a crime in and of itself.

Now, if more Americans would watch soccer and learn more about the sport, I'm sure they wouldn't be so hard on the US team. Because they do have amazing players.

Protectionist policies are those that advantage domestic goods over foreign goods (exports v imports) through either tarriffs (surcharges added to the price of a good being imported) or through subsidies (price supports or distributive policies within a country) to grow or make some item.\nObviously, similiar to the micro level of a larger grocery store being able to get better prices when negotiating with its suppliers compared to a smaller chain or a 'mom & pop' type store, larger countries (typically first world) are better positioned to DICTATE supply agreements (not much can be done about demand---other than to decrease it through tarriffs (VAT) which would be passed on to the consumer).  \nThird and second world countries are often in a very tenuous position:  their government wants to expand their economy through increasing exports, however, often this is done through either internally, creating subsidies (which many cannot afford to do) or agreeing to 'lopsided' trade agreements, which wind up exploiting or at a minimum, disadvantaging their citizens and other workers in their respective countries or nations.

In how many ways can a team win the play-off? \n\nFor the baseball World Series, a team must win four out of seven games. In how many ways can a team win the World Series? ; In the simplest sense, the ""best of five"" series can be won in only three ways:  3 games straight, 3 games out of 4, or 3 games out of 5.  \n\nWithin those three ways, though, the order of wins and losses can vary considerably.  For example, WWW (win, win, win) is the only way for the 3 games straight, but the 3 games out of 4 can be LWWW (lose, win, win, win) or WLWW or WWLW.  The 3 games out of 5 can be WWLLW, WLWLW, LLWWW, WLLWW, LWLWW, or LWWLW.\n\nYou get the idea, I'm sure.",359

Since then, however, he's told me to take a load of vitamins every day, and at the last visit gave me a 'relaxation and meditation' CD that, among other things, asks me to visualize waterfalls and clouds (?!?). The more things progress, the more we seem to veer away from 'medicine' and towards alternative healthcare mumbo jumbo. I'm feeling a bit deceived, but this dentist is insisting this will help. All the while, I keep writing very, very large cheques. Am I being unreasonable? Are there real treatments I'm missing out on? What should I ask or, or insist on, at my next visit? Many thanks!! ; Sounds liek your doctor is a quack. A relaxation CD? Well TMD is a complex disease that people don't really understand all that well but there are steps to treatment. First step is that if you grind or clench at night or in the daytime is to correct that problem. Stressing a bad joint is only going to make the problem worse. So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain. Stop ibuprofen though if it tears up your stomach. There are treatments .... and there are steps.  This guy giving you a CD and charging you money for that crap is not medicine",364

4,"What is 16X, 24X, 32X,in terms of CD/DVD burning? ; How exactly it works, and what is the most preferred speed top write? Experts pls explain........... ; The rate at which CD-ROM drives can transfer data from the disc is gauged by a speed factor relative to music CDs: 1x or 1-speed which gives a data transfer rate of 150 kilobytes per second in the most common data format. By increasing the speed at which the disc is spun, data can be transferred at greater rates. For example, a CD-ROM drive that can read at 8x speed spins the disc at up to 4000 rpm (compared to the 500 rpm maximum for 1x speed), giving a transfer rate of 1.2 megabytes per second. Above 12x speed, vibration and heat can become a problem. CD-ROM drives above this speed tackle the problem in several ways. Constant angular velocity (CAV) drives spin the disc at a constant rate, leading to faster data transfer when reading from the outer parts of the disc, but slower towards the centre. 20x was thought to be the maximum speed due to mechanical constraints until Samsung Electronics introduced the SCR-3230, a 32x CD-ROM drive which uses a ball bearing system to balance the spinning disc in the drive to reduce vibration and noise. As of 2004, the fastest transfer rate commonly available is about 52x or 7.62 megabytes per second, though this is only when reading information from the outer parts of a disc. Future speed increases based simply upon spinning the disc faster are particularly limited by the strength of polycarbonate plastic used in CD manufacturing, though improvements can still be obtained by the use of multiple laser pickups as demonstrated by the Kenwood TrueX 72x which uses seven laser beams and a rotation speed of approximately 10x.\n\nCD-Recordable drives are often sold with three different speed ratings, one speed for write-once operations, one for re-write operations, and one for read-only operations. The speeds are typically listed in that order; ie a 12x/10x/32x CD drive can, CPU and media permitting, write to CD-R disks at 12x speed (1.76 megabytes/s), write to CD-RW discs at 10x speed (1.46 megabytes/s), and read from CD discs at 32x speed (4.69 megabytes/s).\n\nThe 1x speed rating for CDs (150 kilobytes/s) is not to be confused with the 1x speed rating for DVDs (1.32 megabytes/s).\n\nIdeally for writing a cd dont go for writing speeds more than 16X and for DVD dont go for writing speeds more than 12X",380

4,"what kind of graphics card will suit an IBM ThinkPad notebook? ; Hi, \n\nI currently own an IBM ThinkPad notebook and am curious to find out what to look for when choosing a graphics card. I've read up on ExpressCards and CardBus interface, but no go, they're apparently used for devices such as modems, hard drives, gigE etc. The IBM ThinkPad has a PCI express graphics bus interface. Would i have to physically open the laptop to install the card, just like installing one on a desktop?

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

2,"I Have Been Told That I Have A Heart Murmur,But It Doesn't Sound Like What Is Decribed As A Normal Murmur? ; My new doctor discovered a heart mumur about a month ago.She said it was nothing .An innocent murmur,but my understanding of a murmur is a sound that happens between the lub dub .My mumur is an extra sound that is heard every fifth beat, like a lub dub  a dub ,I am confused about the sequence and wondering  if there is more that perhaps she didn't hear  when I was there in her office.She diagnosed me as PTSD and said that the stress could be causing the mumur but lately if I get up too early and don't get enough rest I get a headache and feel like its hard for me to breathe.I also recently visitied a ent which  couldnt find any type of artery blockage or ear problems but also said he heard turbulent blood flow. I can't really get a straight answer  about  what either doctor heard ,but neither seem to think that I had a problem.I was just wondering  if the sound that im hearing every fifth beat is what they are referring to? Please only if you are medical or have direct knowledge of it? ; First off, a murmur is simply turbulent blood flow and sounds like a 'whoosh'. The lub and the dub are valves closing, first the atrio-ventricular valves and then the aortic and pulmonary.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two kinds of murmur; systolic and diastolic. A systolic murmur, when the ventricles are contracting, is a murmur between the lub and the dub, and can be aortic or pulmonary stenosis or mitral or bicuspid regurgitation. A diastolic murmur is one between the dub and the lub and can be aortic or pulmonary regurgitation or mitral or bicuspid stenosis. There can also be murmurs that occur throughout the cardiac cycle.\n\nBased on what you have described, it doesn't sound as if you have a murmur, an occasional third heart sound is suggestive of a number of other things. A diagnosis can only be made with the benefit of an ECG and maybe an echocardiogram.\n\nGood luck, hope this helps.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo answer the follow up, I don't know, that's really beyond my knowledge. Some murmurs are harmless and are actually best left untreated. If two doctors are happy with you, I wouldn't worry too much about what someone like me says here.

I have taken tricyclics, SSRIs and what they refer to as atypicals (like Effexor).  I know hundreds of people who take them through my work and they are fine.  The antidepressants allow them to function more comfortably while hopefully they work on other ways of dealing with life and the causes of the depression or other disorder.\n\nBut...as to what we know long term...I asked my doctor the same thing and he said, and I agree, we do not know.  The trycyclics have been around a while, but they are not given much anymore.

I just don’t understand why…if people do in fact believe the vague religions premises for these holidays why do they lie. All thorough the bible it states that lying=bad   truth=good. John had a lot to say about lying vs. telling the truth but the tone is there throughout the bible: John 8:32 John 8:44 John 4:23, 24\n\nI’m not touching on the biblical principals vs. the pagan influences of Christmas or Easter or whatever holiday that promotes lying to children I just would like to know why good and decent people make the mistake of lying to kids only to reveal the truth when they are older. \n\nWhy do parent’s lie? ; well...to tell you the truth.....i really dont know y they do that...its pretty much gay...bcoz they give someone else credit for all that stuff that they buy their kids!!!.....but if i were to give you an answer..(this is what my parents used to say when i asked y they lied) i would have to say just to give christmas a little more *magic*...bcoz if it was just for jesus's b-day they prolly wouldnt care.....i mean y would they get all excited about the day he was born.....i for sho wouldnt...the only b-day i looked forward to was mine(of course), and my friend chelsea's(she always had parties at hotels lol).....anyways....yeah....tahts y they lie about santa...bcoz they want their kids to look forward to seeing this big fat guy in a red suit deliver presents all around the world....bcoz frankly THEY DONT CARE ABOUT JESUS'S BDAY!!..and the smae thing is wiht Easter...they want the big ol mr easter bunny to give them candy filled eggs......they dont care about his crucifiction...they care about the gifts and condy and all that good stuff!!!!  hope this helped(lol i know i babble on about bs crap..sorryy!!:D)",416

And arizona completely abandoded the run last week rushing a total of 6 times for a measely 8 yards.

The others give me no problems at all. ; I'm a registered dental hygienist and there is no way to tell  how long a person can hold out w/ getting a filling. I would say if you don't see holes in your teeth when you look in the mirror, you can probally wait til september as long as u are brushing twice a day, everyday, and stay away from cigarettes and Mountain Dew. If u see holes in your teeth, I would get it done ASAP, before u wake up w/ a tooth ache on a Sunday morning or a Holiday when noone is at the office. FYI- If u ever get a toothache DO NOT LAY DOWN. Your blood will rush to your head and cause the tooth to ache even more!!! Good Luck",432

It runs in my family, and it's embarassing to wear shirts because people ask if i'm pregnant WHEN I'M NOT. help i'm 13, 5'4 and 120 lbs. it's been puffy ever since i was born HELOP! ; I've had the same difficulty you have.  At the age of 29, I am able to embarass the asker by saying, ""no honey, it's just fat"" when they ask how many months pregnant I am...  But from my own experience at your age, I remember that they just won't believe you in school.  \n\nThe only things I can tell you follow the lines of your other answerers.  The crunches are a good start, and they can work well with other torso exercises.  (However, be sure you ""sit-up"" as you exhale or it can make the problem worse!)  The torso exercises are usually some form of exercise involving small weights (3lb or so, you don't want to bulk up!) and doing repetitive movements swinging from side/down to opposite side/up.  \n\nYou also might want to try walking, paired with arm swinging.  It looks strange, but if you have the bent elbows and actually move them consciously -- not just swinging by reflex -- it's supposed to help your torso get into shape.  There are also elastic stretch-bands that you can use to do leg exercises, and these will help tone as well.  \n\nOne other thing is the water suggestion.  You know the old health suggestion to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day?  Well, that's not caffeinated soda -- it's water!  Caffeine is a problem in this also.  Water will literally help to ""wash out"" your system, and initially it may help you to lose 5 lbs and its corresponding inches quickly.  It also keeps you hydrated and feeling like you have more energy, which will help you to become more active.  Moving around can help with that also.  \n\nLast, you are 13 and likely in your growth spurt stages now, and the abdomenal muscles will likely slim down as you grow.  Some of the ""pudgy"" people I knew in elementary and junior high school became the very slender people in high school!  At your age, it's never too early to begin exercising and drinking water -- but don't go to any extremes or begin starving yourself.  The exercise and water should help you now, and it will continue to be helpful all your life if you make it a regular habit.",474

If you don't live in Nevada and you decide to do business in the state in which you live your Nevada corporation would be considered an alien Corporation in your state. You would have to pay an additional fee for your state to allow your alien Corporation to do business in your state.

Also, if you use someone's internet, with your computer is there a way they could see what you did? Is there a way to prevent it? ; You can't gain full access to someone's PC with just their IP address.  It will help a resourceful hacker on their way to maybe gaining information about you, but it's not just that simple.  IP addresses are very similar to phone numbers.  You have to have one in order to communicate on the Internet, and everyone you deal with on the Internet (i.e. Yahoo.com, Microsoft.com, google.com, etc) will get your IP address so that they can return information to you.  It's impossible to not let anyone get your IP address, that's just not the nature of how things work.  So long as you update your operating system (namely visiting windowsupdate.com if you use Windows), then you are estimated about 95% safe from all typical attacks that anyone may try with you.  If you are concerned about the remaining percentage, purchase firewall software, or a firewall device if you are using a broadband connection (a router is typically also a firewall).\nAs for the second part of your question, by ""using someone's Internet"", I will assume you mean plugging your computer in to their broadband connection.  This will depend on their set up.  If they have a router, or if you are using a wireless connection, it is possible for the data you transmit and receive to be nabbed and cataloged for review later.  This is where encryption comes in handy.  If you are using wireless, make sure you use WEP which will encode all your data in such a way that it can't be captured.  Before signing in to web sites, make sure you have the lock icon. \nThere is no 100% guaranteed safe Internet connection, but with these steps, you'll be as close as you need to be.  Think of it like locking and dead-bolting your front door.  After doing that, you're not going to sit there all night and worry that someone will break in through the windows, right?

As a child of mass 25.0 kg stands at a distance of 1.00 m from the axle, the system (merry-go-round and child) rotates at the rate of 14.5 rev/min. The child then proceeds to walk toward the edge of the merry-go-round. What is the angular speed of the system when the child reaches the edge? ; One revolution = 2pi radians.  One minute = 60 seconds.  So 1 rev/min = 2pi/60 rad/s.  Multiply 11.2 rev/min by 2pi/60 to get 1.17286 rad/s.",577

1,"in case of lizard when it loses it's tail or it's body part it grows after a short period of time..? ; how is it possible? why can't this happens 4 humans? ; Most lizards have a characteristic called autotomy: they can lose a part of their tail (usually at times of danger from predators) as a defense mechanism and it grows back (however, the regenerated structure is not exactly the same as the original tail). They cannot grow other body parts back. \nThe ability to regenerate is present in most ""lower"" (as in having simpler organization) animals, but also in some vertebrates such as fish and amphibians. The acquisition or loss of this ability has to do with the evolutionary paths of each type of organism and thus your question does not have a simple answer. At a macromolecular/genetic level, we lack some genes (or they're inactivated) that are necessary for regeneration to occur.\nSome of these genes have been identified in animals that have regenerative ability:\nhttp://pda.physorg.com/lofi-news-genes-planarian-alvarado_3953.html",588

4,"how do i resolve undetermined externals in C++ ?? ; I am working on a project right now.. and i am getting 1 unresolved external error.. what can i do to fix this? ; There are a few typical reasons for unresolved\nexternals in C++.  \n\nThe simplist cause is that you forgot to link in a\nrequired library.  I'm not proficient with Windows,\nbut on a Unix/Linux/Solaris machine, you can search\nthrough libraries using ""nm"" to find the missing\nsymbol (and then specify that library on your linker\ninvocation).\n\nMaybe the next simplist cause would be that you\nactually are missing a symbol (ie. because of an\n#ifdef or some oversight in your Makefile, some\nsource file didn't compile).  Look for the symbol\nin the source and make sure that file is correctly\ncompiled.  [By the way, it is quite possible that\nyour linker will report ""mangled"" names which\nincorporate the class hierarchy of the type of\nthe symbol.  You may wish to filter your linker\noutput through something to reconstitute the\noriginal symbol name.  On many systems, this filter\nis called ""c++filt"", but I've also seen it called\n""dem"" (as in demangler).]\n\nFinally, in C++, I've seen another cause of unresolved\nsymbols being short-comings in the template instantiation\nsystem.  In the general case, the compilation system\nshould detect the use of templates and create the\nnecessary versions where and when needed, but some\ncompilers provide more limited support.  In those cases,\nit may be necessary to explicitly instantiate the \nmissing template.  Take a good look at the unresolved\nsymbol (particularly if you can ""demangle"" the name)\nto see if it looks like it should be provided by one\nof your (or the system's) templates.  That would be\nthe clue that this is an instantiation problem.",592

In terms of lots of chances, GER-POL and GHA-CZE are probably the best; in those games, Germany and Ghana really pressed forward and had exciting moments in front of goal, while Poland and the Czech Republic were able to get good counter-attacks against them, which was fun to watch.  GER-CRC had lots of goals, and was closer than the final score suggests.  TUN-SDA was just had a great second half, with a very late equalizer.  POR-NED was pretty exciting in part because it was a close game, but mainly because the referee made a spectacle of himself.

4,"What is AJAX? And how does it work? ; Please describe. I have only a vague idea ; Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and\nXML. It is a method by which user’s interaction with  any application happens independentaly of communication with the server. Ajax engine consisting of javascripts gets downloaded on to the browser when a user opens a web page and act as an go between the the server and the user's browser. Every user action that normally would generate an HTTP request takes the form of a JavaScript call to the Ajax engine instead. Any response to a user action that doesn’t require a trip back to the server — such as simple data validation, editing data in memory, and even some navigation — the engine handles on its own. If the engine needs something from the server in order to respond — if it’s submitting data for processing, loading additional interface code, or retrieving new data — the engine makes those requests asynchronously, usually using XML, without stalling a user’s interaction with the application.\n\najax is being used by google for its various services like Gmail,Google Suggest. You must have noticed in Gmail that when you type in the address box you get the address list as suggestions as soon as you type. This is through Ajax",604

After the patients trust is gained, the patients and doctor then try to overcome compulsive behavior, a hard thing for any BPD to accomplish.\nAll in all, a borderline personality makes it difficult for others to assist in that they see everything in black and white; a person who is not their hero is their enemy, and can quickly become one or the other.",625

I have finished college and grad school.  Having been accepted at a very big-name university for grad school, I can tell you that the place you do your undergrad is not as crucial as you may believe.  You do not need to go to an Ivy to have a great career or to get into an excellent grad school.  So my advice is to relax a little.  The ""top"" colleges are so competitive that there is no way to guarantee admission, no matter how amazing your application looks.\n\nI would guess that either IB or AP will give you an edge.\n\nSleep is very important.

1,"if the space shuttle had a nuclear reactor on board, then it slows down and re-enter earth's atmosphere no hea ; is the heat problem upon re-entry of the shuttle because we do not have the power to match the earth's rotation exactly then re-enter? ; Yes the heat is because the shuttle is going about 17,000 mph or more.  But think about it... if we caused it to slow down to the earth's rotational speed, it would drop like a stone!  The shuttle is very non-aerodynamic, it's like flying a brick with small wings.  Without the speed, it would be impossible to maneuver it to base because after entering the atmosphere it's like a big clumsy glider.\n\nIf we were to glide in gently under power like a jet, it would have to be much more aerodynamic. So it's possible, and the people working on the X prize are doing just that.  \n\nBut you will not find nuclear energy on a spaceship any time soon.

That's generally the number one problem I see in students that are having trouble motivating themselves to study - they're just not interested enough in the material.  If you're still a freshman or a sophomore and struggling with your lib ed requirements, that's understandable - but, if you're also having trouble studying for the classes in your major, then you may want to reassess.  I was in the same boat as you about 5 years ago.  Every time I tried to sit down and study, this wave of lethargy would sweep over me, making me very tired.  I've never napped so much as I did those first couple years of college.  I finally realized that I had less than no interest in the classes I was supposed to be really interested in, and took some time off to figure things out.  I'm not saying you necessarily need to stop going to school, but if your classes aren't exciting you, perhaps you should go talk to one of the academic advisors for undecided students.  They're trained to help you figure out what you're really interested in.  Good luck!",676

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

That doesn't mean there aren't exploits for Firefox but most of them are harmless and will just cause Firefox to crash and all you have to do is clear the cache and restart Firefox, no harm done.  The reason IE is so terrible is because the ActiveX controls are tied into the operating system so it is possible should an exploit be present, for someone to hijack your system.

1,"Why is there are sonic boom when planes make the sound barrier? ; What causes the sound? ; A sonic boom is the audible component of a shock wave in air. The term is commonly used to refer to the air shocks caused by the supersonic flight of military aircraft or passenger transports such as Concorde (Mach 2.03, no longer flying) and the Space Shuttle (Mach 27, has only flown once since the 2003 crash). Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion; typically the shock front may approach 167 megawatts per square meter, and may exceed 200 decibels.\n\nWhen an aircraft is near the sound barrier, an unusual cloud sometimes forms in its wake. A Prandtl-Glauert Singularity results from a drop in pressure, because of shock wave formation. This pressure change causes a sharp drop in temperature, which in humid conditions leads the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets and form the cloud",732

THANK YOU!! ; 1. Find x to the nearest length\nWhat would x be if it is a right triangle with the cos angle at 32º,sin angle at 58º and a hypotenuse length at 10\n\ncos 32 = x/10\n\nSo x = 8.48\n\n2.Find the missing side lengths for x and y.\nthe triangle is a 30-60-90 and it has a hypotenuse of 8. the sin leg is x and the cos leg is y\n\nsin30=x/8\nx = 4\n\ncos30 = y/8\ny = 4√3\n\n3. a ladder 18 feet long makes an angle of 61º with the ground as it leans against a barn. How far up the side of the barn does the ladder reach?\n\nThe ladder leaning against the barn makes a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 18.\n\nLet x be the height of the triangle.

6,"How can you raise you credit score even when you pay on time? ; Ok, past credit messed me up. I have a judgement thats almost paid off. I am trying to raise my credit score.I have 3 new accounts that I've paid on time for over 1 year. I read that one way to raise your score is to "" piggy back"" on a relatives good credit ( have them add me to one of their good accounts and not use it) Is this safe, is it legal. I would love to hear constructive ways to increase my credit score. Please don't judge me. Almost all of my "" bad"" credit accounts have been paid off. I put my sons first when the divorce came. They lived in the house that I paid for while I lived in a basement. ; Here are a couple of things you can do to raise your credit score quickly. \n\n1) Have a relative with great credit add you to their credit card account. This can raise your score over 100 points instantly, and has not risk to them! Even though your relative can add your name to their credit card account, they don't have risk if they don't give you a credit card.\n\n2) Use your credit cards for monthly purchase, then pay balance down to zero every month. If you have the cash, this is a very quick way to raise your credit score. Remember, creditors cannot ""see"" your income from the credit report, but they can tell you have financial strength when you pay down your card balances every month. This technique can raise your credit score up to 80 points.\n\n3) Use time. Most people don't realize that a bad credit item has the most weight only in the first two months, then hurts your score even less after 6 months, and even less after 2 years. After 2 years, many bad credit items don't even hurt at all. I know a friend with 6 chargeoffs that are 4-6 years old and her credit score is 620, good enough to buy a house. Sometimes waiting even a month or two for a bad item to age is all you need for your credit score to bounce back. \n\nIt doesn't mean you are a bad person when you have a lower credit score. Bad things just happen. Good luck with your credit score!",748

My friend who is a year older and went there told me that ""everyone"" plays Ultimate at Stuy. Being impressionable and younger, I figured I better learn too. I played for the boys' Sticky Fingers team through high school. I got to play at the high school national championships back when it was held in Washington DC.\n\nAfter high school, I went to Oberlin College in Ohio. I continued my Ultimate career by attending early season tryouts for the college team. There were barely enough people on the team to play 7-on-7 full size games. We played co-ed (mixed gender) in the fall, then single-gender in the spring (collegiate championships season). I eventually went on to captain the team, and the men's team made it to College Nationals.\n\nAfter college, I moved to Seattle, Washington, where I tried out for, but didn't make the second tier men's club team. I spent a season getting serious about training, and eventually made it onto one of the second tier teams. Continuing on with training, I eventually made it on to the top men's team in town. The team qualified for the club national championships where we finished second - losing to some team from Boston in the finals. I was put in for one point that game. (Which was pretty good considering there were earlier elimination games I didn't play in at all.)\n\nI eventually played for another evolution of a second tier men's team in town. After a few fun seasons with that team, I went on to start a co-ed (mixed gender) team.

4,"Is a VCD in mpg file format different from a VCD in dat file format? (Techs only)? ; I have a situation here. I converted .avi file into .mpg using TMPGEnc converter. I burned the files onto a CD/R. I tried to play the VCD on the VCD Player but it doesn't recognize the disk. However, it does recognize a VCD with .dat file formats such as Avseq1.dat, Avseq2.dat in Mpegav folder. How do i convert .avi into .dat? Which software? OR is there anything i can do with the VCD i made? ; No, it is completely the same. It is basically only file renaming. But you cannot just rename mpg files into dat then burn it into CD hoping VCD player can read it. You have to follow the VCD standard. Like the resolution should be 352x288 or 352x240, only accept 30fps (for PAL) or 25fps (for NTSC) you also have to use 1150kpbs as the bitrate.\nIf you don't want to create this manually. Many programs offer straight conversion into VCD format (that is still mpg or MPEG-1). The popular one is Nero 7. See it on www.nero.com. It includes a program to convert video files into VCD format, just click and it's done! This program can also convert avi files into VCD format.\nSorry, there's nothing you can do with the VCD that you've made, you must reencode the files and burn a new VCD.

The air pulls the moisture out of the mucous membranes in your nostrils causing them to crack (It makes the walls of the veins thinner which contributes to the cracking effect.) and thus bleed.  Winter is the worse time for this...My husband has already had three this year. I use just a small amount of Carmex on a Q-Tip to moisturize his nose. I also put a small kettle of water on the stove on low to ""rehydrate"" the air versus expensive humidifiers. Just make sure you don't leave it on at night or that the kettle runs dry...\n\nStress can also cause nosebleeds. Elevated blood preasure can cause the vessels to burst. Also, when people are chronically stressed they don't eat well or hydrate properly which can cause chronic nosebleeds. Try taking a multivitamin, getting enough liquids, and adequate rest and relaxation. Combined with the ""dry air"" treatment I described above you shouldn't have a problem.\n\nIf the problem persists for more than a few months, happens more than three times a week, happens even after above treatments, is painful, or bleeds excessively and won't quite call your doctor as this may be a sign of something serious.

9,"what (see details)? ; what the difference between the office of prime minster and president( some countries like iraq have both) ; A President is an executive, meaning they oversee the enactment of laws. Sometimes, like in the US, the President has certain power over legislation, in the form of a veto, but that is fairly limited. The President is elected by name. That is, you don't vote for ""Republican"" not knowing who the President might actually end up being.\n\nA Prime Minister, on the other hand, is a member of parliament and has no power to enforce laws. He is the head of the parliament and directs the creation of laws. Further, he is not elected by name. Instead, people vote for individual representatives in parliament for their district (like how we vote for Representatives), and the party that receives a majority of seats (or coalition of parties if none has a majority) votes for who among them should be prime minister.\n\nIn countries that have both, the President has very little power and is mainly a ceremonial position, much like the Queen in England.",876

4,"Wireless Connection Keeps Disconnecting? ; I have a laptop that works perfectly when connected to my wireless network; however, whenever I am connected to a friend's network, I am constantly kicked off every 30 seconds or so.  The other people using this network don't have any problems.  Is this a configuration issue? ; It might be a configuration issue or as the other person stated a problem with the access point you are trying to connect to as well.   Part of the answer will depend how on well you know your equipment and the equipment your trying to connect to.  There are multiple versions of the 802.11 versions out there. A B G N as previously mentioned, I don't believe N has been ratified yet, and it is unlikely you have A.  Probably 802.11B or 802.11G which are pretty standard installs in most machines.  You can start by making sure that you are compatibale with the access point your are trying to connect to.  Wireless networks can be set to only accept clients from certain bands, such as only G or B clients.  If your sure you have interoperability, then check to make sure the SSID or the broadcast name of the AP is also setup in your machine.  Most SSIDs are broadcast openly and will allow a machine to connect even if the connection is unsecured and will do this automatically.  If the SSID is not broadcasting you'll have to get the name and setup a new SSID.  I have noticed on XP that sometimes, it will note the connection is unsecured and wants confirmation before connection is established.  There are diagnostic tools in most laptop machines that will give you more information that will help decide where your problem is coming from.  If the connection is not using defaults, you may be experiencing issues from a security standpoint.  More advanced users will setup security on the AP itself which will require a WEP key before connection is established.  You'll have to find out if this is the case.  Another common problem I have seen with people attempting to connect to an AP is ad-hoc networks.  People initally setting up a SSID will tell the machine to create a connection where the laptop/machine itself becomes similar to a AP although more for a peer-to-peer connection, without ever realizing it.  If your familiar with XP, it uses different icons to distinguish between ad-hocs and APs.  If you are getting stronger connection to an ad-hoc and have not told your machine to connect to an AP infrastructure by default it can also attempt to use the ad-hoc before the AP.  ( Change this on the Advanced button on the bottom of the Wireless network connection properties window.)  On a XP machine, it will usually give you an indicator in the taskbar on the right, with some idea of what might be wrong.  If your connection is leaving you without an IP address you might try to verify that the connection you are trying to establish is the correct one.  Worst comes to worse, remove all the SSIDs that are located under the wireless network connection properties window and try to reconnect.  Right clicking on the wireless icon will also give you the option to View Available Wireless Networks, which might also give you an idea of the problem.\nI am of course assuming your running an XP machine and are familiar enough to find most of the spots I have mentioned.\nHope this helps you figure out your problem.",879

My chem teacher is really old and he doesnt explain things well at all. Any help would be greatful! =) ; Okie dokie. First, you balance out the equation. You want to make sure you have the same amount of sodium, phospohorous, and oxygen atoms on each side of the ""yield"" sign. The outcome could be 12Na+P(little 4)+8O(little 2) Yields 4(Na(little 3)PO(little4)). Then you use your periodic table to tell you how many grams per mole are in Na(little3)PO(little 4). The molar mass is 164 g. You only have 156 g, which means you have 0.95 moles (156/164). Now you know that you have half as many moles of oxygen, therefore you only have 0.475 moles of O2. Now all you have to do is do 0.475 moles of O(;little 2) multiplied by its molar mass, which is 32 grams. This will give you 15.2 grams of O(little 2).

That's a personal decision though so that's all I will say about that. \n\nLook at it this way though... there are alot worse things that a doctor could tell you than that you are diabetic. I know it's bad enough in itself, but diabetes does not have to be a death sentence. The initial diagnosis is very scary and intimidating, but it's a very controllable condition and you can live a long, healthy, happy, and productive life with it. \n\nBeing diabetic doesn't mean that you are terminally ill.

I am personally a Type 2 diabetic (I'm 24 years old) and it has changed my life, but I do not let it control my life.

1,"whats -16x squared + 80x + 3? ; i think u have to solve it by binomiels but i cant think of 2 numbers that multiple to 16 and add to 80. its a parabala and i have to graph it please help ; y = -16x^2 +80x +3\n\nFirst of all, it is a negative quadratic function, so, you expect this quadratic function to open downwards. Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943

6,"i need advice on how to make money on real estate buy remodel and sell? ; i have 10 + years carpentery exp drywall painting hardwood floor install sand finish ; Remember you only make money when you BUY a property, not when you sell it.  That means that you have to ""make"" your money when you buy the house.  Make sure you have enough equity in the house upfront to:\n\n1.  Repair the house for sale.  This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950

2,"Is it healthy to lose about 3 lbs a week? ; I'm trying to lose 37 lbs in 14 weeks and I would need to lose 2.8 lbs a week.  Is this healthy or too much?  I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963

2,"Mirena or Paraguard? Which is more healthy? Are there significant amounts of hormones in the Mirena IUD? ; I have had problems with the Pill's hormones and having migranes. I went off the Pill and now I don't experience the migraines I used to. I want to get an IUD but don't know which one would be best for my health. Do the hormones in the Mirena IUD cause migraines in anyone? I know that Mirena is the most effective, I just don't want to suffer with migraines because of it. Advice please. ; Mirena IUD:\nHow it works:  It is inserted into the uterus and is about the size of a quarter.  Mirena contains a type of progestin called levonorgestrel, which blocks sperm and alters the lining of the uterus, interrupting implantation of a fertilized egg.  Modern IUD's don't pose a high risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.  In fact, the hormone in Mirena helps shrink uterine fibroids, decreases menstrual cramping, can reduce blood loss by 97% and may lower your risk of endometrial cancer. If the birth control pill you were taking contained levonorgestrel then you might get migraines from the IUD, but it is unlikely since you are not ingesting the hormone.  It provides protection for 5 years.\n\nParagard IUD:\nHow it works: It is inserted the same way as Mirena, but it works differently; instead of hormones, Paragard contains copper, which kills sperm.  It provides protection for 10 years. Research shows that Paragard may lower your risk of developing endometrial cancers, though experts aren't sure why.  \n\nThere is also an an implant that is not yet available, but will be soon, called Implanon.  A single matchsticklike implant is inserted into your upper arm.  The implant, which should be approved by the FDA this year, releases a low dose of Progestin into your body. It blocks ovulation and thickens cervical mucus so the sperm cannot enter for up to three years.  It is 100% effective, whereas the Paragard and Mirena is only 99% and 99.9% effective.",965

CRM systems are integrated end-to-end across marketing, sales, and customer service.\n\nA CRM system should:\n\nIdentify factors important to clients. \nPromote a customer-oriented philosophy \nAdopt customer-based measures \nDevelop end-to-end processes to serve customers \nProvide successful customer support \nHandle customer complaints \nTrack all aspects of sales \nCreate a holistic view of customers' sales & services information",1083

I have Mac OS Extended. ; A G3 isn't exactly the lastest in computer technology.

You most likely have a ton of spyware on your system that's sending nformation all over the net about you and your machine and your kids.  The best way to remove this is an antivirus program with spyware checkers (most of them have that now) or you can get a dedicated spyware checker like ad-aware but I'll prefer the antivirus so that you could scan for viruses as well.

6,"Has anyone gone to ""Tax Lien Certificate Auction"" before? ; If so, is it worth going to one of these? ; It may or may not be worth it depending on the circumstances. You can usually obtain a list several days prior to the auction to see what houses are on the list. The best houses will go for the least amount of interest because they have a better chance of returning on the money invested (meaning when the house sells, etc.) The scruffier the house looks the more risk you are taking when paying the tax certificate and therefor you will get a higher interest rate. Interest rates are determined by bid process starting at the top and bidding down. These can be a good investment if you play your cards right but most of the time you are locking up your money for long periods of time unknowing when you can release it. You will get your money back when the house is sold, the owner pays up, or after usually 2 years you can file for a tax deed auction and you will get your money back then. I think there are much better investments out there.",1119

Can a bat be swung that fast (160mph?)   If not, how fast?  Answers = greatly appreciated! ; There is no way that a human being can generate 150 mph bat speed in the 45/100ths of a second that it takes a 90 mile an hour fastball to travel from the pitcher's hand to the plate.\n\nTypical bat speeds are measured more in the 80s or 90s, but it may surprise you to know that faster bat speeds are not necessarily associated with balls that are hit for distance. In fact, the fastest bats generally belong to line drive and spray hitters like Ichiro, who can whip the bat through the zone, driving the ball on a line. Power hitters tend to use heavier bats, and consequently swing more slowly, allowing the bat to ""stay on the ball"" longer, and impart more force and impact to ""turning the ball around"".\n\nI've linked a couple of articles that discuss this - one is fairly hairy, and depends on a knowledge of physics - the other two are for general audiences, and fairly easy to understand.

Hematomas or contusions (or ""bumps"" and ""bruises"") develop when blood and scared tissue coagulates under the epidermis (top skin). \n\nHere is how to treat it:\n""For contusions (bruises), treatment consists of initially applying ice or cold packs a few times a day, to produce vasoconstriction (a reduction in arterial blood flow) which helps to decrease hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (swelling).\n\nIn general, the quicker you apply ice after the injury, the less bleeding will result.\n\nIf possible, elevate the bruised limb. Blood will leave the area of the wound and there may be less swelling. Resting the limb will also help to prevent further injury.\n\nIf the area is still painful after about 48 hours, apply gentle heat with warm towels, a hot water bottle, or a heating pad. The heat is applied for 20 minutes at a time to promote absorption and repair. Since heat causes swelling and increases tissue fluid, which may impair function, hot compresses may be followed by cold applications to minimize the secondary effects of heat.\n\nPressure in the form of an elastic adhesive bandage may be helpful to reduce hemorrhage and swelling. If infection should develop in the wound, the signs and symptoms might be increasingly severe pain, a fever of 101 degrees or more, swelling with surrounding redness, and pus. If any of these signs appear, your physician should be notified to make sure there are no additional problems.""",1180

2,"persistent shoulder pain, for years... should I get rotator cuff surgery? Your experiences with it? ; I have inflammation and pain in my rotator cuff, going back years.  Now that I'm actively weight training again, it's really bothering me and affecting my quality of life.  Before restarting weight training, the pain was merely a minor nuisance, something I could easily live with.  I had it looked at, and the doctors basically said I could come in and get steroid injections every couple of months to manage the pain, or I could have rotator cuff surgery.  I've talked to a few folks that have had the surgery, and NONE of them have anything good to say about it.  They said the post-operative pain was bad, and it took several months or longer to heal.  What do you think? ; Basically you have 2 choices stop doing activities that cause you pain or have the surgery.  The surgery consists of a plastic screw being inserted into the shoulder, the tendon is then weaved into another piece of flat plastic that is then attached to the screw to hold the tendon into place.  The recuperation time is around 6 months and you'll need physical therapy during that time.  It takes along time to heal because there's no way to actually reattach the tendon permanently.  The plastic just holds it into place while the tendon reattaches itself to the bone.  The pain of the surgery can be quite intense but pain medication is provided.\nHope this  helps.",1210
1,"Can you tell me interesting facts about an electric drill??? ; My 10 years old daughter wants to know more about the electric drill. ; Yes, what the others aswerers said is true, but if you really want interesting things to find out  you should look to the masonry drilling bits, because they work on totally different principle than normal drill bits (for wood, metal and so on).\n\nThe masonry doesn't behave like all other materials, meaning that's not plastic (it does not deform and remain deformed after that, but is a very little bit elastic), and also IS fragile , meaning that is cracking if the critical tension has been reached. Also is not homogeneous like other materials (actually is a composite material, made from pebbles, stones and cement in water).\nThat's why the drill bits for this kind of things act exactly like rotating chisel. It has an leading edge hat is acting axial (along the axis of the drilling bit) and the bit is made from the most strongest carbides (VC, TiC, WC, etc mixed with the metallic powder techniques).\nThat's only because a drill bit  made for wood/metal would be destroyed at the very first millimeters. \n\nIt's acting by hitting then rotating few degrees and then hitting again and so on (that's why I called it ""rotating chisel"" and its bit is acting along the axis of the drilling rod).\nThe metal/wood drilling bits are acting like knifes which are ""shaving"" the face of the material bit by bit, actually making a spiral (a continuous chip) with the chips no thicker than 1 millimeter, no matter the size of the drilling bits. In the same way the masonry drilling bits are not fitted to drill wood/metal.\n\nDfriend:)",1213

Lavasoft's free Ad-Aware is the best antispyware to my knowledge. Also Windows Defender from Microsoft is good enough for real-time protection). This should identify the problem and most probably would solve it as well. However, if the antivirus software is unable to delete the malware, go to thier website and search for the name of the malware detected. Their must be some instructions posted to tackle the problem. You might have to delete the system restore points and as well delete the particular registry entries manually if the virus still regenerates on subsequent boot up of the machine. Good Luck.\n\nPS. If you are still having trouble, use Hijack This and copy the log it generates and post it on some tech help forum. I am sure there will be plenty of people ready to help you out.",1230

They are independent of the states in which those reservations reside and could almost be considered as a form of even more independent state than those 50 that already exist. They have their own police forces, tribal governments, and laws. This is one reason why Indian tribes can have casinos or tobacco shops on their lands even when the state they reside in forbids gambling or charges higher tobacco taxes than the reservation does.

1,"Soil Conservation? ; CausesConsequencesSolutions\nSoil Erosion•••\nDesertification\n\nSalinization•••\n•••\n\nDescribing ways in which your lifestyle directly or indirectly contributes to Soil degradation. ; Erosion is the displacement of solids (soil, mud, rock, and other particles) by the agents of wind, water, ice, movement in response to gravity, or living organisms (in the case of bioerosion). Although the processes may be simultaneous, erosion is to be distinguished from weathering, which is the decomposition of rock. Erosion is an intrinsic natural process, but in many places it is increased by human land use. Poor land use practices include deforestation, overgrazing, unmanaged construction activity and road or trail building. However, improved land use practices can limit erosion using techniques like terrace-building and tree planting.\n\nA certain amount of erosion is natural and in fact healthy for the ecosystem. For example, gravels continually move downstream in watercourses. Too much erosion, however, can cause problems, clogging streams with gravel, filling reservoirs with sediment, reducing soil fertility and water\n \ncauses : What causes erosion to be severe in some areas and minor elsewhere? It is a combination of many factors, including the amount and intensity of precipitation, the texture of the soil, the gradient of the slope, ground cover (from vegetation, rocks, etc.) and land use. The first factor, rain, is the agent for erosion, but the degree of erosion is governed by other factors.\n\nThe first three factors can remain fairly constant over time. In general, given the same kind of vegetative cover, you expect areas with high-intensity precipitation, sandy or silty soils, and steep slopes to be the most erosive. Soils with a lot of clay that receive less intense precipitation and are on gentle slopes tend to erode less.\n\nThe factor that is most subject to change is the amount and type of ground cover. When fires burn an area or when vegetation is removed as part of timber operations, building a house or a road, the susceptibility of the soil to erosion is greatly increased.\n\ncontrol : Examples of some erosion control methods include:\n\nconservation tillage \ncontour plowing \ncover crops \ngabions \nhydroseeding \nreforestation \nriparian strips \nriprap \nstrip farming \nvegetated waterways \nterracing \nwattle (construction) \nwindbreaks",1267

6,"How long would it take me to pay off my mortgage early? ; If I owe 160,000 and the regular payment is 1600/month (including insurance) how long would it take to have it paid off? I got the 30 year loan 8 years ago. Should I pay it off early? ; That all depends on your financial situation, long-term goals, interest rate, etc...\n\nHere are some considerations:\n\n1) Your house is a LIABILITY - unless it puts money IN your pocket, it's a liability.  It's an asset on the BANK's balance sheet.  Tax write offs...sure, but look at how much interest you'll pay over the course of the loan.  Figure that you'll basically pay double for the loan.  If you can pay it off in 20 years vs 30, you'll save thousands in interest.  If you invested that into a mutual fund, real estate (rental property or buy/flip), you'd stand to make a lot more than a write off.\n\n2)  What's your overall debt situation?  Do you have lots of credit cards, loans, dept store cards, etc...?  If you can make the mortgage payments, and you have a lot of cc debt, it may make more sense to pay off the higher interest rate debt first.  \n\nConsult with a financial expert / tax expert etc... for specific advice.\n\nI would also point you to ""Smart Women / Couples Finish Rich"", by David Bach.

0,"Given that God acknowledges he slew his brother for the rape of his sister, whom he secretly desired...? ; and that he also slew his father.

All texts are set down by humans and therefore even if divinely inspired are subject to human fault. \n\n Then take into account which texts you are mixing.  You have the 10 commandments which are a pretty good guide to running a community or nation, simple compact given at one point in time.  Then other texts that are from different time periods, and different writers.  Even if inspired by God is it really likely that God has a brother and sister, or are these just negative examples given for human learning?\n\nEven so, does it make someone hypocritical to as another to learn from his/her mistakes.  A hypocrite in my definition is one who continues to do an action he/she thinks is negative.  If it was once done and not repeated it is simply good advice.  Not hypocritical.\n\nAnd Moe, if he is talking of earlier scriptures that would be referring to old testament and before, which has nothing to do with Jesus.  Jesus actually had many brothers and sisters from Mary and Joseph.",1288

Success is promised to those who adhere to the Qur'aan and Sunnah, following the guidance and keeping away from prohibitions. All the issues we face in today's complex world are put into their proper context as we keep ourselves under the shade of Allah, the Most Merciful.\n   There is no doubt that the offensive cartoons are part of the propaganda which accompanies warfare.

Christians or even JW don’t allow for the celebrating of demons. \nMother’s day and Father’s Day- This is just basics, the commandments say we should honor our Father and Mother… That means all the time not one just a special day.\nBirthday- Here is where the JW’s get a little strange; in a birthday celebration for King Herod a young girl pleases him with her dance.

2,"smoking question? ; Ok so I want to quit smoking, I have smoked for about 10 years.  I need some advice on how you all did it and also what were some of your experiences. ; I quit after 38 years by using nicotine replacement + a support group.  I was highly motivated to quit because I was scheduled for elective surgery and I understood that stopping smoking was the single best thing I could do to increase my chances for a successful surgical outcome.  \n\nResearch has indicated that using nic replacement increases the successs rate of quit attempts.  I had tried to stop cold turkey several times but always fell off the wagon and had given up trying - until my surgery date was looming.  Amazing how that motivates a person!\n\nI never tried this drug but some quitters have also been helped by using the drug Wellbutrin, a prescription medication.  Some have combined it with nic replacement to increase their chance of success.\n\nI guess the best advice I could give is that if you fail, try again.  Every attempt to quit, whether you last a week or a month, gives you useful experience and information about your habit and what smoking does for you that can help you the next time you try.  Don't stop trying.\n\nOn the issue of weight gain, I found that I have a strong oral craving - if it isn't a cigarette in my mouth, then it's food.  With oral nic replacement products (gum or lozenges) there is less likelihood that you'll overeat because the oral cravings are somewhat satisfied by the nic replacement product.  This isn't the case, of course, with the patch.  I didn't gain weight during the time I used nic gum.  I did gain about 10 lbs later.  Unless you eat yourself out of house and home, there is no reason to gain a lot of weight (I don't consider 10 lbs. a lot of weight).  However, if you eat instead of smoking, then yes, gaining weight is likely.  I took up walking instead of smoking.  Anything but eating!",1344
1,"How does Newton's Law of motion affact a submarine go???!!? ; PLEASE HELP ME><"""" ; Newton's Laws of Motion describe only the motion of a body as a whole and are valid only for motions relative to a reference frame. \nFirst law - An object at rest tends to stay in rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion in a straight line at constant speed unless acted upon by an external, unbalanced force - like those big propellers. \nSecond law - The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and is in the same direction. Which is why a really big submarine needs really big propellers to go.\nThird law - To every action (force applied) there is an equal but opposite reaction (equal force applied in the opposite direction).   So if the propeller pushes against the water one way, the propeller and the ship it is attached to move the other way.",1346

3,"If you asked to write asucessful essay about &#92;ascool to give the students the skillsand knowwledges needed ; elements can include , but are not limited to iportant physical chracteristics of the school ; Well first, you need to be sure your grammar and spelling are impeccable so people will take you seriously. Second your question is a fragment and does not make much sense. I think you are asking what skills and knowledge should be included in a school to make it successful? If that is the case there are hundreds of possible answers. My opinion on this matter is not always liked but it would be effective. Here is what I think (you best be careful with stealing ideas though as much of this is written in a paper I did). First, you need a sound building in which to house your school so the kids will be safe, secure, and have an environment conducive to learning. You also need to be sure the building is located in an area that will serve the students you wish to serve.\nSecond, you need a well developed curricular objective. What is the purpose of your school? Vision statement? Goals? Objectives? among other questions. You also need to define what your school is. Is it a private school or a public school or something in the middle? \nSkills wise I believe we need to concentrate on the basics FIRST. Reading, Writing, Math, Science, and Social Studies are the most important subjects. Depending on the focus of your school will depend on which are the most important. The federal government would argue with you that Reading and Math are most important but I do not believe you place one core subject above another. I also believe schools do not do enough with teaching students to WRITE a good sentence, paragraph, essay, or paper. \nOther than those basic assumptions of a school it comes down to the focus of your educational mission. If your school is a high school geared toward technology then you should be providing students with skills in the fields of technology. If your school is a middle school that is to prepare students to get into a particular high school then you should tailor your program towards the requirements of that school. If you are a college prep school then you need to immerse your students in college prep classes to build the skills necessary for college study. This could go on forever!\n\nStart with a mission plan, goal, and objectives to establish your educational mission. Then the rest will flow off of that thought.\n\nhope that helps....",1398

Antartica is also a desert.\n\nIn geography, a desert is a landscape form or region that receives little precipitation. Generally deserts are defined as areas that receive an average annual precipitation of less than 250 mm (10 inches).\n\nDeserts have a reputation for supporting very little life. Compared to wetter regions this may be true, although deserts often have high biodiversity, including animals that remain hidden (especially during the daylight) to preserve moisture. About one-fifth of Earth's land surface is desert.\n\nDesert landscapes have certain features. Deserts are often composed of sand and rocky surfaces. Sand dunes called ergs and stony or hamada surfaces compose a minority of desert surfaces. Exposures of rocky terrain are typical, and reflect minimal soil development and sparseness of vegetation. Bottom lands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian (wind-driven) processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Cold deserts have similar features but the main form of precipation is snow rather than rain. The largest cold desert is Antarctica (composed of about 98 percent thick continental ice sheet and 2 percent barren rock). The largest hot desert is the Sahara.",1406
2,"Does anybody know about the graysheet diet? ; I heard that this was a diet that OA used years ago. ; Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.\nFood-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one ""specific"" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.\n\nHigh-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are ""bad"" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.\n\nHigh-fiber, low-calorie diets: As I've noted in many previous blog entries, fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.\n\nLiquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long‑term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.\n\nFasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health. \nNo fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start: \nEat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients. \n\nGet some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep ""calories out"" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.\n\nInclude sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.\n\nChoose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more t",1407

Like, maybe assurance of your love for him even though a new little one is coming to steal you away from him.\n\nAnd if he really wants to communicate with his father, maybe a phone call will be enough.  Or maybe let him make a card to send to his father.  That might be enough to satisfy him so he can move on.\n\nYou can also redirect his attention to something more tangible.  Like making another book, but this time with people he's close to and sees frequently.\n\nI think in the end, you'll just have to try things that are possible for you to do until you run out of options.

Well, here we are a week later, and upon numerous voice mail messages to my lawyer, as he hasnt been answering his phone, not only do I have no insight into when I will be receiving my settlement, I have yet to recieve any information. ie - settlement agreement.

He started setting up a bunch of welfare handout programs which was continued all the way through Johnson.

SCORE is a nonprofit association dedicated to entrepreneur education and the formation, growth and success of small business nationwide. \n\nAnother great resource is the US Small Business Association: \n\nhttp://www.sba.gov\n\nTheir start up guide: http://www.sba.gov/starting_business/startup/guide.html is a really good publication that should answer many of your questions.\n\nFinally, this website - http://sbdc.deltacollege.org/startup/ by San Joaquin Delta College Small Business Center is actually an online book that was developed to help prospective small business owners with the often overwhelming process of starting a business-- everything from writing a business plan to finding government contracts.

5,"Y is that the '82 Brazil team is consider by many the best BRAZL team even tho they didnt get to the final? ; Every one tells me that the 1982 brazil team is the best team ever even though they didn't win the championship, why??!!!!!!!!!! ; The 1982 Brazil team played some of the best attacking football ever seen, and has some great players in the team. Sitting back to defend just wasn't in their vocabulary, and in the build up to the world cup they swept all aside with some breath taking displays.\n\nThey started the world cup finals well too. They comfortably qualified top of their group, to enter a second group stage. They were unfortunate though, because in the second group stage they did not face weaker teams, as the draw had been designed to produce, but defending champions Argentina and Italy, both of whom had started slowly in the competition. However, they beat Argentina 3-1, and only needed a draw to progress to the next round against Italy.\n\nItaly started well, and scored an early goal, but Brazil piled on the pressure and brought the game back to 1-1. At this point, they only had to close up shop and see the game out - but that wasn't their mentality. They carried on attacking, and left themselves venerable at the back. The Italians scored again, and led until 20 minutes from the end, when Brazils attacking play finally made it 2-2.\n\nAnother defensive mistake was to blame for the third Italian goal, and thanks to some heroics from the Italian keeper Zoff, the game finished 3-2.\n\nBrazil had been knocked out, but had played some superb football and had, perhaps, reminded people across the world how football could be played.\n\nFor this reason there 1982 team will always be remembered as one of the greatest teams of all time.",1506

She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

Normally, this would mean that Amelie could not gain any points at the same tourney this year, but for some reason the ranking points for this years WTA Championships were increased, giving the champ 525 points instead of last year's 485, so Amelie could have 40 more points in the Nov 13th rankings.\nThe victory by Martina Hingis over Nadia Petrova on Wednesday guaranteed that Justine Henin-Hardenne would finish no lower than third in the ""Yellow"" group at the Championships. This alone would be enough for Justine to edge out Amelie for the # 1 ranking, and thus Amelie could not finish the year at # 1.\n # 2 Maria Sharapova was in a somewhat better position. She had only 218 ""points to defend,"" and might have finished the year at # 1 by simply matching her performance of last year in reaching the semis--if Justine Henin-Hardenne had finished last in her round-robin group. But with her win over Nadia Petrova on Thursday, Justine clinched a place in the semifinals. That meant that Maria would have had to win the tourney to have a chance at finishing # 1. Justine's victory over Maria in the semis eliminated that possibility, and clinched the # 1 ranking for Justine.\nJustine Henin-Hardenne, who reached all 4 Grand Slam tourney finals this year, entered the tourney in the best position to finish the year at # 1. Maria Sharapova's loss in the semifinals (which happened to be a loss to Justine) meant that even if Justine had finished 3rd in her group, rather than reaching the final, she would have finished the year at # 1 anyway.",1543

You're going to replace the old hydrogen with some new hydrogen that's less dense? The only way for the density of hydrogen to be less is if the pressure is lower or the temperature is higher. Since this is a balloon, the pressure has to match the pressure of the atmosphere. \n\nSo I'll assume the new hydrogen is at a higher temperature. In that case, the balloon can be kept inflated to the same size with fewer molecules. Therefore the mass of the hydrogen will be less because there is less of it. So the bouyancy will increase.

1,"How can a spider, bug, ant etc. have a life behaviour of incredible complexity with such a small brain? ; For example, a spider can have a very complex behaviour similar to us, and even more spectacular: it hunts, build structures, have conflicts with other spiders, and even dance !\nA termite colony can live in complex societies, with over 10000 inhabitants. ; Invertebrates can manage this apparent degree of complexity because so much of their behaviour is instinctive. It is preprogrammed into their brains before hatching and is largely unchanging.  That method of storage is highly efficient because the macroscopic brain structure itself can be tailored to support it. This allows for very complex behaviours with relatively little brain mass. The downside is that the animals have little ability to learn and even less ability to respond to change.\n\nIn contrast mammals have very few preprogrammed behaviours, instead they learn most of what they need to know through experience. That makes mammals extremely flexible animals compared to most invertebrates because they can tailor all their behaviour to circumstances. The downside is that it requires a large brain to allow for all the possible circumstances the animal might meet.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider something like the ;structures’ that a spider builds. some species of spiders build complex silk baskets for their eggs. The basket consists of a ‘floor’ and a domed roof, complete with an escape hole for the hatchlings. They are very complex and very impressive without a doubt, but the spider makes them according to an inbuilt program. If that program is disrupted or indeed can not be initiated the spider simply can not cope. If a spider is disturbed just after it has constructed the floor of the basket it can’t simply start again. It has to complete the program cycle. It will spin the domed roof, then lay the eggs in there, and because there is no floor the eggs fall onto the ground an all die. \n\nCan you imagine a bird or squirrel that is disturbed hen it begins making its nest trying to build the sides of the nest on nothing? Nope, that’s because mammals and birds are flexible. The basic of nest building may be inbuilt, but the specifics are the result of learning and adaptations. \n\nAnd that is true of all invertebrate behaviour. An caterpillar will starve to death in a room full of food simply because the food doesn’t have any smell, or a spider that is prevented form spinning a web will starve even when given unlimited amounts of disabled but living insects because it can ONLY hunt when food is caught in a web. Bees will fight to the death to keep other insects out of their hive, but once they are inside the hive and acquire the right smell they will let other insects kill them and take no action at all.\n\nAnd the list of examples goes on and on. Bugs simply are not very adaptable creatures. If they experience something new they simply can not do anything about it at all. And although spiders, ants and so forth can learn their ability is extremely limited. They can exhibit complex behaviour in one limited way, but they can’t readily alter that behaviour. \n\nAnd that is why they can exhibit apparently complex behaviour with a small brain. The complexity is wired in, with no ‘waste’ space. But that comes at the expense of adaptability. In contrast mammals exhibit les complex behaviours but are infinitely more adaptable. Horses for courses.",1603

If this isn't possible, what's the next best thing? ; Sport -- I'm not a U.K. solicitor or barrister, but in the U.S., e-mails are regularly admitted in evidence for al kinds of purposes.  As you've noted, the difficulty is if someone denies that they sent the e-mail in question.  IN the U.S. we have rules for admissibility of evidence, but, generally, so long as there is someone who can testify that (a) the e-mail address is the one customarily used by the author and/or (b) there are certain charadteristics of the e-mail which indicate its source, then a court will likely admit the evidence.   If the other party denies the evidence, then that's a fact question for the factfinder (in the U.S., usually a jury) to resolve.\n\nSure, when wanting someone to be bound by ""their word"" -- getting something signed by them and notarized is the most solid (of course, that doesn't mean that the contract will necessarily be valid, as there are lots of reasons that a contract may be declared invalid, like lack of consideration, unconscionability / coercion, fraud, etc. etc.). Probably followed by a signed written document, signed in front of a witness (non-notary).  Followed bya signed document, with someone who can testify that the signature on the document is authentic (because that witness is familiar with the signor's signature). Probably followed by some other kind of document, like a typewritten /s/ document or e-mail.  Probably followed by a pure oral agreement (in most circumstances, oral agreements are binding, if the parties intended to bind each other.  there are circumstances, at least in the U.S. to this doctrine, however).\n\nI hope you get some response from someone in the U.K., because there certainly can be differences in the law (even with our common legal heritage), so don't take anything I say as definite.",1624
2,"Why am I nauseous? ; For some reason I get nauseous once in a while, and I have no idea why. When I get nauseous I also burp a lot, get moody and have very little energy. It comes and goes. Doctors tell me I am fine, but they do not know anything (they are good for treating a flu). Can this be allergies? What doctor should I go to see? ; Early gallbladder disease is a possibility, particularly if your symptoms occur after you eat fatty foods.  If so, you should ask your doctor to send you for an ultrasound to rule in or out gallbladder disease.  In the meantime, if it is the fatty foods which cause the symptoms, stop eating the fatty foods.",1625
2,"Are there any amphetamines, which are harmful  in Lipozene? ; Have read that this is a fiber substance, which causes a full feeling in the intestinal track, thus you eat less.\nBut are any traces of amphetamines included, which would suppress appetite and increase activity, leading to serious side effects, such as nervousness and insomnia? ; There are no amphetamines, however, watch out for this product; my reasons are detailed below:\n\n1) The maker of this product, Obesity Research Institute LLC, has a real credibility problem. They've been charged by the Federal Trade Commission for making false and unsubstantiated claims and forced to pay $1.5 million in customer redress. This is for the products Propolene and Fiberslim, both of which are based upon the ingredient glucomannan. This doesn't bode well for Lipozene. \n\nIf you'd like to review the Federal Trade Commission press release for this action, just go here: http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2005/06/fiberthin.htm\n\n2) Fiber is useful, but its effects are subtle and are best seen over the long term.

6,Why BSNL charges service tax on rent ? ; Does monthly rent come under the service tax ? We should pay the service tax on the telephone charges we are making(This is the service BSNL paying. Why BSNL adds up this to the monthly rent and charges 12.25% service tax on it ? Thus effectively the rent becomes Rs.202 instead of Rs.180. Also why there is monthly rent for mobile when the instrument does not belong to BSNL unlike in landline connection ? Why also there Cellone charges service tax on rent in addition to call charges ? ; Service Tax on monthly rent is due to the Central Govt. advise to BSNL.  You know that I am fined by ICICI Bank with Rs.750/- for failure to maintain the minimum balance in my S.B A/c.  It is a fine by bank to me.  On that fine amount Rs.750/- again they have charged 12.2% service tax. (750+92=842/-).  \n\nThere is no end to service tax.  It is a back door tax.  People are not opposing the service tax.,1636
0,"Where in the Bible? ; Where in the bible does it say that someone shouldn't listen to secular music? My friend recently said she was giving up listening to secular music not because she felt that the message was wrong but that she just loves music and listen's to it too much and memorizes the lyrics, she basically says she feels guilty for liking music...but why does she choose to single out secular...can you not memorize christians lyrics as well. I could completely understand if she felt that the music went against her religious beliefs but she listens to Tori Amos and Dave Matthews...last time I checked they weren't performing Ritual sacrafice on stage...I think she is being religiously trendy as i call it. ; HI Derek,\nGood question. Obviously I do not know what your friend's church background is. Although what she is doing is appropriate from a Biblical standpoint, she might be legalistic in her approach (Overly stiff, following a rule as though its the ONLY way to do something). But let's assume that she is a Christian that simply desires to walk with God in a close manner. There's a ""fancy"" word called sanctification. It means to be set apart. Both the Old Testament and the New are full of stories and commands that depict that God expects his people to NOT look like the non-believing people. So that alone could cause your friend to choose Christian music over secular. Have you listened to the words in secular music lately Derek? They've always talked about love, but they are now often filled with a lot of profanity, sex even violence. Christians are called to not purposely fill their minds with those things (Romans 12:1-2) because as a man thinks so he acts...(Proverbs 23:7) so if we fill our minds with negative thoughts, we tend to be very pessimistic. The same is true with any thoughts - garbage in - garbage out!\n\nWhen a person becomes a Christian they are set apart by Christ - He calls them to change, to leave what was behind and press ahead to what God has called them to do- He provides the power (Ephesians 5) but as a Christian we are under new ownership (2 Corinthians 5:17-21). If you are not a Christian, that may seem very odd, but it makes sense that if you have a new ""boss"" at work, you do things his way - especially if that boss is smart, loving and giving like God. Why wouldn't you want to follow him? \n\nAnyway, you asked, where in the Bible does it say....the problem in answering is: where does it not say that. I could quote passage after passage, but I think you see my point. \n\nFrankly, Christians SHOULD be involved as engineers, scientists, musicians, doctors and everything else. Christians are called to be salt and light to a world (Matthew %:13-14) which Jesus says is corrupted and is dying (He died to save people who recognize that and turn to Him). Perhaps your friend is overdoing it a bit - but perhaps this is her way of saying, enough is enough, and she's trying to run form her junky past and begin living more consistently for God. I hope you will be patient and supportive. \n\nHope that helps.\n\nMy best,\nProf Mark\nhttp://prof-mark.com",1637

There is an obvious pattern here: the number of people needed each generation to produce one person is doubled each generation. For the purposes of this question, lets assume that there are 4 generations each century. That would mean that every thousand years there are 40 generations, thus resulting in 80 generations in the year 0 (2000 years ago).Since every generation the number of people doubles, there must have been 2^80 people 2000 years ago.Inclusive of insane amounts of incest (grandfather-daughter, father-daughter, etc),this number is still too big.

For some it only takes a few weeks or a month. Talk with your gynecologist to decide what pill will be best for you. \n2.) Remember when starting a new pill side effects can last anywhere from a week to three months so give it a fair go. It is better to just stay on it straight through versus going on and off. Going on and off can seriously whack your body/cycle and emotions out because your body will be constantly having a change in the hormones. And your periods would be all over the place.\n3.) Every pill will affect different people differently. That's why I say check with your doctor. I DON'T recommend the shot(Depo Provera) because some of the more common side effects are constant spotting and weight gain. Also it can take months or even a year after you go off it to have a regular cycle back. You may want to try a low-dose pill because of previous emotional side effects.

3,"Can you explain the Anglo-Saxon poem called The Wife's Lament? ; I can't seem to find a summary online.  Best answer gets 10pts! ; ok summer here is the best i got:\n\nThis poem is (obviously) a lament, or some sorrow for something lost, also known as an elegy.  In this case, the poem is a woman's song.  She is lamenting the loss of her lover (it is possible that he is simply not there, or absent).  \nHowever, it appears as if ""her lord"" is the same lord that governs the people in this poem.  Therefore, for some reason they are isolating her from him.  Her lord himself tells her to take up a ""dwelling"" that he has apparently appointed for her.  \nOnce there, she meets a man and falls in love with him, claiming that ""death alone"" would separate them.\nFor the remainder of the poem, the woman is expressing her deep grief as she is in exile in what seems to be some type of cave or tunnell in the ground.\n\nhere is a paragraph by paragraph analysis:\n1.  \nHere she is introducing her lament as a sorrowful tale of her utmost woe; that never before has she experienced any distress as dire or excruciating as this.\n\n2.\nhere she explains that her lords family/ gentry sent him on a sea journey.  ""Dawn-cares"" can be interpreted as she either worries about him so much, she is losing sleep, or she wakes up in the morning, and her 1st thought is her husband.  [These compound words are famous in anglo-saxon poetry.]  She decides to go into exile, which was a custom of women to do who were w/o there husbands.  She may have disgraced him and is thencforth banishing herself.  It seems that she is turning to his people for advice, and they have their own plans as to where she should go.  The scheme and plot to send her away and put her in a position which will forever keep them apart. \n\n3.\nHer lord confirms the dwelling place she is to go to.  Where she went for exile, she knows few people.\n\n4.  \nShe falls in love with a man who is depressive and well taken care of.  He also seems to be in exile w/ a broken heart...he may even be suicidal.  They vow together, that, in their exile, they will have eachother.  But, he kills himself, destroying their pact.  she is back to where she stared in her sorrow.\n\n5.  \nFillied with longing, she is sent to live in a cave or some sort of underground hovel.  \n\n6. She describes her surroundings as dismal and ""briar-choked"".  She bemoans that fact that loves walk the earth and experience joy, while she is condemned to despair.  She explains that she can never gain composure because she used to be so full of hope, promise, and she was enthused for life.  Now that everything is taken from her, she is torn.  She takes a turn to curse her lord and wish upon him sorrow and grief, that he may become lost and wandering in his journeys.  She wished upon him a brooding heart and ""breast cares"" (broken heart). \n\nWell, I really hope this helps you!! Good luck with everything!  I will also email this to u so u get it.",1774

1,"what is meant by death ?how death occurs?what are all the changes takes place in the cellular level? ; i wan t to know about the biochemical changes occur in our body after death and of course about the parameters pH,and so on ; This is a more complex question than it seems. In order to fully define Death we would have to fully define Life, and that has not been done yet. Life can be described, and there is the Cell Theory of Life, but what 'life' is, no one can say yet.\nHowever, it is plain that everything living moves somehow, and that it reproduces somehow, and that whatever is living must use and excrete whatever substances it needs in order to keep on living. In most cases we are talking here about nutrition and respiration, respiration being the more critical. When respiration ceases either on a cellular level or throughout the entire organism, everything shuts down, because chemical reactions in the cells and between them can no longer take place. Some bacteria will go into a spore stage when this happens, and can thus survive extremes of temperatures and dehydration (like anthrax and TB). Generally in the absence of oxygen, cells lose their ph balance and become acidic, which upsets all chemical reactions in the cell. Conversely, anaerobic bacteria like botulism, when exposed to oxygen, go through a similar process of having all chemical reactions messed up.\nTherefore, although we cannot say what exactly 'death' is, we recognize it in animals by: an absence of respiration, an absence of pulse, an absence of reflexes (due to brain and nerve death), an absence of sensation, an absence of conciousness, and an inability to eat or reproduce. It is further noted by an absence of brain wave activity.\nIn plants death is noted by an inability to rehydrate, lack of response to stimuli, inability to reproduce or respire, and limpness.\nIn microbes, death is noted by an absence of cell division or reproduction, or by bursting of the cell walls.",1809

1,"Will the spin of galaxies ever stop? ; Do the laws of physics postulate that the spinning of galaxies/planets/moons will eventually slow to a stop or is it infinitely perpetual? (Bare with me. I have no physics education) ; carljoseph has the correct answer.  The galaxies have no reason to stop spinning any more than the planets have a reason to stop orbiting the sun.  (Eric p, I don't know why you think the law of perpetual motion does not apply to circular motion.)  There is no continuous force that *keeps* them in motion ... it's just momentum from the process that formed the  galaxies (or the solar systems), and there is no counter-force (like air resistance) slowing them down.  Now it's possible that there is infinitessimal resistance due to space dust, but there's nothing in the laws of physics that says that a rotating object (like a galaxy or a solar system) must eventually stop rotating.  So they will continue to turn indefinitely.\n\nNow, some of these stars will explode at some times in their lifespan, and may or may not leave behind the burned out shells (mostly iron, the most stable atomic nucleus there is) of dead stars and planets, but the galaxies will continue to spin as long as there are stars (or star remnants) in them.",1834
1,"phisics problem:a drop with primary radius r0 falls from height and gets moisture from air dm/dt=ks? ; drop gets moisture according to its surface   dm/ds=ks \ns is surface of drop.\nfind the acceleration of drop ?\nfind radiuse of drop according to time? ; In this following, I'll assume that the drop maintains a spherical shape.  Otherwise, the math will get horrendous, and one probably can't get an analytical solution.\n\nThe surface area of a sphere is given by:\n\nS = 4*pi*r^2\n\nThe mass of a sphere of density D is simply the volume times the density.  The volume of a sphere with radius r is given by:\n\nV = 4/3 * pi * r^3,\n\nso the mass is given by:\n\nM = 4/3 * pi * r^3 * D.\n\nWe know that the drop gains mass according to:\n\ndM/dt = k*S = k*4*pi*r^2\n\nSubstitute the expression for the mass as a function of radius into this differential equation:\n\n4/3*pi*D*d(r^3)/dt = k*4*pi*r^2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nd(r^3)/dt = 3*k*r^2/D\n\nlet u = r^3\n\nthen\n\ndu/dt = 3*k*u^(2/3)/D\n\nu^(-2/3) du = 3*k/D dt\n\nIntegrate this to obtain\n\n3(u^1/3 -u0^1/3) = 3*k*(t-t0)/D\n\nwhere u0 and t0 are the constants of integration, and in this problem, we can let t0 = 0.\n\nSubstituting back for u and simplifying:\n\nr - r0 = k*t/D\n\nr(t) = k*t/D + r0\n\nThis gives the radius as a function of time, which is the desired result.\n\nIn the absence of friction and neglecting the change in gravitational acceleration as a function of height, the drop would have a constant acceleration of g (9.807 m/s^2).  If we include air friction (and continue to assume a spherical raindrop) then the net acceleration is:\n\na = g - 0.5 * C * D * A * v^2/M\n\nwhere C is the drag coefficient (= 1/2 for a sphere), \nA is the cross sectional area\nM is the mass\nv is the velocity\nD is the density\n\nSubstituting expressions for the mass and area in terms of the radius, we get:\n\na = g - (0.5 * C * D * pi * r^2 * v^2)/(4/3 * pi * r^3 * D)\na = g - 3/8 * C * v^2/r\n\nif C = 0.5 (for a sphere)\na(t) = dv(t)/dt = g - (3*v(t)^2)/(16*r(t))\n\nFrom here, one would need to substitute the expression derived previously for r as a function of t, solve the differential equation to find v(t), then take the derivative of v(t) with respect to t to get a(t) in terms of t.  This is straightforward, but involves some tedious algebra that I'm not inclined to do at the moment!",1835

However, Muslim from the beginning had an agressive edge to it as it mixed with the local religions (why theres genies and stuff there, traditional Persian stuff got mixed in) and its this desire to convert that made it spread so far in the first place (from middle east all across north africa and to India in a remarkably short time). \nPeaceful? perhaps, expansionist? definitely, but then what religion doesnt want to expand?",1840

For those of you who don't know, all ten amendments in the Bill of Rights cannot be changed or eliminated...but if it could, would you want to get rid of the 2nd Amendment? ; No, I wouldnt.  Because criminals would still have guns, only the law abiding people would turn their guns in.  Then think about this ... if you were a criminal would you prefer your victims to be armed or unarmed?  Unarmed of course, but with the second amendment criminals know there's a good chance that their victims can shoot back at them.\n\nAustralia enacted strict gun control measures in the '90s and afterward they saw their crime soar.  A recent study by Hollands Leiden University on crime rates in industrialized nations found that Australia is now the most dangerous nation in the industrialized world.

Always take precautions in your communications with others. Never give out your home phone number and if you meet in person, provide your own transportation to a public place. Once you meet in person, you'll start to learn more about the person you've only met online. Also, trust your gut instincts.\n\nNow to answer your other question... apparently it is pretty successful. A study of eHarmony showed that in a one year period, 33,000 of their members married. That's an average of 90 a day!!! I'd estimate that when you combine all the dating services, there are over 100,000 marriages a year.

1,"is oxygen flammable? ; will oxygen burn by itself without a fuel source? ; The answer is resoundingly NO.   Oxygen is NOT a fuel.  Flames, fire and all related chemical reactions are a result of a FUEL being OXIDIZED, or being combined with oxygen. The application of oxygen to a burning fuel will cause the fire to burn much more vigorously, as well as hotter.  \n\nOxygen, by itself, WILL NOT BURN.  If it did, our atmosphere (which is 20.9% oxygen) would have burned up a long time ago.\n\nOxygen is mixed with a number of different fuel sources to get a faster, hotter burn.  Acetylene, used in metal cutting torches, is mixed with oxygen to get a super hot flame that will quickly cut through metal.\n\nNASA uses oxygen to burn hydrogen fuel, not only to get a fast burn required in a rocket engine, but also because surrounding oxygen in the atmosphere becomes much more scarce as you leave the atmosphere for space.",1911

Mail. The rollout will continue with the other 70% in the 2nd phase on May, until all Members that do not have parental controls enabled have the option to use the new version of Yahoo! Mail.\n\nYou dont need any invites to be able to use the new Yahoo Beta email. You just need to at least meet the system requirements:\n\n*Browsers\nIE 5.5 and higher (for Windows) \nFirefox 1.0 or higher (for Mac and Windows) \nMozilla Suite 1.7 or higher (for Mac and Windows) \nNetscape 7.2 (For Windows) \nSBC Yahoo!

But if you decide to switch back to Beta again, then you simply go to the Options tab (on the upper right corner), there would be a purple button there to Try Yahoo Beta again.

The fossils are in chronological order: single-celled, multi-celled, soft-bodied, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, apes ...\n\nIf creationism did happen, wouldn't the fossils appear simultaneously? Side by side?\n\nIf the Great Flood did happen, shouldn't the fish be on the top layer instead of near the bottom? Since fish would've survived in the ocean during the Great Flood ...?\n\nNo, ""devil created fossils"" or ""it was God's magic"" answers. Logical answers only please. ; You are right.\n\nCenturion: I hope that you only are asking this question sarcastically, in order to give an example of the silly questions that creationists ask, so nobody has to explain that obviously species take separate evolutionary paths, based on their environment, so that the same species in different environments will eventually evolve into different species.\n\nUnknown: What do you mean by a fossil of a creature turning into something else?  That doesn't really make much sense, seeing how all creatures are in the process of turning into ""something else"" - we just don't know what the future of evolution holds.  Haven't you heard about the recent discovery of the fossil of the ""fish"" which helps to provide evidence of the transition of animals from water to land?  I don't really know what you mean by saying that there are no ""missing links"" - there are thousands of them!  I just ahve the feeling that no number of missing links would be sufficient.  Between any two species it will always be possible ask for a ""linking"" fossil, and since there cannot be an infinite number of fossils, it will always be theoretically possible to say that no missing links have been found.\n\nmamcrackin: http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12200044CLXE\nsee my comment above that no number of misssing links will ever be able to ""prove"" evolution.  If half-man/half-animal were found (and they have been, just look at all the fossils of the earlier human species) creationists would just ask for 3/4 man, 1/4 animal fossils, and then 7/8 man, 1/8 animal, and so on.  \n\nindiebaptist: Her point is that while there would be fish fossils evenly dispersed throughout the layers of earth, non-aquatic animals would be clumped in one layer - the layer during which the flood occurred.  This is not what we find when looking at the fossils in the layers of earth.  The great flood was also gods way of killing a lot of animals who had done nothing to deserve that punishment. by the way, hovind's PhD (from a non accredited school) is in christian education, not biology or any other science. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind  \nI really have to wonder where you are getting your facts from.  Darwin wasn't a lawyer, and even if he was, you are citing the work of someone trained in christian education, not science in order to support your belief.  How is that any better?  In any case, Darwin was formally trained to be a clergyman, but studied a lot of the natural sciences on the side. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin\nRegardless of darwin's training, his theories must stand on their own merit, as his has done, and not on the credentials of their creator.",2003

He has played his whole career with Scott Niedermayer(possible Hall-of-Famer), and the ever-intimidating Scott Stevens, in NJ, two of the best defensemen of their day, and look how his numbers have fallen since they left this year. Plus you could make a good argument for Niedermayer as the MVP some of those years, or this one in ANA. \n\nOver the span of their careers, Goals Against Average has been equal, but Hasek has posted a far better save%, showing he has more versatility playing for many teams with many different players. \n\nLook, they're two of the best goalies who have proven their greatness with championships, and staistical records as well.

When you give your heart to Jesus, you begin a personal relationship with him.\n\nIt's like if the person of your dreams asks you out.  Now you have a boyfriend (or girlfriend).  So then what do you do? Do you just call it a day? Of course not. You spend time with the person, get to know them. You also make mistakes, get into fights, and forgive one another.  All the while the relationship grows, and so does the love.  \n\nIt is the same with Jesus.  You can't just call it a day once you're saved. OK getting saved will keep you from going to hell, so you don't have to worry about that anymore.  If you've repented and accepted His forgiveness, then you are forgiven.  But there is so much more to learn.  You can spend the rest of your life getting to know Jesus personally. The more you seek Him the more you will find Him and the more prepared you will feel. You do this by spending time with him in prayer (both speaking and listening to Him)and spending time in the word (read the bible).  Also if you don't already, find a good church to go to and good Christain friends to help you in your walk with Him.  It really is an awesome journey, but it's up to you to take the steps.\n\nBest of luck and many blessings. :)",2017

9,"How does a ban on homosexual marriage ""defend"" heterosexual marriage? ; During the recent ""debate"" in Congress any number of Republicans stated that they were ""defending"" marriage.  I don't see how preventing homosexuals from having the same rights given heterosexuals ""defends"" or ""protects"" marriage.  Are current rights and obligations of married people towards each other going to change if gays get married?  Are the current benefits married couples received going to be reduced if gays get married?\n\nOne justification given is that marriage is the best way of raising children and that ""procreation"" needs to be protected.  Both of these seem to be non-sequiters.   If marriage is best for children, then it should be expanded so that the hundreds of thousands of children being raised by their gay or lesbian parents can have a two-parent household.   ""Procreation"" seem to be way off the mark, first no state has ever limited marriage to persons who intended to or even were capable of procreation.  Its the one procreating without marriage that are the problem. ; Be careful. If you keep making sense, they'll start listening to your phone calls and reading your e-mail. Oops...too late.\n\nFrankly, if they really wanted to ""defend marriage"", they should repeal all divorce laws and make adultery a felony.

Now I have NO breasts just lose skin that hangs on my chest. It is very upsetting I try to live with it but it's hard. You feel as if you have lost something as a woman matter a fact you don't feel very womanly. Is there anyone out there that can HELP ME !! ; Weight loss surgery-like gastric bypass /lap band surgery / stomach stapling and gastrectomy have become very common and very safe now. My cousin got her Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in India. She has lost more than 65 lbs in 5 months and is very happy with the results. The price for obesity surgery is very less in India. My cousin just paid 25% of the cost she was quoted in America. She got her surgery from a company called Forerunners Healthcare.\n\nForerunners Healthcare is very famous in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and magazines. I have read a lot of their patient stories also. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low cost, as bariatric surgery and weight loss surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that your Obesity surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\nHope this helps.",2081

I have read that the American Native people who smoke only dried tobacco leaves have a very low incidence of lung cancer.\nOf course today we also have all the wonderful polution in the air from chemical plants and car exhaust plus the pollution of the water by chemical plants who produce chemical fertilizers for golf courses and farms and people's lawns.

Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

I think that there is no black whole at the center of galaxies, I believe that the gravitational pull off all the stars at the center are pulling as well as pushing away. So stars are actually either being aborbed into bigger stars >> that's why its brighter toward the center >> or the more stars that are being pulled in toward the center of the galaxy are dancing around each other making the center of the galaxy spin faster >> from our perspective we cannot tell what's really going on at the center of the galaxy.\n\nWhat do you think is really happening? ; Most people *don't* believe galaxies are black holes.  A black hole is a region of space from which nothing can escape, even light.  \n\nSince you can't see a black hole (that light that isn't escaping), one has to rely on indirect evidence.  \n\n If you've found a large mass concentrated in a small volume, and if the mass is dark, then it's a good guess that there's a black hole there.  \n\nIt'll be quite some time before we can get ""hard evidence"" of a black hole.

6,"27 Years old. Am I too late to invest? ; I have aboy $3,000 in the Thrift Savings Plan (a government type IRA), and that's about it. I have bought and sold some stocks, been pretty good at it so far, but i need security. I akm about $6,000 in total debt, do not own a home and have a good ratio on my earning to spending. My checking account has about $2,000.00 that I don't need to pay bills. I am in the navy and I reitre in 13 years, and I want to be able to retire at that time. I will have the military pension, but we all know that's not enough. I just opened an ING bank account last week to start putting some cash there (4.5%), but I need something good, and that will be ready for me in 13 years. Any help is appreciated. ; No, you are not too old.  The TSP is more like a 401k.  If you want to retire in 13 years, you have a lot of work to do... I mean a LOT.  What GS are you?  Are you making enought money to save?  With the TSP, you should be contributing atleast 3%, because they will match with 100%, then 50% above 3%.  You might want to look into talking with a financial advisor.  If you dont' want to pay fees to an advisor, you should start learning about different types of investments (if you don't know already).  Try www.investopedia.com to learn and www.sharebuilder.com to actually invest.  I recommend ETFs and Index funds.  Over the long term, they will always have gains.  4.5% is a good rate for a savings account but watch out for ""catches"" also, it may just be an introductory rate.  \n\nIdeally, if you retire at 40 and live another 40 years, can obtain a 7% rate of return, and need $40,000 a year for the 40 years in retirement, you need to have a little more than $500,000 in savings by the time you are 40 years old.\n\nYou can reach this $500,000 if you save about $27,000 a year for the next 13 years, given a 7% rate of return.  \n\nDepending on your salary, this may be obtainable but you have a lot of work to do since you have basically no savings.  Also, I used 7% because thats the average rate of return in the stock market but depending on your investments, it may be more or less.  I would take full advantage of your TSP because all that matching the gov't does will really pay off.  Also, it may be tough, but buy very few ""wants"" and try to stick to spending money on ""needs.""  People usually think it is impossible, but it really isn't.  Also, I'm sure you'll want a home at some point and you have to take that into consideration as well.  Good luck.",2154

Tyler has a very similar riding style, when compared with Ivan Basso.\n\nRemember all of the past TDFs where Lance Armstrong and Hamilton where always side by side on the mountain. stages? I don't know if Ivan would be able to endure the pain that Tyler did in the 2003 TDF, where at the end of stage 1, he was involved in a 35 rider accident where he broke his collar-bone in two places.

Ivan never beat Lance! That mountain stage win was a courtesy win given as a gift to Basso from Armstrong. Lance has a lot of respect for Basso and considered him to be a rider that could one day take his place. Watch the tour footage and you'll see Lance wave Basso on before reaching the finish. Lance gave up several yellow jerseys to other riders that he felt deserved it, as long as he had the overall lead, that was all that matterd to Lance.\n\nResponse to Doping Accusations by the (angry) Europeans:\n\nI myself, have never touched a drug in my life, yet years ago I tested positive twice, by the sport I was involved in. I retested again and was found innocent on both accounts.\n\nThan again when I was 17, I failed a polygraph that I was completely truthful on.

In several states, sodomy is illegal. Drug use is illegal. Minors buying tobacco is illegal. Are these issues morally wrong? A good debate with arguments from each side could be made.\n\nOn to Constitutional amendments. The Constitution creates and protects our beliefs as a country. Amendment 13 bans slavery. Amendment 14 banned ex-Conferates from holding national office. Article 18 banned alcohol in the US and Article 21 repealed it. All of these amendments (and many more) deal with moral issues that we, as a society, have decided are either right or wrong.\n\nConstitutional amendment are designed to deal with more specific issues rather than broad issues, and the specific areas you discuss are prime areas for a Constitutional amendment. That is why is it so important that the country has intelligent discourse from citizens involved in the political process.

Like the film's hero, Smith is afflicted with Morquio Syndrome, a rare enzyme disorder that affects the circulatory, muscular and skeletal systems. The Smiths were concerned about exploitation but after reading the novel on which the film was based agreed to allow their son to audition. Although he eventually lost on that role (the film was ""The Mighty"" and Kieran Culkin landed the part), Smith was recommended for another role in a film based on a novel. This time, his audition tape won over the director and the novice was hired to essay the title role of ""Simon Birch"" (1998), suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"". Because of his illness, Smith is just over three feet tall, having undergone several operations including a spinal fusion and two bilateral osteotomies, he was the perfect choice to play Simon, touted as having been so small when he was born his mother didn't even notice the delivery. The novice actor proved a natural before the cameras and impressing some reviewers who found the film itself treacly and sentimental. \n•Born: \nin Illinois\n•Job Titles: \nActor\nFamily\n•Brother: Brian Smith. younger \n•Father: Steve Smith. runs consulting firm in the Chicago area \n•Mother: Gayle Smith. \nMilestones\n•1998 Film acting debut in title role of ""Simon Birch"" \n•Auditioned for the lead role in ""The Mighty""; part went to Kieran Culkin \n•Raised in Elmhurst, Illinois",2248

1,"Normal subgroups of GL(n, R)? ; In particular, does GL(n, R) have a compact  normal subgroup? Which? If not, what are normal subgroups in GL(n, R)? ; Every group has a compact normal subgroup, namely the identity.  \nAs noted, the scalar matrices form the center of your group G.  Therefore the two-element subgroup {plus/minus I} is also normal in G.\n\nAs noted, the group SL_n is normal in G.  Therefore if H is also normal in G, its intersection H' with SL_n is normal in SL_n.  It is known that if H' is a normal subgroup of SL_n, then H' is contained in the scalar matrices, which are trivial if n is odd and {plus/minus I} if n is even.\n\nIf H is not equal to H' it must contain a matrix of determinant not equal to 1.  If this determinant is not plus/minus 1, then H is not compact.  Let us note that the set of matrices with determinant plus/minus 1 is a normal subgroup of G containing SL_n.\nFor that matter, also note that the set of matrices with positive determinant is normal in G.\n\nThis discussion should enable you to classify the normal subgroups of GL_n.  If you mean *Lie* subgroups we are done.  \nIn particular, there are exactly two compact ones, already noted.",2294

1,"Theory of relativity  and the twin paradox: is the aging biological? ; The twin paradox is a very well-known example to present the theory of relativity. One of twins jumps into a space ship and the other one stays on Earth. Each of the twins moves in relation to each other. The traveler-twin, once back on Earth, is younger than the twin who stayed. \n\nWhat I don't understand is what this aging really means. I DO understand that the watches each of them is wearing show a difference in time. But does the traveler really change BIOLOGICALLY? Does he ""look younger"" than the other twin? In practice, would the traveler-twin get gray hair later than the other twin? Or does aging in this context mean something else? So my question, shortly put, is: does aging in the context of theory of relativity mean 1)just impression that time is going faster on Earth than in space  2)real changes in biology, real physical aging? The twin who returns back from the space ship journey: does he look exactly as old as the other twin or has he really remained younger? ; Yes.  It means that for the twin that stayed on Earth, the time really passed for him, and for the twin who traveled, less time passed.\nThe older twin doesnt just ""look"" older, he really is older.

Eat until you are stuffed with all the fresh, raw, or canned vegetables.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans, peas, and corn. Eat along with the soup.  At dinner time on this day, reward yourself with a big baked potato and butter.  Do not eat any fruits.\n\nDAY THREE:  Eat all the soup, fruits, and vegetables you want.  Do not have a baked potato.  If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will have lost 5 to 7 pounds.\n\nDAY FOUR:  Bananas and skim milk. Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many glasses of water as you can on this day along with the soup.  Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on this particular day your body will need the potassium and \nthe carbohydrates, proteins and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.\n\nDAY FIVE:  Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 to 20 ounces of beef and a can of tomatoes or as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water\nthis day to wash away the acid in your body.  Eat the soup at least once this day.\n\nDAY SIX:  Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of the beef and vegetables this day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with the green leafy vegetables, but no baked potato.  be sure and eat the soup.\n\nDAY SEVEN:  Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables. Again, stuff yourself.  Be sure to have the soup at least once today.\n\nAt the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on the above diet, you will have lost 10 to 17 pounds.  If  you have lost more than 17 pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming again from day one.\n \nThis seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being as never before.\n\nAfter only seven days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least 10 and possibly 17 pounds, having an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan as long as you wish and feel the difference.\n\nThis diet is fast, fat-burning, and the secret is that you will burn more calories than you take in. It will flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lend itself to drinking any alcoholic beveragesat any time because of the removal of fat build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any intake of alcohol.\n\nBecause everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when you began, if you did not cheat.  After\nbeing on this diet for several ",2357

I would recommend that approach for now.  You don't have much time left.  When I took the ACT it was written form--I'm not sure it's changed or not to computer form.

SAT scores are not the only thing that colleges look at, and plus, your SAT score doesn't judge the content of your character. It's more important to be a god person than to be a high test scorer.

Only Web.\nThank you. ; 250 Bettina was discovered by Johann Palisa on September 3, 1885 in Vienna. It was named in honour of Baroness Bettina von Rothschild, the wife of the prominent Viennese banker Albert Salomon von Rothschild who had bought the nameing rights for £50\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild (October 29, 1844 - February 11, 1911) was a banker in Austria-Hungary and a member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria.\n\nBorn in Vienna, he was the youngest child of Anselm von Rothschild (1803-1874) and Charlotte von Rothschild (1807-1859). Known in the family as ""Salbert,"" he was educated in Vienna and Brünn\n\nOn his father's death in 1874, brothers Nathaniel and Ferdinand inherited most of the family's real estate and art collection. However, the family business went to Albert including the S M von Rothschild bank, the single largest shareholding in the Creditanstalt, and the shares in the Northern Railway. After two generations in Austria, communications between his family and the Rothschilds in England had diminished considerably but Albert wisely reinstated the regular exchange of vital information on current economic matters and politics in their respective countries.\n\nIn 1876, Albert von Rothschild married Baroness Bettina Caroline de Rothschild (1858-1892) of Paris, France, daughter of Alphonse James de Rothschild. They had the following children:\n\nGeorg Anselm Alphonse (March 22, 1877 - January 10, 1934), never married, he died in a private mental hospital and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \nAlfons Maier (1878-1942) \nCharlotte Esther (1879-1885) \nLudwig (Louis) Nathaniel (1882-1955) \nEugène Daniel (1884-1976) \nValentine Noémi (1886-1969) \nOskar Ruben (1888-1909), never married, at age 21 he committed suicide and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \n\nAlbert von Rothschild owed several large properties including the Palais Albert Rothschild at Prinz-Eugen-Straße 20-22, in the IV. district Wieden district of Vienna designed by the French architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur and built between 1876 and 1882.\n\nIn December of 1887 Albert and his wife were given the right to be presented at Court, the first time such a privilege had been granted in Austria to persons of the Jewish faith. Albert continued the family's involvement in the arts and with philanthropic projects. An avid chess player, he sponsored tournaments and in 1872 became president and patron of the Vienna chess society and took a special interest in institutions that provided assistance to Jewish artists and musicians. Following his wife's passing in 1892 at the young age of thirty-four, in her memory Albert von Rothschild built the Bettina Frauenspital (Bettina Hospital for Women) and a Bettina Rothschild begonia was named for her. A benefactor of the Vienna Observatory, the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named the large Main belt asteroid he discovered in 1885 the 250 Bettina in her honor.\n\nAlbert was awarded the Iron Cross of Merit in 1893 for his role in Austro-Hungarian monetary reform.\n\nWhen his unmarried and childless brother Nathaniel died in 1905, Albert inherited his Palais Rothschild at 14-16 Theresianumgasse in Vienna along with its large collection of art.\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild died in Vienna in 1911 and was interred next to his wife and their six-year-old daughter Charlotte in the city's Zentralfriedhof. In recognition of Albert von Rothschild's years of financial support, the 719 Albert Amor asteroid was named in his memory by astronomer Johann Palisa.",2410

The United States continues to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and human rights safeguards in Peru and the integration of Peru into the world economy. \nThe United States and Peru cooperate on efforts to interdict the flow of narcotics, particularly cocaine, to the United States.

U.S. exports to Peru were valued at $3.5 billion in 2005, accounting for 30.3% of Peru's imports.

5,"what is rong with my fantasy baseball team? ; my team is doing terrible, please help me with trades ,adds/drops.\n\nMy team:c,R martin,c,J varitek,1b,B broussard,2b,J vidro,3b,B hall,\nss,E renteria,of,C crawford,of,C crisp,of,R johnson,of,A rios,\nu,A ramirez.Pitchers:T glavine,B howry,R lopez,D lowe,B penny,\nK rogers,B wagner,D willis.BENCH:c,D ross,3b,M ensberg. ; OK, follow me here because this is gonna take a while, but in the end I promise it will help your team a bunch if you give it a few weeks to take shape.\n\n1 catcher is all you need...you need to drop 2 and pickup a first baseman who plays EVERY DAY, I personally would keep Varitek or Ross.  Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

He is still in AIT and will be finished with that on the 14 of Dec. and is to report to Fort Campbell on the 14 of Jan. Also what is the difference between pCS orders and TDY orders. THANKS for your HELP!!! ; This is something you'll have to learn to get used to.  Sorry, but that's Army life.\n\nTDY is Temporary Duty.  Unless it's a certain amount of time or specified on his orders, you won't be going with him on these assignments.  Usually, TDY is some sort of school, training or ""war games"".\n\nPCS is Permanent Change of Station.  This is an official government move.  It's usually from one post to another.  If he's in AIT, he still hasn't made a PCS move yet.  PCS is a change in duty.\n\nKorea is NOT a deployment.  That's considered an unaccompanied tour.  They last a year to 18 months.  There's several places he could get sent for an unaccompanied tour.  In most cases, you won't go with him, thus the unaccompanied.  That's a PCS for him though.  He can also go to Japan, Germany, Italy or other locations overseas that you will be able to move with him as a PCS.  Places like Germany are a 3 year assignment.\n\nThere's several locations he can deploy to such as Bosnia or Iraq.  Deployments will last a year to 18 months as well.  Those, you won't be allowed to travel with him at all.  He can also deploy from and overseas location as well.\n\nHope this helps.  Be prepared for time apart.  Stay strong and independant, but love and trust him with all you have.  You'll be able to do fine.  The Army is a rough life, but it's a good life.  It'll definitely be what you make of it.\n\nGood luck!!",2429
0,"Info on Jehovah's witnesses? ; I need help on this report i'm doing. I need to find the good versus evil in the jehovah witness religion. for example christians have God as being good and satan as being evil. What do the Jehovah witness religion believe is good and evil. ; I think you will find that Jehovah Witnesses would have a view almost exactly like that of Christians. But they are not Christians, and they are identified as a cult because they deny that Jesus is Jehovah incarnate. They make Him out to be a created angel. Since they deny that God is Father, Son and Holy Spirit, they divorce themselves from historic, biblical Christianity. But they would agree that God is good and Satan is evil, that doesn't change. \n\nSomething to be aware of though, Satan is not an equal, negative version of God. Satan was created by God. God made him, and God will judge him. Satan is evil on a short leash. \n\nBut if you want to find out about Jehovah's Witnesses, check out some of the sites that have to deal with their errors on a daily basis:\n\nhttp://www.watchman.org/jwtools.htm\n\nor\n\nhttp://www.macgregorministries.org/jehovahs_witnesses/jehovah_witness_index.html",2433

What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice. I say WAKE UP, take responsibility for your actions, and GET LEGAL or leave.",2551

2,"Can anyone tell me about dental implants? ; How much do they cost, how are they permanently affixed, do they hurt when they are inserted, any other details I should know about?  I might get one of them. ; Dental implants vary tremendously in cost depending upon how many you will need.  Some of the answers here are wrong - very wrong.  A dental implant is better for your jaw bone and your own dental health because once the implant is properly seated in the bone it will stimulate your bone to grow just as your normal teeth stimulate the bone to grow.  \n\nI would guess you have seen little old men and or ladies who have almost now lower jaw and no teeth.  The jaw actual stopped growing new bone tissue because of the lack of stimulation for having teeth anchored to the jaw bone. \n\nHere is how they should work. You should have  a CAT scan done of your upper and lower jaw.  Depending upon where the implant is to be placed.  The dentist may want to make a surgical guide that will allow him to drill at the exact angle that is needed to the base of the implant is screwed into the correct type of bone.  This is critical because there are different  types of bone density in your jaw and you want your implant seated in the bone with the greatest density.  Once the implant is placed in your jaw bone he may or may not depending upon the opinion of the dentist  attache the final prosthetic onto the implant.  The prosthetic is what looks like a normal tooth.  Bingo - you are done. \n\nSummary Cost is variable, they do not hurt when inserted.  Dental implants are the best way to go for long lasting dental health",2604

If you can't do them all at first or if it is too easy then adjust as necessary for you.\n\nPUSH UPS  5 - 10 sets, of 10 - 15 reps each.  ( between each set vary how far apart your arms are.  regular, wide armed, and close hand )\nThis will help you hit all the major muscle groups there in your chest, arms, and shoulders.  \n\nPUSH UP PYRAMID.   Start with 15 reps,  take a break for a few seconds do 14, take a break for a few seconds and do 13.  Continue until you get to 0.  If you feel up to it then start at 1 and go back up the to 15.\n\nPUSH UPS FOR SPEED.  Do as many good push ups as you can do in 2 minutes.  Multiply this number by 2,  take a break for about 5 minutes and do the number you came up with at your own pace. No matter how long it takes.  Do this for a few weeks then time yourself again.  You will notice an improvement in how many you can do in 2 minutes.  Great if your in the Army like I am  for improving your Physical Fitness score.  \n\nFor your abdominals.  I suggest doing the following in addition to situps.  abdominal crunches,  oblique crunches, and flutter kicks.\n( do a search for these excersise to learn how to do them)\n\nAlso you should take up an activity like jogging or running.  This should be done on alternating days about 3 times a week.  \n\n\nYou can always add lots more and vary your work out in anyway you want.",2608

1,"Will we ever be able to go F.T.L.? ; i know there are a lot of doubts about this because the energy required would be close to infinite, and opening up a wormhole would also be next to impossible, even in the next 200 years of scientific advancement.  But, are there any scientific optimist out there who truly believes that we'll be able to achieve FTL in the next century or so, and why?  Give some minor facts to back up your claim. ; There is a big difference between predictions that the speed of sound could not be broken and that the speed of light cannot. It was always known that *some* things can go faster than sound. Bullets for example. The question was whether we would have the technology to get people to that speed.\n\nThe speed of light is very different since we haven't seen *anything* go faster than light in a vacuum. Nothing. Ever. Furthermore, the predictions of special relativity have been verified in particle accelerators when the particles are going to within a hundred thousandth of the speed of light.\n\nAs an example, at Fermilab protons are accelerated to energies of 2TeV. This is over 2000 times the rest mass of those protons. To accelerate something the mass of a *gram* to an equivalent speed would take about the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded. This amount of energy would be needed for each gram to get to that speed, so multiply it by 75000 for a medium sized human. And that doesn't count the spaceship they would have to travel in!\n\nNow, this is how much energy is needed to get to speed we *know* about. To go faster would require even more. Unfortunately, we have never seen a wormhole of any type. But the predictions are that the energy requirements would be even more prohibitive than what I just described.",2622

5,"What lures should I use in muddy water? ; I need answers now! I am leaving in 30 min to fish in a lake with muddy water due to 9 days of off and on rain.  What would be some more successful lures to catch some bass? ; When visibility is greatly reduced, choose big lures since they are easier for bass to see and catch. Bass seem reluctant to move far from a holding spot, so you want their first swipe at the lure to hook them. When the going gets muddy try: 1. Spinnerbaits – A large spinnerbait is highly visible and produces vibrations fish can sense with their lateral line. For maximum flash and vibration, use a 3/8 to 9/16 ounce black spinnerbait with a single Tennessee blade. If the current is slack, you may want to drop to a ¼ ounce model. You can also tip your spinnerbait with a trailer such as a big pork frog to add buoyancy so you can fish it slower. 2. Crankbaits – A big crankbait with a diving lip is deadly in muddy water, even in very shallow water. Use a slow retrieve to give the bass ample opportunity to find the lure. 3. Jigs – Use a big rubber-legged jig and large trailer to probe shallow cover. Black is a good primary color, but try a hot secondary color on the jig skirt or trailer, such as chartreuse or orange. In muddy water, you can approach bass closely, so try flippin a jig into cover in quiet pockets. 4. Plastic Lizards – Rig them Texas-style on a 3/16 ounce slip sinker. They work better than plastic worms because they have more bulk, therefore easier for bass to find. A lizard with a twister tail provides added vibration. Try black or black and chartreuse.\n\nIf spinnerbaits and crankbaits aren’t producing bass, slow your retrieve. If you still aren’t catching fish, change the lure style or size. Even lures of the same kind often produce different vibrations. A change in style and size changes the pattern of vibration, which can change the response of bass.",2626

1,"What is the easiest way to make an electromagnet? ; I am trying to build an electromagnet that can hold 200 to 500 lbs. ; Well, the easiest way is to get some wire, wrap it around a iron/steel rod, and apply a current to the wire.\n\nTo get an electromagnet to have a lifting capacity that you specified, it will require a little more engineering work.  Trying to stay in the most basic terms, the power of your magnet will depend on how much current you put through the wire, how many turns you have around the iron rod, and something called the magnetic permeability of the iron rod.  Now there's some trade-offs with all of these factors.  More turns increases the magnet flux (strength), but requires more wire and increases the resistance.  More resistance means that you will need more current to counteract this problem.  Treating your electromagnet strictly as a resistor (which it is not), by following Ohm's law, you increase the current by increasing the voltage.   Too much current and you may end up melting your wire.   You want to keep the wire as small as possible so that you can get the turns as close as possible to your iron rod, but smaller wire has a higher resistance and lower current carrying capability.\n\nIt's a matter of balancing a lot of equations to get the best combination.  Your best bet is a little trial and error.",2628

He has a few co-morbidites that will qualifiy him for surgery (blood pressure, BMI,  inactive thyroid, etc.). Our insurance states that it MAY pay for the surgery, but only after a year of medically supervised weight loss, ($300.00 a month). We, of course, cannot afford that, including the fact that they may deny it after you are out all that money.  My question is, does anyone know any safe alternatives to this? My husband broke his leg three years ago and has trouble walking any extended length and due to the pressure of his weight on his leg , it causes extreme pain. It is also hard for him to diet and loose any measurable amount of weight due to an inactive thyroid. He also has a congenital heart defect of disarythmia (spelling?). Does anyone have any ideas? Please, only serious replies, no jokes...... ; Well, he can start out by changing the way he eats.  Help him out, both of you make it a point to eat healthy.  He will start to lose weight from a better diet.  As far as exercise, he should just walk as far as he can, a few times a day.  He will gradually be able to go for longer and longer.  He should shoot for 30 minutes of activities a day, even if he can only do it 5 minutes at a time.  Also consider getting a stationary bicycle, once again, he can do it for very short periods of times and slowly add on more time and intensity.  It won't happen over-night, but I bet within a couple of weeks he will be feeling better and will have lost a few  pounds.",2669

(a) is no good because it fails to account for the continuing generation of heat, as, for example, by the earth.  (b) is no good because they were all about the same temperature when they formed.  As the protoplanets grew larger, their interiors began to heat up.  (c) is no good because what matters more is density, and there's no reason to believe there are significant differences in the density of radioactive elements.  (d) is just plain false: Earth is farther from the sun than Mercury.\n\nThat leaves (e).  Surface area of a sphere is 4pr^2, where p is pi, and volume is (4/3) pr^3, so the ratio of surface area to volume varies as 1/r ... it varies inversely with radius, so the ratio for smaller planets is greater than that for larger ones.\n\nThe key connection, though, is internal <pressure>, which is a direct function of r.  Larger planets have more pressure at their centers, and that means more heat.  In fact, if the ""planet"" were big enough, it would become a star.\n\nConclusion:  Big means hot.",2680

6,"Financial institution or not?  When to dump? ; I've been managing my money for quite some time and have done very well.  I realized that I may not be making wise choices with mutual funds and gave $80K to Fidelity to manage while I manage the rest of my accounts with Fidelity.  This was 4 months ago.  My rollover has since lost 10k.  Is it time to dump or is this the stock market?  None of my other investments have lost this much.  This is 10 grand in 4 months...   I'm ready to call them and say ""we're done, I'll do it"" but I'm not sure if they've changed my funds to give me a better turnover whereas I've left my money in my other funds for years.  Am I missing something? ; With respect to the market in general, there's been a good-sized pullback from May to the current period.  Those stocks which have suffered most are the ones which have had the largest amount of growth (precious metals, emerging markets, etc.).  Many funds not only lost all of their gains Jan-Apr, but many actually dipped into negative YTD territory.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: is this money you have in Fidelity on a permanent downward trend or an overdue correction?  Are your losses due to the possibility that your investments at Fidelity were focused on the highest growth (and therefore most volatile and overdue for correction) funds?  What are the long-term performance records of the funds you've chosen (4 months is a drop in the bucket of time)?\n\nBasically, you can't just look at gains and losses.  You have to look specifically at the funds you've chosen, and balance them against your personal risk tolerance.  It's very likely that with the right (or wrong) combination of funds, you could have lost as much with T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Bridgeway or any number of fund families.  If you don't believe me, look at their Websites and check the fund performances.  Red ink all over the place.\n\nDon't dump funds just because they're going down or buy them just because they're going up.  How do you know you're not buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  You'll inevitably wind up buying high and selling low.  Understand why you're buying into a fund and if the circumstances that made you buy them still make sense, stick with them.  If circumstances have changed, that's the time to re-evaluate and think about selling.  Also think about selling if the assumptions you made originally were wrong.",2688

6,"2 dollars bills? ; how come the u.s. is not making any more 2 dollars note??? ; In spite of its relatively low value, the two-dollar bill is one of the most rarely seen denominations of U.S. currency. This is partly due to the low production of the note; approximately 1% of all notes produced today are $2 bills. Two-dollar bills, unlike other denominations, are not frequently reissued in a new series. This is because bills are printed according to demand. When the Federal Reserve Banking System runs low on its current supply of $2 bills, it will submit an order to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which will then print more. Demand for $2 bills is low enough that one printing can last for many years. There is still a large supply of series 1976 bills that have not been circulated.\n\nIt is still a common perception that the $2 bill is rare, and when the general public encounters them, the bills are frequently hoarded and not circulated. According to the Treasury, they ""receive many letters asking why the $2 bill is no longer in circulation."" [1]. In response, the Treasury states: ""The $2 bill remains one of our circulating currency denominations. According to BEP statistics, 590,720,000 Series 1976 $2 bills were printed and as of February 28, 1999, there was $1,166,091,458 worth of $2 bills in circulation worldwide.""",2693

While it is on, the tungsten in the filament is evaporating from the heat until finally the filament gets so thin that it breaks and the bulb is useless.\n\nA halogen bulb includes a halogen gas in it. While it is on, the tungsten in the filament is evaporating from the very high heat that these bulbs are operating at. However tungsten vapor evaporating from the filament combines with the halogen gas so that the filament is rebuilt when the tungsten lands on it and does not burn through. That lengthens the life of the bulb and the higher temperature also gives a brighter light for the same wattage. More light, more life, less operating cost.",2718

Don't know what 'fewer ulcer syndrome' is.  Generally, any condition labeled a 'syndrome' is a condition that has an unknown cause and is just recognized by its symptoms and signs.  Has your baby been tested for Celiac Disease?  This is a common condition (estimated at 1 person in 100) where the person is allergic to the protein part of wheat and certain other grains.  This protein is called gluten (also gliadin).  It is a common cause of mouth ulcers and unexplained mouth ulcers should be reason enough to test for it.  Ask your doctor about this.  If the doc doesn't know then ask for a referral to a specialist (gastroenterologist).  This can be a very serious disease because it can eventually cause serious damage to the intestinal tract.

Sometimes if lucky enough, longer powering up even reaches to display the start-up screen but sometimes is too short that clicks on and off in short durations. This is like booting and rebooting done automatically by the computer. Is this a case of hardware problem and part has most probably been damaged? This is perfectly working before but not until now no new software/hardware was installed whatsoever. Please advise. ; There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors.",2780

You forgot to mention that not only are out schools overcrowded but they are also doing bi-lingual teaching which, if memory serves me correctly, is illegal in CA, and it hinders the learning process for the children who are english speaking only.

I quickly yanked my kid out of that particular school, went into another school district where  the non-english speaking children were taught in a different class for a certain amount of time during the school day so the other children were not distracted by the different language and they did not suffer in their studies.

Impact of stereotyping in the workplace.\n    a.Racial/ethnic groups targeted by   stereotypes. (Here, discuss the impact of stereotyping, and institutional racism of African Americans, Latinos, and other ethnic groups that are growing in population in America.\n    b.Discuss diversity initiatives developed by employers to combat stereotypes.\n    c. Melting Pot vs. Salad Bowl. Here discuss that modern day sociologists no longer use the ""Melting Pot"" to describe America. We use the Salad Bowl. A ""Melting Pot"" was found not to appreciate individual differences. We are all put in a big pot and mixed all together. We are taught that we have to be the same. With the ""Salad Bowl,"" you have your lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, etc....

Go to www.dictionary.com to get all of your definitions okay?\n     b. Is tolerance fair? State that it is not. Tolerate means to put up with? Do we really want to ""put up"" those Mexicans, or those Pakistani people? No! We want to be appreciative and accepting of their culture, their contributions to the changing color of America. Get the point? \n\nIV. Summary/Questions:\n     a. Do a wrap up of your presentation, and give your audience time to ask questions: Also, have a list of books ready for reference.

1,"when measuring force like pulling test it should resist a force of 14n? ; in measurung force i want to know what is the symbol n means ; N is Newtons, a unit that measures force. For every 1kg of something, if it accelerates at 1 meter per second per second (m/s/s or meters per seconds squared), than there is a force of 1N acting on it.\n\nForce is calculated by multiplying the mass (not weight) with the acceleration. For example, if you are 75kg, than there is a force of 75kg X 9.8 m/s/s (acceleration due to gravity: roughly constant on Earth) = 735N pulling you down. BUT, there is a reaction force, in this case the NORMAL, pushing you back up at the same time and force. Therefore, the force pulling you down, 735N, take away the NORMAL, also 735N, and you will have a NET FORCE of 0N because you are stationary. \n\nSo in order to resist something pulling at 14N (ignoring air resistance, friction, etc), it needs to pull back 14N.",2815

What should you do? ; I've had that issue more frequently lately, and I'm beginning to think it just may not be normal... ; It's a lack of circulation or:\n\nParesthesia (paraesthesia in British English) is a sensation of tingling, pricking, or numbness of the skin with no apparent physical cause, more generally known as the feeling of pins and needles. Transient paresthesia is usually caused by inadvertent pressure on a superficial nerve, such as sitting in a position for an extended period of time, and disappears gradually as the pressure is relieved. Other kinds of paresthesia, however, can be chronic and painful, and can come from a wide variety of sources.\n\nChronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of nerve cells, or neurons. This malfunction, which is especially common in older individuals, is often the result of poor circulation in the limbs, or may be caused by atherosclerosis—the build up of plaque on artery walls. Without a proper supply of blood and nutrients, nerve cells can no longer adequately send signals to the brain. Because of this, paresthesia is also a symptom of vitamin deficiency and malnutrition, as well as metabolic disorders like diabetes and hypothyroidism.\n\nIrritation to the nerve can also come from inflammation to the surrounding tissue. Joint conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome are common sources of paresthesia.\n\nAnother cause of paresthesia, however, may be direct damage to the nerves themselves, or neuropathy, which can stem from injury or infection, or which may be indicative of a current neurological disorder. Chronic paresthesia can sometimes be symptomatic of serious conditions, such as a transient ischemic attack, a brain tumor, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.\n\nParesthesiae of the mouth, hands and feet are common, transient symptoms of the related conditions of hyperventilation syndrome and panic attacks.\n\nOther known causes of paresthesia:\n\nAlcoholism \nAnticonvulsant drugs such as topiramate, sulthiame, and acetazolamide \nDehydration \nHeavy metals \nMigraines \nRadiation poisoning",2843

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.  Have faith that what you really need will be available to you when the need actually arrives.  Never lose hope...it is stronger than experience.  Live life!!!",2871

I would like to know if game multiplaying between students who use computers on the same network takes away internet connection from a person who is trying to use the web? Basically can game multiplaying affect internet connection over a network? Thanks. Laterz ; yes it does slow it down...and i would recomend that if a school is going to have a wireless network that more than 10 people connect on to have a T3 internet connection or faster.   \n\nT3 = 10 MBs\nDSL= 0.50 MBs,2892

1,"What causes a lunar eclipse? ; How does a lunar eclipse differ from the monthly lunar cycle? ; An eclipse refers to the phenomenon of one body passing into the shadow cast by another body. In astronomy, the best-known type of eclipse occurs whenever the Sun, Earth and Moon line up exactly. If this occurrence is at the time of a Full Moon where the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow, it is called a lunar eclipse. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depends upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital node. If the lining up of the Sun, Moon and Earth occurs at New Moon, the event is usually referred to as a solar eclipse (although the term is a misnomer and can more accurately be referred to as an occultation of the Sun by the Moon).",2896

9,"Since reparations has been given due to past crimes against humanity shouldn't African Americans receive also? ; Due to slavery and 400 yr+ of oppression also the unequal treatment of blacks in America due to White supremacy and injustice. ; Reparations in the United States have generally been limited to the survivors of government harm.  Watch your terminology, though - slavery was not a crime until 1865, since the government permitted slavery and only outlawed it through the Thirteenth Amendment after the Civil War.\n\nFor instance, the United States paid survivors of Japanese internment programs from WWII.  The program, however, was limited to survivors.  No survivors of slavery exist today.\n\nA current reparations program would be too bizarre to fathom.  All African-Americans were not harmed by slavery, after all, since some immigrated to America after slavery, or since some have no slave ancestors.  It would be virtually impossible to require proof of slave ancestry, and then to divide some sum proportionately.\n\nAdditionally, the vague ""400 yr+ of oppression"" is unhelpful in crafting legislation.  Slavery ended.  Segregation did exist also, that's ended for over 50 years now.  If you're problem with ""White supremacy and injustice,"" then I'm afraid that no amount of money will solve the problem.

9,"Why did Democrats choose the donkey for their mascot? ; Donkeys are asses and Elephants never forget. ; When Andrew Jackson ran for president in 1828, his opponents tried to label him a ""jackass"" for his populist views and his slogan, ""Let the people rule."" Jackson, however, picked up on their name calling and turned it to his own advantage by using the donkey on his campaign posters. During his presidency, the donkey was used to represent Jackson's stubbornness when he vetoed re-chartering the National Bank.\n\nThe first time the donkey was used in a political cartoon to represent the Democratic party, it was again in conjunction with Jackson. Although in 1837 Jackson was retired, he still thought of himself as the Party's leader and was shown trying to get the donkey to go where he wanted it to go. The cartoon was titled ""A Modern Baalim and his Ass"".\n\nInterestingly enough, the person credited with getting the donkey widely accepted as the Democratic party's symbol probably had no knowledge of the prior associations. Thomas Nast, a famous political cartoonist, came to the United States with his parents in 1840 when he was six. He first used the donkey in an 1870 Harper's Weekly cartoon to represent the ""Copperhead Press"" kicking a dead lion, symbolizing Lincoln's Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who had recently died. Nast intended the donkey to represent an anti-war faction with whom he disagreed , but the symbol caught the public's fancy and the cartoonist continued using it to indicate some Democratic editors and newspapers.\n\nLater, Nast used the donkey to portray what he called ""Caesarism"" showing the alleged Democratic uneasiness over a possible third term for Ulysses S. Grant. In conjunction with this issue, Nast helped associate the elephant with the Republican party. Although the elephant had been connected with the Republican party in cartoons that appeared in 1860 and 1872, it was Nast's cartoon in 1874 published by Harper's Weekly that made the pachyderm stick as the Republican's symbol. A cartoon titled ""The Third Term Panic,"" showed animals representing various issues running away from a donkey wearing a lion's skin tagged ""Caesarism."" The elephant labeled ""The Republican Vote,"" was about to run into a pit containing inflation, chaos, repudiation, etc..\n\nBy 1880 the donkey was well established as a mascot for the Democratic party. A cartoon about the Garfield-Hancock campaign in the New York Daily Graphic showed the Democratic candidate mounted on a donkey, leading a procession of crusaders.\n\nOver the years, the donkey and the elephant have become the accepted symbols of the Democratic and Republican parties. Although the Democrats have never officially adopted the donkey as a party symbol, we have used various donkey designs on publications over the years. The Republicans have actually adopted the elephant as their official symbol and use their design widely.\n\nThe Democrats think of the elephant as bungling, stupid, pompous and conservative -- but the Republicans think it is dignified, strong and intelligent. On the other hand, the Republicans regard the donkey as stubborn, silly and ridiculous -- but the Democrats claim it is humble, homely, smart, courageous and loveable.\n\nAdlai Stevenson provided one of the most clever descriptions of the Republican's symbol when he said, ""The elephant has a thick skin, a head full of ivory, and as everyone who has seen a circus parade knows, proceeds best by grasping the tail of its predecessor.""",2931

Please help! ; it sounds like you want to dropship furniture from an overseas manufacturer without having to warehouse anything.  That is going to be difficult since most ""reputable"" overseas companies are going to have minimum orders (container sizes) since the cost involved in shipping one piece of furniture or even a bedroom set would be cost prohibited.\n\nMy question is why do you need an overseas operation to begin with? There are plenty of US companies that offer distributors discounts and will dropship product.  All of the major furniture makers (ethan allen, broyhill, etc.) have closed up their US plants and are making the furniture overseas as it is.  There are still some US companies that would welcome new distributers.

THat way you don't actually need a merchant account and can accept virtually any kind of payment.

I have poor credit due to tax debt and am contemplating transfering the business to my (wonderful) girlfriend. ; It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nHere is a listing of federal grants for small businesses.

It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices.""

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

1,"What would happen if you dropped a small black hole on a planet? ; Say, about 1 -100 kg. Would it absorb the planet, or wolud it stabalize itself in the core? ; A 100 kg black hole would be incredibly small. A black hole is an object that has a density so great its escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. For a 100 kg weight to be that dense it would have to have a radius smaller than 1.48*10^-25 meter. That´s smaller than a quark. If such an absurd object could form it would still be just a 100 kilo weight. It wouldn´t suck the earth in. Immediately... Earth still weighs more. It would simply fall towards earth but when it reaches the surface it would just keep on falling as it would be too small to hit anything. It would fall straight through the core and start falling upwards until gravity would make it settle there. Eventually though some matter in the core would come so close it would be captured by it. Remember that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light to escape a black hole. So the mass of the black hole would increase with time, feeding on earth. And as its mass grows it would capture matter in an increasingly greater rate. Eventually you would have a black hole with the mass of earth (+100 kg) orbiting the sun instead of the lush, blue planet we all know and love.",3003

Does anyone know what I can do? ; Yes.If they've gone to collections or an attorney then they're on your report(s) and marked key derogatory or 30,60,90,120 days late.Sometimes the creditor will sell these written off accounts to resurgent companies.At that point you should contact the resurgent company and dispute with all three bureaus.\nOnce you dispute an account that's sold or written off the creditor has no claim to it anymore and will not reply to the dispute.Then the bureaus will remove the information.I did this very same thing and am paying Capital Management only 2477.00 back on 7079.00.They buy these accounts for just a few cents on the dollar and don't report to the bureaus.Resurgent companies don't want your credit ruined.\nBankruptcy is the very last resort.It screws up your credit almost as badly,and yes these bankruptcies go on your reports.\nBarring any of this contact an agency(like the ones you see commercials for) and they can help reduce your payments.I have to do this with my evil ex-wife because I unknowingly married into 27,000.00 of credit card debt.I think we used Credit Guard but I try to think of that experience as little as my failed marriage",3005

There are many\nof us on this earth that do not understand that the soul is realy them\nand not their body. We are all a part of a larger creative intelligence.\nOur souls are what connects us to this divine, creative intelligence.\nEach of us comes with a purpose to fulfill and expand that creative\ninteligence on the physical plain. As children we are more connected to\nour sould purpose. However as we grow older we allow the ""inculturation""\nof our society to move us away form our souls purpose and more toward\nour physical self. Yet our ony purpose is to create a world that is so\npure that that soul can manifest itself without the illusion of our\nphysical form.  The soul never dies.\n\nWe must all remember tis truth -\n    ""Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\n     Was not spoken of the soul.""\n\n\nWhen he writes that the soul is dead that slumbers, he means that if your soul is dormant or asleep it may as well be dead because you're not using it,\nWhen great men leave footprints in the sands of time, he means that they leave footprints in the sand that stand the test of time, they are remembered - they make a difference!\nCattle are the conformists - they do not think for themselves, society thinks for them, and they are all the same.\n\nThis is a very inspirational poem. The concept of living only in the present is a very difficult thing for me, as the regrets of the past and hopes of the future can be very troublesome and misleading at times. This brings out feelings of...almost like confidence. Strength and belief in oneself. The thought he expresses in this, one how to live through each day, is one I firmly sympathize with and believe in.\nThe meaning of this is very clear. Just live. Don't be hindered by the fear of oncoming, certain death, or whatever mistakes you may've made before, live by the second and only plan ahead that far. The is no concrete point in life, nothing is sure and steady, so don't live like it is going to be that way.\nThis has a very punctual, powerful rhythm. It works great for this, as the theme and message of it is a very strong, very passionate one. The wording, flow, everything in this goes perfectly hand in hand.

This means that if there are radically and very picky and emotially hurt people, they can apply those aspects of their scriptures and try to make them real.\n\nThird - Most all religions sees their books as a guidance and God graces passes through it. Islam's Koran is seen as the word of Allah, thus making it difficult to say that radical Islamist muslims are not following their book\n\nFourth - Many evangelical groups also focus on the Old Testament and apply intolerant and less compassionate aspects of God. In my book Jesus came to toss that understanding of God aside, but that is another subject.\n\nFifth - The Sikhs also have a sacred book and it is seen a their Guru. However, that book is treated and respected in temples...\n\nI beleive that learning how to communicate tames physical violence and brings a better way to find common grounds to share. Why we are having so much issues is when we blob religions together thinking that they give the same message of Peace. This illusion is not helping currently and creates insecurity, misunderstandings (such as the Cartoons incident) and bigger chasm. Many people really adhere to their religion and feel threathen when it is placed as something equal to other beleifs such as science, secularism, ideological and philosophical contributions to society.\n\nSo, no, religions absolutly do not have the same basis and even Goals.",3039

Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye.

Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street?

Most of the boys I work with were molested or raped and then started acting out, as sex offense crimes are a true vicious cycle with young victims often becoming criminals themselves.\n\nI would like to know if there are Proposition like this on the ballots in other states?   \nIf not how could we start getting more like this on the ballot, so we can stop this terrible cycle of crime? ; The small percentahg of offenders who don't affend again have been spiritually rehabilitated.\n\nanyway, there's a similiar type of law in KS",3101
3,"I need roughly 7000$ for my next school semester, does anyone know of where I can get help? ; My parents make too much money for me to get the extra aid I need. I was wondering if anyone knew of any place that could help me... ; The best place to go for information regarding financing your education is your school's financial aid office. They should point you in the right direction regarding financing options. Because your parents ""make too much money"" as is the case with the majority of college students, you will probably need to take out student loans. If you go through the U.S. Department of Education's Direct Loan program, the interest rates are extremely reasonable and payback schedules are flexible. \n\nBesides loans, you can also attain non-need-based grants, and scholarships through private institutions. Then, there are also work study programs. Although, admittedly, many of my friends did not like this option. \n\nPlease heed the deadlines for applications submissions as they are extremely important. Be open with your financial aid officers and let them know your concerns and they should give you some good advice.\n\nGood luck!",3103

Anyone know anything about that or can give me some links on that or on other developing technologies for alternative sources of energy away from gasoline and natural gas? ; The ground temperature several feet beneath your home is fairly constant at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take a few degrees. Circulating water or some other liquid through this region and returning it to your house, delivers to you a source to heat or cool your home to 60 degrees, even if the outside temperature is -10 degrees, or +120 degrees. Now you have solved most of your heating/cooling problems, and all you need is to let the outside air raise the inside temperature from 60 to 74 degrees in the summer, and install a simple secondary heating system (enough to only raise the temperature about 14 degrees) in the winter.

5,"Why do they bid to negotiate Japanese pitcher's? ; I don't understand why they have to negotiate to talk to Japanese pitcher's? who gets that money the player? We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

6,"what are the advantages and disadvantages of finance on a personal basis? ; i need information on if britain is becoming a debt ridden society and have to compare adv and dis ad ; The advantage of taking out a loan is that you keep whatever savings or capital that you may have intact, for other investment purposes. This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard. This is a very expensive use of money indeed!\n\nIn the UK, currently, a significant amount of personal debt is financed at high-ish interest rates.

He doesn't do chores around the house or pay for groceries: he does nothing to contribute around here. He doesn't even contribute to the raising of the kids he had with my sister: he doesn't pay for the kids needs, he leaves everything to my sister. all he does when he's not working is go out partying and getting drunk, obsess about his computer, play hockey or park his butt on the couch and watch hockey or wrestling. And when things go wrong even if its his fault, itssomeone elses fault in his mind. My major concern is his threats of violence: today he had a fight with my sisters babysitter (his fault) and he threatened to burn the the house down or, in his words ""cause a bloodbath"". What should I do? I'm scared. ; BEFORE YOU READ THIS,  You accept that I am just giving my opinion, and NOT giving legal advice, else you should NOT read further.  You agree not to act on my opinions stated herein, and seek the council of a legal professional when ultimately making a decision to act.\n\nREVISED.  He has children with your sister?

If the house belongs to your family, and you sister seems to be in control of the house.  AND chooses to allow him to stay, then what OTHER options are there?  Your sister has to do the kicking out.  You can do it, but it seems you are not in a position to defend yourself.  You need to bring in someone who can help, either law enforcement, or otherwise.  A rich friend or Strong Friend to Kick his A%% out of there.\nThat said...\n\nYOu didn't say who he threatened.  You?  If so, you really need to get out of there, even if you are not convinced he would cause you harm.  If someone says it, they are capable of acting on it.  You don't need to stay there, and yes if he said he would cause you bodily harm, you can call the authorities and have him charged for assault.  Sadly, the police don't and won't do much for you on this. The laws are set up to protect the guilty.  Without witness it is him agains you.  Remember that.  You are in a no win situation really.\n\nYour sister has made a choice to be with this person.\nYOU NEED TO MOVE OUT...\nWhat you do after that is up to you.(pressing charges for instance)\n\nIf you feel she is in danger , call the police.\nIf you feel her kids are in danger call Child Protective Services. (remember they can make someone's life miserable), so don't do that unless you truly feel the kids are in danger.\n\nIMPORTANTLY this is my opinion, and any ideas given here must be taken as such.  If you want real legal advise, you should consult with an attorney in your area of jusisdiction.\n\nYou don't like this guy, and it sounds like you have a good reason, but you NEED to remember, your sister has made the choice to have him there.  YOU can leave. You don't have to stay there, and even if it is an inconvenience, you move and find a more peaceful place to live.  Better for you in the end anyways.\n\nSOrry for you, but you chose to (OR NOT TO) live there.  Your sister is a big girl, let her make her own decisions.\nYou never stated her feelings about this.  Is she scared to kick him out?  Again, if so, she needs to get law enforcement involved.  Restraining orders are a start.  At least then if he shows up, he can be arrested.  This is not an easy situation.  You should try to find as much support as you can BEFORE making moves.\n\nI know this is to the point and a bit sharp, but those are the  real life choices you have to make.  Good luck and best wishes to you!\n\nMove out.",3158

6,"adsense revenue? ; why am I only getting 0.95 for 5 clicks on (insurance keyword) on my google adsense account? I thought that insurance keywords were worth alot, like 3-15 dollars a click? ; Top keywords list that say a keyword costs anywhere from 3-15 dollars is one thing; and the real income received from the publisher is another thing. Google Adsense has what is called ""smart pricing"" which either discounts or jack up the cost to an advertiser depending on how likely a web page will convert for the advertiser. What you are experiencing is a classic case of smart pricing. You've been smartpriced out of what you thought was a high keyword\n\nFrom the Google webpage, here is how they define smart pricing http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/18989.html\n\n""Because contextually targeted ads on our content network sometimes return lower conversion numbers than ads on Google.com search results pages, clicks from the content network use ""smart pricing"" adjustments. Google's smart pricing technology automatically lowers the cost of content clicks based on the referring site, to maximize the return on investment for advertisers. \n\nIf our data shows that clicks from a particular content page are less likely to return results, our system automatically reduces the price the advertiser pays for those clicks. The AdWords system takes the work out of CPC bidding, helping to ensure strong return on investment no matter where your ads appear. Smart pricing adjustments are automatically reflected in the average CPC for content targeting shown in the Campaign Management interface. \n\nAs an example of smart pricing, consider two websites, each related to digital photography. The first page features digital camera reviews, while the second offers photography tips. Clicks from the page of photography tips might be charged less, because they are expected to convert into sales less frequently, resulting in lower value for advertisers. Google data determines that clicks from the digital camera reviews convert better, so clicks from this page are not discounted.""",3162

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

4,"What is object oriented programming? ; I dont know a lot about computer, but I heard my friend talk about object oriented programming.\nWhat is object oriented programming?\nWhat are its major elements?\nIs it an important concept in programming? Why so? ; If you've never used an object-oriented language before, you need to understand the underlying concepts before beginning to write code. You need to know what an object is, what a class is, how objects and classes are related, and how objects communicate by using messages.\n\nObject-oriented programming. Objects of the program interact by sending messages to each other.\n\nWhat Is an Object? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An object is a software bundle of related variables and methods. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects you find in everyday life. \n\nWhat Is a Message? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    Software objects interact and communicate with each other using messages. \n\nWhat Is a Class? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind. \n\nWhat Is Inheritance? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class inherits state and behavior from its superclass. Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring software programs. \n\nWhat Is an Interface? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An interface is a contract in the form of a collection of method and constant declarations. When a class implements an interface, it promises to implement all of the methods declared in that interface. \n\nHow Do These Concepts Translate into Code? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    This section looks at a small applet, and shows you the code that creates objects, implements classes, sends messages, establishes a superclass, and implements an interface.\n\nfor the importance part\n\nObject-oriented programming is claimed to give more flexibility, easing changes to programs, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Furthermore, proponents of OOP claim that OOP is easier to learn for those new to computer programming than previous approaches, and that the OOP approach is often simpler to develop and to maintain, lending itself to more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than other programming methods. Translation from real-world phenomena/objects (and conversely) is eased because there is direct mapping from the real-world to the object-oriented program (generally a many-to-one). The converse mapping, from the object-oriented program back to the real-world, is by way of a one-to-many mapping, where each 'many' is seen to be a collection of well-defined subsets (or superset), which together compose a real-world object. The corresponding object defined in the program may be seen as representing some proper subset of the real-world object's features.",3183

5,"Give me a good reason why De La Hoya can't knock out ""Pretty Girl"" Mayweather? ; Oscar is bigger, hits harder, (ask Vargas & Mayorga!) and is just as skilled as Mayweather. Mayweather was badly hurt against Chop Chop Corley who isn't even a big puncher. I think his chin is questionable, it's just a matter of someone getting to it, and Oscar has all the tools to get to that chin and end this fight by knockout! Tell me why he can't? ; Lovely Lady Vette ~\n                               There isn't a reason why he can't knockout Floyd, Floyd's style is tailor made for Oscar, everybody wants to say that ""Floyd Sr, training Oscar will be the biggest difference in this fight"" and I write to you and everybody else nonsense! Oscar has the one key weapon to beat the tuck and roll style that all the Mayweathers used, the same weapon Julio Cesar Chavez used to dismantle Floyd's Uncle Roger, the left hook.\n\n      When Julio fought Roger, who Floyd fights exactly like it was the left hook that landed and hurt Roger and allowed Julio to go upstairs on Roger. Gilberto Reyes came up with the plan to attack Rogers body at all cost, no matter what Roger threw Julio was to stay on the body and keep throwing his left hook to Rogers liver for the first 5 rounds nothing but BODY, BODY, BODY. Any fighter who tries to stand there and exchange and unload bombs on Floyd's head will lose. He's way too slick for that. The body attack is key here.\n\n   Oscar is a converted Southpaw meaning when he was a little kid his father switched his left handed stance around and made him fight as a right handed fighter all Oscars power is in his left hook. Oscar knows the value of a great body shot, a perfect example would be his fight with Hopkins. Floyd Sr. knows that this is key to beating his son and jumped on the Bandwagon for a estimated 3 million dollars, so he can look like the brain trust and Architect who came up with the plan to beat Floyd when Oscar had the tools all along.\n\n     Thank you for the great question Loverly Lady Vette.",3231

I do not eat a lot what so ever, in fact I think I take in appx 1200 calories a day... I want to lose 10 lbs very quickly, what else do I need to do? ; You need to have high intensity and increase sessions to 1.5 hours here is a plan I follow. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit.  \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.",3254
1,"PHYSICS PROBLEM.. can you answer it? ; Bob and Joe, 2 construction workers on the roof of a building, are about to raise up a keg of nails from the ground by means of a rope passing over a pulley 16 m above the ground. Bob has a mass of 100 kg, Joe 80 kg, the keg 40 kg, and the nails 80 kg. Bob and Joe slip off the roof and the following unfortunate sequence of events takes place. \n\nBob and Joe, hanging on the rope together, strike the ground just as the keg hits the pulley. Unnerved by the fall, Bob lets go of the rope, thus the falling keg pulls Joe back up to the roof where he cracks his head against the pulley but gamely hangs on. However, the bottom falls out of the keg of nails when it strikes the ground. The empty keg rises to the top as Joe returns to the ground. Finally, Joe has had enough and lets go of the rope as he remains on the ground, only to be hit by the empty keg. \n\nIgnoring the possible mid-air collisions, how long did it take for this drama to unfold? use -10 for acc. of gravity. ; Hope this helps...\nBreak this question down into four independent events.  1) Bob and Joe falling, 2) Keg with nails falling, 3) Joe falling, 4) Keg falling.\n\nIf you look at one specific event, then you can assume that both sides of the pulley start at rest (since either it starts that way, or some poor guy smacks the ground or the pulley).  Therefore: look for Fnet on the total masses on the rope.  Take for instance, the first episode, where Bob and Joe (Total mass 180kg) is against the keg and nails (120kg).  Since F=ma, then the individual forces on Bob and Joe = 180(10) and the keg and nails 120(10).  So, Fnet would be 180(10)-120(10) for this specific case.  Then, you would look at the total Force, the total mass, and the acceleration of the entire system.  Once you have the acceleration, then you can easily figure out time, since you have a 16m pulley height (you have to assume Bob and Joe are starting at pulley height, otherwise the problem is unsolvable).  Just use the -1/2at^2+Vot+do=D equation, and since there is no Vo, this should be easy.\n\nDo this for each subsequent episode with the varying masses, and that should give you your total time.  Oh, and the rope has to be massless and the pulley frictionless, too.\n\nAnd unless I'm totally missing something, just plug and chug.  Good luck!",3255

But has it worked or does it really have any jurisdiction over its members, no.  Many nations, such as the United States of America, have failed to ratify much of the UN charter.  For example, the US has not ratified the International Criminal Court, a separate judiciary entity somewhat affiliated with the UN.  However, the UN does play a somewhat integral part in maintaining communication with outside nations. A great example is the UN's efforts to aid with peacekeeping in Darfur.  Though this is seemingly unsuccessful, the UN has worked to maintatin the prescence of peacekeeping troops in the region. \n\nHowever, this leads to more problems.  Throughout the years, peacekeeping troops have been known to rape their refugees and commit other inappropriate acts during their mission. This increases the negative opinion of the UN and its actions among nations.  In addition, when nations such as the US blatantly violate the charter and the UN declarations, it suggests the ignorance of global opinion. These events lead to greater tension between nations instead of increased pacifism, as the body is designed for. \n\nNo nation, due to the act of sovereignty, must abide by the laws of the UN.  This is solely because if the rules of the UN were more heavily imposed than national law, prominent UN nations, the UK, US, France, etc., would have greater precedence in the domestic politics of smaller nations, such as Swaziland.  This would lead to an almost imperialistic setting where global superpowers would be able to enact laws that colonized developing nations and poverished nations.\n\nI hope this answers your question!",3340

1,"Why there is redshift & violetshift if planets move close or away?If wavelength changes then why? ; I understand that the redshift and violetshift is due to change in wave-length. What is my doubt is that why there is change in wavelength. Is it like wave is compressed or stretched? Is is like that, that wave has to accomodate it self between earth and corresponding planet? ; good question....its kind of complicated but basically, one type of Red Shift is similar to the doppler effect for sound. When an ambulance screams towards you the siren gets noticable higher pitched, then when it races away the pitch drops. This is because the sound waves are traveling at a fixed speed  toward your ears, but the fast movement of the ambulance is changing the frequency, or the rate at which those waves hit you. it is essentially smushing more of the sound waves together as it approaches you and stretching them out as it moves away. This same principle applies to light and all electromagnetic waves. \n\nThe other type of red shift include cosmological redshit, and gravitational or (relativistic red shift). \n\nCosmological red shift can occur as space it self expands, this expansion of space expands the actual photons and inturn drops the frequency of the light towards red. \n\nGravitational Red Shift can occur when ever light passed through a gravitational field. Gravity imposses a time dilation effect on anyting in the field and so photons are also subject to this. The result is the drop in frequency towards red. \n\n(it is also important to note that the red shift also applies to all electro magnetic waves visible or not, and in cases where the light would be infra red or already at a lower frequency than red, a red shift would actually shift that wave further away from red.)",3363

1,"does heating a substance change its mass?! ...? ; if it does then how..?! ... what happens when heating that changes the mass of a substance. ; Only if E=MC^2\n\n... it follows that if there is a change in the rest-energy of a body, there must be a corresponding change in its rest-mass. For example, if a body is heated, and thereby absorbs a small amount of energy ΔE (as measured in the frame of reference in which the body is at rest), its rest-mass will increase by a very small amount equal to ΔE/c2. This increase is tiny because of the high numerical value of the speed of light. Indeed, for mid-sized objects, such an increase in mass would be too small to measure with even the most accurate balance. For example, if a 1 kg block of gold is heated so that its temperature increases by 10 °C, then, ceteris paribus, its mass would increase by as much as 1.4 × 10-14 kg; a cube of gold of this additional tiny mass would have sides smaller than one one-thousandths of a millimeter. Similarly, if a body emits an amount of energy ΔE, say in the form of light or heat, its rest-mass will decrease by a tiny amount ΔE/c2. In both cases, the important and novel claim made by SR is that the inertial mass of a body can change depending on whether it absorbs or emits energy. This is true, of course, not just for isolated mid-sized objects but for any physical system.",3524

In other words we see all things happening there(at star) with double speed.\n    Similarly the photons traveling away from us carrying info. about us will be catched back when we travel faster then light and we will be able to see our past pictures towards the direction opposite from us.\n    Nothing will happen to our physical structure(If we assume that nothing will happen to the molecular chains of our body at that speed), \n We say, at velocity of light the mass of a particle become infinite, that actually means we are not able to push it farther, for example if we push it away by a laser beam that also travel with velocity of light,it will become impossible for a shower of rays to push it farther when the aim is also traveling WIth similar speed.

Curious if I continue to wait what the risks might be.  My husband are trying to have a child with no luck and it is painful to make love.  We want a child desperatly but I am not sure if I can handle the pain after sex much longer.  Any suggestions? ; I have polycystic ovary syndrome, and part of that is that I have lots of little cysts on my ovaries.  The most common potentially dangerous thing that I have heard of happening with cysts is that they can burst (depending on what kind of ovarian cyst that you have).  I had this happen once.  It was extremely painful and I felt nauseous, but after a few hours I was completely fine.  Ruptured cysts almost always heal on their own, but they're painful and have a small chance of infection.  I know you want to have a child, but sometimes birth control pills help with cyst problems (also depends on what kind of cysts you have).  If you can't get your surgery scheduled any sooner, perhaps you should ask about going on the pill just until something else can be done for them.

For a station in Earth orbit something higher than 9 km/s seems reasonable, less for lower inclination orbits.\n\nOnce you've got that you then need the exhaust velocity of your rocket, it would depend on what you are using but you can get some rough values from the first source.\n\nWith that the mass ratio is the exhaust velocity times the natural log (ln key on scientific calculators) of the Δv.\n\nThe mass ratio is the difference between the starting and ending mass of the rocket so the amount of fuel will be the (mass ratio minus one) times the mass of the rocket structure + payload.\n\nYou'll probably get something absurdly large (it's very hard to exceed 10 in the real world) and if so then you've got to use staging which makes it a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Soyuz FG which launches the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to the ISS has about 280 tonnes of propellant at launch over all three stages for a spacecraft lighter than 8 tonnes.

1,"How come when it rains, some times there's thunder and lightening with the rain and sometimes there's not? ; And how come sometimes there's wind with the rain and some times there's not? ; Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth. At the same time, it also is one of the least understood. While lightning is simply a gigantic spark of static electricity (the same kind of electricity that sometimes shocks you when you touch a doorknob), scientists do not have a complete grasp on how it works, or how it interacts with solar flares impacting the upper atmosphere or the earth's electromagnetic field.\nLightning has been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes. However, it is most often seen in thunderstorms.At any given moment, there can be as many as 2,000 thunderstorms occurring across the globe. This translates to more than 14.5 MILLION storms each year. NASA satellite research indicated these storms produce lightning flashes about 40 times a second worldwide.This is a change from the commonly accepted value of 100 flashes per second which was an estimate from 1925. Whether it is 40, 100, or somewhere in between, we live on an electrified planet.\n\nThe Sound of Thunder\nRegardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000°F (30,000°C), a temperature that is five times the surface of the sun! When lightning occurs, it heats the air surrounding its channel to that same incredible temperature in a fraction of a second.\n\nLike all gases, when air molecules are heated, they expand. The faster they are heated, the faster their rate of expansion. But when air is heated to 54,000°F in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon known as ""explosive expansion"" occurs. This is where air expands so rapidly that it compresses the air in front of it, forming a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. Exploding fireworks produce a similar result.\n\nWhat is the difference between a thundershower and a thunderstorm?  \nTechnically, there is none. In general, the term ""thundershower"" tends to denote a fairly weak storm with light to moderate rainfall and low levels of lightning activity. However, there are no defined parameters that distinguish between a thundershower and a thunderstorm. In fact, in order to avoid confusion, we in the National Weather Service do not use the term ""thundershower"". If a shower is strong enough to produce lightning, even just one single bolt, it's called a thunderstorm.\n\nTo Learn More about Lightning and Thunder go to \nhttp://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_intro.htm\n\nLIGHTNING SAFETY A MUST READ\nLightning is the MOST UNDERRATED weather hazard. On average, only floods kill more people. Lightning makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts.\n\nIn the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes COMBINED. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nLightning is one of the most capricious and unpredictable characteristics of a thunderstorm. Because of this, no one can guarantee an individual or group absolute protection from lightning. However, knowing and following proven lightning safety guidelines can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death. Remember, YOU are ultimately responsible for your personal safety, and should take appropriate action when threatened by lightning.\n\nWhile no place is 100% safe from lightning, some places are much safer than others.\nWhere to Go Where NOT to Go \nThe safest location during a thunderstorm is inside a large enclosed structure with plumbing and electrical wiring. These include shopping centers, schools, office buildings, and private residences.\n\nIf lightning st",3565

I've always wondered this... ; When you bloat, you get well.. pudgey. Like your pants don't fit right and you look like you blew up a bit. Cramps are just the affect of your uterus opening up. ( Ever have children?) It;s like when you have contractions when going into labor. Your body has to open up your uterus to a certain extenet to get the baby out, but when it's just your period, it opens it up only so much to let the blood flow through. And also you might want to consult your doctor and talk to them about it. They can give you all kinds of information about your menstrual cycle.",3586

When I was younger I wore a hellish back brace for 2 1/2 years 24/7. In my case the curvature progressed. Two years ago I had scoliosis surgery. I was 18 and had an ""S"" curve (56 thorasic & 68 lumbar). Dr. Munish Gupta at UC Davis in California was my surgeon. He did a WONDERFUL job! 12 vertebrae were fused and 3 (only looks like 2) titanium rods were put in to straighten my back. It worked! I was so scared of having surgery. Scared of what could go wrong. My fears did have merit as things can go wrong, but if I could go back and do it all again, I would! I now wish I had had surgery sooner. I even LOVE the scar down my back (and the small one from the bone graft on my hip) and gained about an inch in height.\nAnother testament to the fact that the surgery was a success is that fact that as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I do not accept blood transfusions. With a surgery this big one tends to loose blood, but because my surgeon agreed to use bloodless surgery equipment it was no problem! Everything went perfectly. I have also been in two major car accidents since my surgery and nothing broke or was damaged. I also actively ride horses, swim, and do everything I did before the surgery (ok, I do MORE now!). I have even been told I can go bungee jumping and on roller coasters if I want! hehe\n\nFeel free to contact me if you ever want to talk about surgery or anything.

The spermatophore is typically reserved for the more primitive insects like collembola (springtails) and other wingless varieties. Scorpions will also use spermatopheres, but once again they are fairly primitive.\nMany orthopterans will have a plug which they insert into the female which acts to block or inhibit any other males from mating, this is sometimes refered to as the spermatophore.

These studs can be metal or plastic and screw into the bottom of the boot sole.\n\nFirm ground boots come with the studs already molded (usually 13) on the sole of the boot.  They can be small studs or in case of the newer boots nowadays, blades.\n\nUnless you are playing at an elite level, where you are playing on very good grass pitches that are properly maintained and watered, it is probably a waste of time buying '6 studs'.  Best to stick with the molded boots.\n\nKeep in mind too that if you play in a climate where rain is quite frequent (UK, etc.) it might be better to buy the 6 studs as you will be playing the majority of your games in those conditions.\n\nBest solution, if you can afford it, is buy a pair of each.\n\n:)",3676

I already tried unistalling and re-installing WMP. Also, when I try to play Sims 2 I can't hear the background sounds. HELP! Please! ; Step 1: Checking volume and mute settings:\n\nThe volume setting for one or more sound devices might be disabled or set too low. Use the following steps to adjust volumes to their correct levels:\n\nIn Windows XP, click Start, and then click Control Panel.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel \nIn Windows XP, open Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices, and then click Sound and Audio Devices.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, open Sounds and Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab. \nIn Windows XP, click the Advanced button under Device Volume.\nIn Windows 98 and Me, click the Volume button under Sound Playback. \nRemove all checkmarks from Mute boxes at the bottom of the Master Volume window and adjust the volume setting slide bars to their highest positions. Close the Master Volume window and test for sound. If there is still no sound, go to the next Step. \n\nStep 2: Verifying the connections:\n\nUse the following steps to verify that the sound cables are properly connected from the speaker to the computer (cable connectors and plug assignments are normally color-coded to aid with connections).\n\nUnplug the sound cable. \nPlug headphones or one speaker directly into the speaker out connector on the back of the computer. The speaker out connector may have a symbol of a speaker \nor a circle with an arrow pointing out, or it may just say ""OUT"" next to it. Test for sound using the computer. If sound does not work, go to ""Step 3: \n\nIf sound is restored when the headphones or one speaker is plugged in, replace the original sound cable with a new sound cable and test for sound. Sound should be restored after replacing the sound cable. If sound does not come back after replacing the cable, the sound card needs to be replaced because the speaker out connector is bad.\n\nStep 3: Configuring on-board sound in the BIOS:\n\nSome computers come with sound on the motherboard (on-board), and some computers use a sound card. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS has to be set according to your particular sound configuration. Perform the following steps to correctly configure the sound in the BIOS:\n\nLook at the back of your computer and use one of the following three items to determine the proper sound configuration and sound setting: \nIf the plugs for the speakers and microphones are located next to the parallel, serial, or USB ports, then the computer has on-board sound. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS should be Enabled. If the plugs for the speakers and microphone are located away from the other ports and sit in an area by themselves, the computer has a soundcard. The on-board sound setting (if there is one) in the BIOS should be Disabled. If the computer has sound plugs in both locations, a \nsoundcard has been added to the computer that already contains on-board sound. The on-board sound setting should be Disabled. To enter the BIOS, turn on the computer and when the first screen appears, press the F1 key repeatedly until the BIOS Setup screen opens. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to select the Advanced tab. Press the DOWN ARROW key to select Onboard Audio Options and press ENTER. If Onboard Audio Options is not available, select I/O Device Configuration and press ENTER. If Audio Codec is listed, select it and press ENTER. Select either Enabled or Disabled depending on your \nconfiguration and press ENTER. Press the F10 key and then press ENTER to save and exit Start Windows and check for sound. If there is still no sound, continue to the next Step.\n\nStep 4: Restoring the sound drivers\n\nUse the recovery process to restore individual drivers for a sound or combination sound-modem card. \n\nIf the computer came with recovery discs (Windows 98 and Me), place the last disc of the set into the top disc drive and follow the on-screen menus as they appear. Restart the computer after restoring the sound driver software and test for sound.\nIf there is still no sound, continue to ",3694

8,"weed any one know bout it? ; how long does the affects of pot usualey last after u smoke it.. ; Q: How long does marijuana stay in the user's body?\nA: THC in marijuana is rapidly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs. Generally, traces (metabolites) of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session. However, in chronic heavy users, traces can sometimes be detected for weeks after they have stopped using marijuana.\n\nQ: What happens if you smoke marijuana?\nA: The way the drug affects each person depends on many factors, including:\n- user's previous experience with the drug; \nhow strong the marijuana is (how much THC it has); \n- what the user expects to happen; \n- where the drug is used; \n- how it is taken; and \n- whether the user is drinking alcohol or using other drugs. \nSome people feel nothing at all when they smoke marijuana. Others may feel relaxed or high. Sometimes marijuana makes users feel thirsty and very hungry—an effect called ""the munchies.""\nSome users can undergo bad effects from marijuana. They may suffer sudden feelings of anxiety and have paranoid thoughts. This is more likely to happen when a more potent variety of marijuana is used.\n\nQ: What are the short-term effects of marijuana use?\nA: The short-term effects of marijuana include: \n- problems with memory and learning (11);\n- distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch) (6); \n- trouble with thinking and problemsolving (5); \n- loss of motor coordination; and \n- increased heart rate. \nThese effects are even greater when other drugs are mixed with the marijuana; and users do not always know what drugs are given to them.",3702

Dont you dare. He should always back you up - you are the one he is married to. I think you need to find alternate arrangements for babysitting. Quietly, with dignity, make other arrangements. If the grandma and aunty are not respecting your wishes, what makes you think they wont be disrespecting you infront of your kids? Try to put some distance between you and his family, so you and your husband can form your own tight knit unit. Then when you want to, you can see them on your terms.

6,"Who is to blame for the gross personl debt in the USA? ; Is the credit card companies, banks, financial institutons, or the poor money management of each indidvidual? ; A combination of many factors. To start, marketing is one of the main reasons for personal debt because several companies market their products in a way that is irresistable to customers (e.g., no money down, no interest for 12 months). In addition, as customers we are constantly demanding more, therefore, companies respond by selling us more of what we want. So if you really try to look into the problem objectively, you have no one to blame but yourself. Nobody forced you to buy on credit, to ""want"" things you don't really ""need"", to compare yourself to your neighbors. You have to take responsibility for your own actions. It's always easier to find someone else to blame it makes us all feel better. It's harder to admit that we are responsible adults who must get used to making responsible decisions. Next time you get a credit card offer, shredd it. Next time you go shopping for something, ask yourself ""do I really need that? Can I live without it? Can I afford it?"" then make your decision after you answer those questions. I hope my answer was somewhat helpful. Good luck!",3719

1,"what holds the photoreceptors? ; its on a worksheet called ""the eyes have it"" and i need all the answers!!! lol ; The photoreceptors are located in the retina of the eye.  The outer segments of the photoreceptors are responsible for catching photons of light, which initiates an electochemical signal that ultimately results in vision.  There are two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in lower light levels, while cones are responsible for color and most form recognition.  Rods are dispersed throughout the retina, while cones are most densely packed in the region of the retina responsible for your central, or ""straight ahead,"" vision.  This area is called the macula.  In fact, the center of the macula, the fovea, contains only cones, and they are very densely packed in this area to allow for higher resolution of fine detail.",3785
6,"characteristics of earnings management from good, no consequence to bad.? ; when and how earnings management constitute financial fraud ; The CPA Journal article “Abusive Earnings Management and Early Warning Signs,” by Lorraine Magrath and Leonard G. Weld (August 2002), distinguished between earnings management activities that are simply good business practices and abusive earnings management intended to deceive the financial community. Good business practices include the following activities:\n\nCareful timing of capital gains and losses; \nUse of conferencing technology to reduce travel costs; and \nPostponement of repair and maintenance activities when faced with unexpected cash flow declines. \n\nOn the other hand, abusive earnings management results from actions such as those cited in the SEC section 704 Report:\n\nImproper revenue recognition; \nImproper expense recognition; and \nUsing reserves to inflate earnings in years with falling revenues. \n\nMagrath and Weld identified six relationships that investors and auditors should consider as early warning signs of abusive earnings management:\n\nCash flows that are not correlated with earnings; \nReceivables that are not correlated with revenues; \nAllowances for uncollectible accounts that are not correlated with receivables; \nReserves that are not correlated with balance sheet items; \nAcquisitions with no apparent business purpose; and \nEarnings that consistently and precisely meet analysts’ expectations",3786

9,"could i be gay..? ; im pretty sure im not gay but everytime i look at naked men i get aroused, i heard that this is normal and it happens to most guys. ; How to tell if you're gay: \n1. If you are over 30 and you have a washboard stomach, you are gay. It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and rather you've been sucking-off the boys and have spent the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah diet. \n\n\n\n2. If you have a cat, you are a Flaaaayming gay. A cat is like a dog, but gay: it grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch except when it uses its nails, and whines to be fed. And just think about how you call a dog...""Killer, come here! I said get your butt over here!"" Now think about how you call a cat... ""Bun-bun, come to daddy, snookums!"" Jeeezus, you're fit to be framed, you're so gay. \n\n\n\n3. If you suck on lolipops, Ring-Pops, baby-pacifiers, or any such nonsense, rest assured, you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks bar-b-q ribs, crab-claws, raw oysters, craw-fish guts, pickled pigs feet, or titties. Anything else and you are in training to suck El Dicko and undeniably gay. \n\n\n\n4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking lot, you're in a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his bathroom, he defecates and urinates where he pleases.\n\n\n5. If you drink decaf coffee with skim milk, you like a high hard one in the poop-chute. Coffe is to be had strong, black (or with thick, wholesome milk) and full-aroma. A vagina-eating man will never be heard ordering a ""Decaf Cafe Latte with Skim"" and he will never, ever know what artificial sweetner tastes like. If you've had Nutrasweet in your mouth, you've had a dick there too. \n\n\n\n6. If you know more than six names of colors or four different types of dessert, you might as well be handing out free passes to your bung. A real man doesn't have memory space in his brain to remember all of that crap as well as all the names of all the players in the Major league, NFL, NBA, college ball, PGA, and Nascar. If you can pick out chartreusse or you know what a ""fresier"" is you're gay. And if you can name ANY type of textile other than denim, you are faggadocious! \n\n\n\n7. If you drive with both hands on the wheel, forget it...you hungry for meat-popsicle. A man only puts both hands on the wheel to honk at a slow driver or to cut the dude off. The rest of the time he needs that hand to change the radio station, eat his hamburger, hold his beer, finger the bi-atch in the passenger seat (whoever she happens to be), or, if he's Latino, talk on his cell-phone. \n\n\n\n8. If you enjoy romantic comedies or French films, mon-frere, vous sonnez le Gay, oui? The only time it is acceptable to watch one of those is with a woman who knows how to reward her man. Watching any of the above films by yourself or with another man is likely to result in SHC (spontaneous homosexual combustion), which is what happens to fags when they flame out too quickly.",3823
0,"For all you Christians? ; What is the age that a girl should start thinking about men?\nNow think about this. \nHow old was Mary the Mother of Jesus?\nHow old was Josef the earthly Father of Jesus?\nHow old is god?\nIf what everyone says is true then God is a Pedophile ; Ok that’s a little weird. I want to truthfully answer your question even though you have attempted to set traps. You see age is not the issue you’re attempting to make it. In some countries the life expectancy of a man is under 45 years of age and in many places in the Bible we find that men in other areas have lived in excess 500 years. Certainly life and coupling practices are different under both circumstances. So while age and culture vary the truth you seek is at what age is a given woman old enough to make life impacting decisions on her own. We see that many cultural differences answer that differently how ever being a man who loved too early and now has daughters prone to make the same bad choices, I have found truth in the area of your interest and it is this. First a child must grow enough to read and write and think deep thoughts a child should then contemplate the great depths a life could travel and the results a life could feel because of choices made. A child should realize that there is a higher power and a help in the living of that life. That child should seek first that powerful assistant and His support. Seeking that first could not possibly cause you to miss the match that would have been known to you as the perfect match. However seeking Him first guarantees that when the time is right He will bring to you the one that is meant for you. A woman should wait until God makes the match so that she doesn’t ruin the perfect union with baggage left over from youthful mistakes and indiscretions based only on the physical urges children. You know in some countries adulthood is not recognized until a person reaches their 30’s Perfection does not play worldly games and does not make sence to mankind.

That would be only fitting, after all.\n\n    And... failing any of that, then the next-best thing would be to simply turn Saddam loose with our apologies and reinstate him as President of Iraq.

(Too bad it had to cost anywhere between 100,000 and 600,000 innocent Iraqi lives (and those of around 3,000 of our troops) for us to get to this point.) ; Graig C, I don't believe that Saddam is going to be executed. His next trials will drag on for 2 more years until next president will forgive him. Bush only hyped Saddam's execution before the election for political purposes. Bush can't be charged for mass murdering innocent people and thousands of our troops because of the patriotic act he signed. That was indeed shrewed of the neoconservatives. Yes, Saddam was a bad dictator and perhaps deserves to be killed, but he was not the worst dictator. Why is Bush picking on Saddam? USA built him up and made him bad. Rumsfeldt dealt with Saddam and supported him in the past. USA saved Saddam's butt in the past from many assassinations designed by his Shiites rebels. They gave him all the weapons and chemicals to defend himself from those Shiites rebels. Now because Saddam refused to cooperate with the USA like Qaddafi did and because we need Saddam's oil, so he is no good? What about Sudan's President Al-Bashir, who is killing innocent people left and right in Darfur? What about Libya's president, Qaddafi the horrible dictator? What about Egypt's president, Mr. Mubarak, the selfish bad dictator? What about Syria's President, Mr. Al-Assad, who is killing and jailing his opponents every day? What about Saudi Arabia King and his Sheiks, who hate Christians and oppressing outsiders (not Saudis)? Should we invade their countries and execute those dictators as well? C'mon Republicans, Is this logical? It is fine if you want to bully people around and control the oil resources in the world, but this is not the way to do it.

First and second class levers have their input and output forces on opposite sides of the fulcrum. Causing you to use less force, but at the cost of disance. A third class lever has the input force and output force (object being lifted) on the same side of the fulcrum.

1,"Tell me more about immature stage of termite? ; Scientific reply ; Termites undergo incomplete metamorphosis: \n\ni.e. the eggs hatch into nymphs that are a small copy of the adult specimen. They go thru a development cycle of : \n\n1:Egg > 2:nymph > 3:adult \n\nAs the nymph grows it sheds its exoskeleton (moults), replacing it with a larger one. Moulting occurs 4 - 8 times, and stops when the insect has attained 'adult' size. \n\nThe adults may be wingless workers, wingless soldiers or winged or wingless reproductive adults. Winged reproductive adults are what we commonly see swarming about on rainy summer nights - they are called 'alates'.\n\nTermite development (incomplete metamorphosis) contrasts with the more common insect development we are familiar with (viz. complete metamorphosis) se seen in butterflies. \n\n1: eggs > 2:larva > 3:pupa > 4: adult\n\n---\nYou can learn a bit more about termites here:\nhttp://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/2000/2092.html",3858

How can the head of what was an officially athiest state (and it was despite what others posted) be theist?\nAlthough Hitler was born Catholic, his beliefs were definately not Christian (ie: Christ was Aryan and fought the Jews; Aryan's evolved from Adam and Eve, and everyone else evolved naturally, etc...).  He may not have been athiest, but he certainly wasn't Christian.  Jadwiga Biskupska, who wrote ""Hitler & Triumph of the Will: A Nazi Religion in the Catholic Style"" in Undergraduate Quarterly, September/November 2004, even states: ""...he ridicules the teachings of Church fathers and the practice of the Catholic faith... he detested the doctrines, of the Roman Church...

They served a search warrant in a rough neighborhood and after entering the home and announcing their presence, they were shot at by the woman...who was most likely terrified and confused by the whole thing.  Three of the officers were wounded by the woman and the officers returned fire, which did kill the woman.  It's a horrible situation and there won't be much good to come out of it.  The woman's family is devastated and the officers involved must be feeling conflicted about the whole thing.  The one good thing that might come out of this is that more care will be taken in obtaining no-knock search warrants and raids will be better planned.\n\nIt's a horribly sad situatuion but the term ""murder"" does not appear to apply here becuase there is no information (at this point) that the officers went to the home with the intent of killing this woman.  It was an awful set of circumstances that had one of the worst outcomes imaginable and it is truly pathetic, but it is NOT murder.  The investigation may reveal that the officers were negligent in planning the raid or didn't do a good job in getting the search warrant...which contributes to the unfortunate circumstances but still does not make the case for murder.",3865

1,"why are energy levels assigned negative values? ; I am refering to Bohr's theroem of hydrogen. He used a formula involving the ""Rydberg constant"". My question is why are energy levels assigned negative values  is it because the negative sign says that the energy is giving off to the surroundings? or is it because the negative sign signifying that the energy of the electron in the atom is lower than the energy of a free electron? Thanks for helping ; Negative energy can refer to several concepts:\n\n    * Negative rest energy, which corresponds to negative mass, which has many unusual physical consequences.\n    * Energy in any system below the conventionally-defined ground state. Examples are positrons under the dirac sea model of electron behavior, and the region of reduced vacuum energy associated with the Casimir effect. This type of effect typically occurs under exotic or unexpected conditions, as the definition of the ground state is usually chosen because it is the state of lowest expected energy within a system.\n    * Energy in any system below an arbitrarily defined zero level. Examples include electron potential energy within an atom under the Bohr model of atomic structure, and gravitational potential energy in Newton's model of gravity.",3884

9,"Who the hell do the Russians think they are coming over here and poisoning whoever they like? it is terrorism? ; And they should be treated as terrorists. ; Terrorism is usually ideology driven and fueled by poisonous interpretation of religion. How far this crosses the line from internal issues of the ex-soviet bloc or remains independent to soviet mobster intrigue remains a grey area.\n\nMilitary junta and remnants of the Cold War were part alienated by Western democratic states who abed out of respect to the sovereignty of a nation state, in the hope that the machine de party nationale disintegrates or degenerates. Evolution through corporatisation under hands of unscrupulous and unprincipled organisations, has allowed unchecked violence to precipitate beyond the borders of the ex-C.C.C.P. (U.S.S.R.). \n\nAt face value, the methods of the post-cold war communist government places hard currency into hands of disenchanted and poor people that served the polit buro. Rent-a-kill advertisements as recalled in local Russian papers and periodicals(1), whilst not driving these trades underground, serves to validate a flourishing industry and a means to put food on the table. Russian “entrepreneurial Moguls” under the Capitalist pretext, employs methods reminiscent of the removal of the last Tsar and the Bolsheviks, except in a corporatised form and not easily traced back.\n\nIn the very least, the ex-soviet bloc should take responsibility of the fights spilling out of their backyard. This is simply without Honour; the old spies were for mother Russia. Does the new cohort of intelligence have the slightest inkling of word; or it goes to the highest bidder without principles ?\n\nNot so long along, a special investigative unit of the Iraqi police closed down offices of “Al-Mustaqillah” newspaper in July and arrested the newspaper's office manager. According to a press release posted on the Coalition Provisional Authority (http://www.cpa-iraq.org), Al-Mustaqillah published on 13 July executed an inciteful [sic] article entitled “Death to all spies and those who cooperate with the U.S.; killing them is religious duty.”\n\nIn Ian Fleming's novel, Goldfinger is suspected of being the paymaster of Smersh and in instituting “Smiert Spionen”, death to all spies. The Soviet counterintelligence operation in reality assassinated people who fought against communism, openly and covertly.\n\nA knee jerk reaction of the democratic states would be to institute “Death to all ex-Soviet Spies” to curtail what appears to be the whispers of the snake’s offspring. Similarly, another popular call could be envisaged in the form of a moratorium on application of the death penalty should be instituted. Yet these measures do not curb the source of the illness: What is the source ?\n\nA contention is that the social-economics of communism is very much alive. The people need food, heating and jobs, but certainly not at the cost and through validation by mafia’s corporatised military (war between the oligarchs) and what appears to be old methods brought to bear on Putin’s Russia. \n\nThe ugly truth may be that a snake is required to poison a snake. Putin placed some very talented and good men to clean up the banking institutions rife with ill gotten gains, only to be gunned down no less. It ventures that more protection of key players that are pro-society are required, not less. \n\nNeedless to say, the demand for violence must be nipped with multi-tiered approach that allows the average man in Russia to live, mindful that the aegis of communist privileges no longer serves to feed, clothe and house these people. \n\nOne can only ponder the effects of Glasnost and perhaps also Perestroika, if U.S.S.R. had more goodwill, humbleness and humility to accept foreign assistance in their political transition. Even now, may not be too late.\n\nThe papers “Whatever the future holds for British energy supplies, this country must not be a safe haven for international thuggery.”",3891

2,"What to eat post gall bladder surgery.........(HELP!)? ; After just having my gall bladder removed I am finding that what ever I eat causes stomach upset and I was hoping that others who have gone down this path would share what worked for them.\n\nIt was an emergency surgery on March 9th/06. I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

It has always been okay for an older guy to date a younger girl,  but when the girl dates the younger guy, she is laughed at and jokes made.\nI wouldn't let it bother you.  I would proudly say, ""And he's a year younger than me, hope I can still get a young one when I'm 80"".  \nAge shouldn't matter, to answer your question.  All that matters is that you are right for each other for however long it lasts.  If you get along, then to heck with what your friends say or how loud they laugh.  if they are really your friends, they'll accept it and have compassion and understanding and not mock you or put you down.  To joke when you gals are alone, well jokes, alone, that's okay.  But to gossip or hurt your feelings, their not friends and never really were.\nGo with your heart and forget what others will say.  The true challenge is finding out in the long run if those friends you thought were friends really were to begin with.\nControl your own life, don't let others control you.\nMany a marriage has lasted eternally with a large age difference and that also includes dating relationships.  My girlfriend is married to a guy that is nearly 15 years younger than her.  They are and have been for over 17 years, a perfect coupld.\nGo for it.................",4011

I think you should try the relationship, the trick is to just keep your relationship and your job seperate, while at work your relationship is not open for discussion, maintain a professional attitude in the work place, and don't allow your relationship to come into play. Also make sure she has the same attitude, and when work hours are over everything should work out just how you want it to.

5,"help in basketball? ; what kind of excersises can i do when i am not playing basketball or near a basketball court.. to help my left hand (im right handed, shoot with left hand, and dribble best with right hand) become better at shooting,dribbbling,layups, etc....also how can i improve ball handling skills on both and/or left and right hands? ; For dribbling, make it a point to dribble most of the time or at least give equal time to dribbling with your weak hand.  Work at dribbling the ball in figure 8's around your legs.  Dribble around cones, dribble baselines at a run getting your speed down pat.  Then dribble backing up against a defender or driving to the hoop against a defender.  If you are driving on the left side of the basket it is best to use your left hand if you can, that way your body is between the defender and the ball.  Same goes for the right side, on the right side dribble with your right hand to keep your body between the defender and the ball.  Another good thing to do when dribbling against a defender is to watch their waist, not their feet.  The waist is where the person's center of balance is.  Where their waist goes, that is where their body is going to go.  You don't necessarily have to keep your eyes on the person's waist.  You can use your free hand as your eyes.  Use your free hand to feel where the person is.  Feel whether they are moving left or moving right by placing your free hand against their waist.  Just make sure you don't use your free hand to hold them by wrapping it around them or to push off.  \n\nDon't keep your eye on the basketball, keep your eyes looking around you and on your defender.  You should be able to dribble the ball without looking at it.  So keep your head up.\n\nTo help improve your dribbling more, some coaches will have a player wear thick clumbsy gloves.  If you can get good with thick gloves on, then it makes it all that much easier when you take the gloves off.  Coaches will also use gloves for training players to catch and pass the ball.\n\nAs far as shooting, watch how much arch you give the ball.  The more arch you give the ball the better chance you have of it going in, especially if you are farther out.  Make sure to bring the ball to eye level before you shoot and keep your eyes focused on the hoop even after you let go of the ball.  When you release the ball, you want both hands to fall down like a wet limp rag.  This helps ensure that the ball doesn't stray left or right.\n\nI like to do a drill where I start out at the base of the basket 1-2 ft away and work my way out to the 3 point line.  I'll take a shot from the left side, then take a shot from the right side or work my way around the hoop in a semicircle then work my way away from the hoop.  I try taking the shots somewhat fast because you aren't going to have a lot of time to shoot them in a game.  Also this keeps you running building endurance at the same time.  By moving from short shots to long shots it helps improve both your short shots and long shots.  It also helps you gauge how much power you have to put behind your shot to hit the long shots.  If you notice you are falling short on your long shots move in a little closer if you are tired or if you aren't tired, put a little more mmph behind them.  If you are overshooting move back a little or reduce the amount of power you give it.\n\nI mentioned earlier about arch increasing your percentage of making a basket.  There is such a thing as giving too much arch to a ball.  By that I mean, the more arch you give to a ball, the more energy it requires from you to shoot it which can tire you out over the length of a game.  To accomodate that, you have to find a good middle ground for the amount of arch you give the ball.  Enough so you make the shot most the time, but not so much that it makes you tired and miss or the ball falls short.\n\nAlso, dont' be afraid to drive to the hoop, if you see the opening, go for it.  You have to be confident in your abilities.  At the same time, don't be a ball hog.  Make sure you pass the ball to players you see that could have an open shot or an open lane to drive to the hoop.  Basketball is a team sport and Bobby Knight didn't have his teams pass it 4-5 times before shooting for nothing.  Although I&#3",4101

That is the law of justice, where the punishment must equal the crime.  How does eternal hell fit into this vision of justice?  If I spend 1 second gossiping, should I have to suffer a gazillion billion decades of the worst imaginable torture for that?  How is that just?  \n\nJesus is said to have suffered all the torture we deserved.  Yet he only suffered for a finite time.  But supposedly, we deserve an infinite amount of punishment for all the sins we commit.  How is that understandable? ; But your sin isn't finite, because it's a sin against God's holy standard.  He set the way things are to be, if you do something contrary to that, you've sinned against God, not a finite being.  I saw an article that said if you slap a foreign dignitary or someone in authority, that is a worse offense than slapping joe blow down the street.  Both slaps took the same time to commit, but one is a greater transgression.  So it is with God, only God's nature is infinite, so wouldn't that make the sin infinite?  If the sin is infinite, so the punishment must be.  \n\nJesus suffered an finite amount of time, but he was an infinite being (Christians believe Jesus was God).  So his sacrifice was infinite to atone for our sins that were infinite.  I'm not really well versed in the theology of this, but basic Christian teaching is that the only one who could atone for our sins was an infinite being, thats why it's wrong for a Christian to teach that Jesus was not God, but that he atoned for our sins.  Logically, it would be impossible.\n\nIf you want, email me, and I can ask my pastor, he has a Ph.D in philosophy and is a Christian.  I realize you may not agree with what he has to say, but in any case, you could hear a logical answer to your question to better understand what Christians believe.",4118

6,"How do people earn big money making jewelry? ; My sister makes beautiful jewelry, but she only gets $10 - $25 a piece at craft fairs.  I have seen jewelry that looks just like hers in an art gallery asking $l,000 or more. ; First off it all depends on how you market your jewelry. If you want to sell this for $1,000 or more you need to make your customers precieve that kind of value on your product. \n\nFirst if you know that your jewelry is one of a kind you need to show that it does. Your own style and label. Labeling your jewelry is your name to fame. Especially the ones you see in the art galleries. Make your jewelry unique, creative, your style, your design. Make your name as a Brand. Market your name as a Brand. So when people hear your name they know it's your jewelry.\n\nExample: When you say McDonald's...people think of Big Mac\n\nI'm gonna give you a tip that I learned from my father he used to buy old cars and resold the car himself. This is what he used to do to get more money for his car. He used to place flyers in local stores sending customers to my brother's house, to see the car for a high price, which didn't say how much the price of the car this flyer states that we accept any offers. Then in a few days later he place another ad which sent customer's to his house, which this flyer has a lower price on the same car advertise.  So in the end he was selling his car for more, but price was cheaper than from my brother's house. Without Negotiating any pricing on the car.\n\nKnow you can use the same system to resell your jewelry. For example you can set up a website selling it for really high. And you can set up an account on Ebay where your going to sell it for less. Now remember whatever price you sell on your website your going to sell it on Ebay for 1/2 of the price.\n\nYou can also create a blog about jewelry art. And you can talk about your designs. This will increase your Branding.\n\nGood Luck and I hope this will help you in your jewelry business venture.\n\nLuis Galarza,  Business and Telecommunication Consultant\nfor communication tips go to http://www.cogni360blog.co.nr\nand for free business tips go to http://luisgalarza.blogspot.com",4131

5,"i need to know some  stunts? ; I am a coach for a 75lb cheerleading squad and i need to know some stunts for my squad,also how to start a basket toss we need it for the competition ; The above way is one way to do it.  One of our flyers is about 90 pounds, and we figured out an easier way to get more height out of her basket toss.  The two bases each grab their left wrist to make a right angle, and then grab the other bases wrist, to make a square.  The front spot holds underneath the hands, just like in a normal basket toss.  Now, the backspot counts off, 1, 2 - on 2, the backspot puts the flyer in the ""basket"" and the flyer stays their until ready to ""fire"".  Flyer should have their hands on the bases shoulders, elbows out, and shoulders square.  The backspot then grabs the back of the flyers ankles and counts off 1,2 - on two, everyone bounces once, and then throws the flyer in the air.  This gets more height because it allows the flyer to push off better instead of relying on the bases to throw her up in the air right away.\n\nEasy stunts for small girls could include small pyramids or small lifts without a backspot.  Take two bases and a flyer.  Set up one base in a pocket (deep lunge) and another across from her in a prep stance (bent knees, straight back, hands together with palms facing up.)  With both hands on the bases shoulders, the flyer sets one foot in the pocket and bounces into the other bases prep stance.  The base with the prep stance lifts and turns the flyers foot so the the base is now perpendicular with the pocket base and the the flyer now has one foot down in the pocket and one foot up in a prep sideways.  This looks good is you have two of them facing opposite directions.",4167

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

Relationships are about two people and their feelings. For example, I have two friends that are swingers...it's totally acceptable for one to pick someone up and snog them without asking the other. They are cool with that... am I? Heck no! My point? You need to sit down with your partner and establish boundaries. They can be conservative, they can be liberal and you don't need statistics to tell you you're right. You only need to make sure it's something both of you can live with. You both must compromise on this one. For example, maybe your partner feels you are unreasonable about your level of social interaction. IE you don't like having people over enough, while he/she would love it if people were over all day long everyday. Maybe the compromise is setting up limits, like ok Monday and Wed nights are open and you can have people over but the other nights you need to ask...or maybe, as soon as you are aware someone is coming over, please let me know. Or maybe its a matter of establishing hours or something. Point is, you need to be able to find a happy medium. If you can't there might be deeper issues you need to look into resolving.

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

If someone were to be stereotyped as emo, they would generally keep to themselves, be more timid than others, and not really want to do anything about it.  The majority of kids who fit this stereotype generally like to listen to music.  They feel it helps them escape the stresses of reality.  Music has essentially become their anti-drug.

Evanescence's upcoming release, THE OPEN DOOR, will be in stores on Oct, 3. 2006!\n\nFollowing the multi-platinum, worldwide success of FALLEN, THE OPEN DOOR is an ideal showcase for the band's inevitable personal and professional growth, with songs of introspection, longing, doubt, self-respect and ultimately, empowerment and anticipation.\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles at The Record Plant with long-time friend and producer Dave Fortman, the album is defined by Amy Lee's beautiful melodies, profound lyrics, stunning vocals and poignant piano, which fuse with Terry Balsamo's urgent, yet intricate guitar playing, to form a remarkable, ethereal blend perfectly rooted in the band's rock and classical sensibilities.\n\nAmy Lee shared some thoughts about the upcoming release:\n\n""The making of this record has been really intense, but I've come out feeling purified. I've grown so much since 'Fallen,' and Terry is the perfect writing partner -- I feel like I've been lifted up to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities.

1,"Please tell me what we did wrong with this proof.  The question is:Let a,b and c be integers such that c.....? ; divides a*b. Then either c divides a or c divides b.\nFirst, we tried a bunch of examples, like when c=3 and ab=27, so a =3 and b=9, and you see that c divides a and c divides b.  Or another one is when c=7 and ab=56, so a=7 and b=8, and we know that 7 divides 56 and also 7 divides 7. Also, if c=12 and a=5 and b=24, then ab=120, and you see that c divides 120, and slo c divides b, which is all we need because the conjecture is an ""or"" statement so we only need one of the conditions to be true.  So we decided that the conjecture is true. Proof: Let a,band c be integers. We will prove the conjecture by contrapositive. So we assume that c doesn't divide a and that c doesn't divide b. We will show that c doesn't divide a*b. Since c doesn't dived a, then we know that a doesn't = c*m. Also, c doesn't divide b, so we know that b doesn't = s*n. So ab doesn't = (cm)(cn)=c(cmn). Now, cmn is an integer q(since c,m and n are all integers).Thus ab doesn't = cq for any int q. So c doesn't divide ab. ; Well, the basic problem you've run into is that the conjecture isn't true.  If a = 6, b = 3, and c = 9, then a*b = 18, and 18/9 = 2, but neither 6 nor 3 is divisible by 9.\n\nTo prove that something is true you must prove it is true for all possible values of the variables, in this case a, b, and c.  However, to prove something is false, you need only supply a single counter-example.  Thus the above example disproves the conjecture that for all integers a, b, and c if a*b is divisible by c then a or b is also divisible by c.\n\nNote that a ≠ cm and b ≠ cn does not imply that ab ≠ c(cmn).  For example, if a = 6, b = 8, c = 2, m = 4, and n = 3, then cm = 2*3 = 8 ≠6 so cm ≠ a, and cn = 2 * 3 = 6 ≠ 8 so cn ≠ b.  However, (cm)(cn) = 2 * 4 * 2 * 3 = 48, and a * b = 6 * 8 = 48, so ab = (cm)(cn).  This proves that you cannot multiply not-equalities (i.e. statements with ""doesn't equal).\n\nAlso, concluding that if c does not divide a or b implies that c does not divide ab is not the same as concluding that if c does divide ab it must also divide a or b.  This logical fallacy is equivalent to the statement that for all plants, not a tree implies not a rock, so being a rock implies being a tree.  The first statement is true: all plants that are not trees are also not rocks.  However, the second statement is clearly false, as no rocks are also trees.",4219

Can anyone explain this deeper? ; That's a bit of an exaggeration.  Early rock-and-roll drew from the blues, but also from R&B and country music.  When hard rock developed in the mid-'60s, it was based almost exclusively on the blues.  Artists like the Rolling Stones (""Little Red Rooster"" is an especially good example), Cream/Eric Clapton (""Sunshine of Your Love""), and Jimi Hendrix, (""Hey Joe""), built the foundation for hard rock, and the heavy metal that developed out of it, on an exaggerated electric blues.  Though the more sophisticated hard-rock and metal bands of the seventies incorporated other influences (British folk for Led Zeppelin, jazz for Led Zeppelin), most, like Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, continued to build on the blues base.  While subsequent rock artists have drawn on influences as diverse as free-jazz and avant-garde strains of 20th century classical, especially in more underground and experimental veins, mainstream rock music has never stopped drawing on the blues, passed along from one generation to the next.",4256

South Korea lost many chance to get the goal because of the UMPIRE.   GAME IS GAME...IT SHOULD BE  FAIR AND UNDERSTANDABLE TO EVERYONE..   One person SHOWED offside flag..The other person said not...The players already saw the first sign...   The cheif umpire didn't want to give any chances to Korea team as well...   Korea lost many chances  by UMPIRE...\nAlso he took the ball from Korea players.....Isn't that funny..? ; The assistant referee can be ruled out by the main referee at any time. The referee made an excellent decision by letting the goal stand and not calling an offside especially after you see in the replay that the ball deflected by the south korean player, even if Frei was offside. Being offside is not disallowed in such a situation. The referee had an excellent eye when he saw the deflected pass. What is truly unbelievable is how all the South Korean players STOPPED playing when they saw the sign!!! That was a huge mistake. No one should stop playing until the ref blows his whistle! That is why you see attackers never stop even if they see the sign, until the referee blows the whistle. The South Koreans should learn a lesson from this.",4280

2,"I have a problem when I do any physical exercise I tend to fart a lot and sometimes I follow....? ; through with a tiny bit of excrement.  Is this normal? ; This happens to me sometimes.. it could be the sign of a high-fiber diet and your body's struggling to metabolize food at the rate at which you're using energy.  Digestion of food produces waste gases.  For example, yesterday I got on my bicycle and rode almost 60 miles.. halfway during the exercise, the farting started, and now today it's still happening.. my body may not have yet caught up with refueling the 3000 calories I burned.\nThe excrement might be caused by what you're eating.

Which Processer will work on the PGA 370 socket that will be big enough to run XP OS? ; And you won't find a new processor that fits it either.  The current Pentium 4/Pentium D processors use the LGA 775 socket.  But I don't like Intel processors anyway.  I like AMD and that wold be socket 939 for a good number of them.  If you're serious about upgrading you're going to have to get a new motherboard to fit the processor of your choice.  However, depending on the speed of the PIII you may be able to run XP if it is faster than say 700MHz but don't expect it to be a speeding bullet.  Not to mention that you'll need a minimum of 256MB of memory (I like having at least 512MB) but I won't touch a system that has less than 1GB.

Your mom is probably concerned b/c of your irregular periods and abdominal pain.  This could mean cysts or endometriosis. Which is treatable.  It is good to go to the gyno b/c they can answer questions and help you with your problem.  A gynocologist is a professional-that person is not there to hurt you!!  She is there to help you and answer ques.  She will talk to you, give you a breast exam (and show you how to give y/self a breast exam), she will lubricate her fingers and feel of your ovaries to make sure there are no cysts.  She will put a speculum into your vagina( it is metal and sorta cold).  This will take samples of your bacteria to make sure that there is nothing to worry about.  Your mother does not have to be in there and the gyno will be the only that can view your genitals.  Which they see everyday.  This will allow you to overcome some of your anxiety so that when you get older you will not be so overwhelmed.  Your mother may want to know if you are sexually active and the doc cannot say anything to your mother.  Talk with your mother and ask her the reason why she wants you to go.

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

First off, more likely then not, other people have found the same drop shippers, and eBay will be flooded with that merchandise. \n\nSecondly, a lot of the companies are not reliable at all. So if you go with one, be prepared for your customers to be writing/calling you and asking why their item has not been shipped to them.\n\nThirdly, the above mentioned will kill your feedback rating, and if you ever need help in one of the forums, the regular sellers will tell you to scratch.\n\nTake a look for yourself, and see why it's not the best of ideas:\n\neBay> Community> Discussion Boards> Seller Central\n\nJust do a search for past discussions on dropshippers and you will see what I mean.",4339

It is usually seen on the upper arms and thighs and manifests as reddish bumps or ""chicken skin.""  Use a strong alpha-hydroxy acid twice daily.  Over the counter available is Lac-Hydrin 5 which is 5% AHA.  The doctor can prescribe Lac-Hydrin 12% which is more effective.  Be careful of the other available alpha-hydroxy acids out there as they may have too high of a pH to be effective.  Increasing the consumption of omega 3 fatty acids such as those found in salmon and cold-water fish and increasing the dietary intake of gamma-linolinic acid can also help smooth the skin. Take Borage seed oil (found in health food stores) twice a day or per bottle instructions.  You should start to see smoother skin in about 3-6 months.",4345

Not a quid pro quo but access.

Such people are going to be necessary to the modern world of clashing religious groups.\n\nBut if you start with the academic study, and you continue to feel it is appropriate for you, then phone a local Muslim organization and ask them what to do.  Accept that they may be suspicious of you for a while; things are tense in the religious world between Muslims and the mostly Christian world.  They see white skin, they may think spy.  Be patient and friendly, and not too pushy, and I'm sure they will recognize your sincerity eventually.  A strong academic background will give you something you can talk about with them, and they will respect your scholarship.  The Arab world generally sees scholarship as something they want for themselves, but they do it their way, of course.",4426

Corrosive substances, such as cleaning solutions, can erode the esophagus if they are swallowed accidentally or deliberately, as in a suicide attempt. Some pills (for example, aspirinSome Trade Names\nECOTRIN\nASPERGUM\nor other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], alendronateSome Trade Names\nFOSAMAX\n, doxycyclineSome Trade Names\nVIBRAMYCIN\n, and certain large iron and potassium tablets) can cause painful erosions if they lodge temporarily in the esophagus.\n\nDiagnosis of erosive esophagitis is made by esophagoscopy. If an erosion results from a pill, the pill usually can be washed down with large quantities of water; the pain often resolves within hours. Rarely, erosions caused by corrosive substances or pills persist, leading to narrowing of the esophagus.",4445

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

1,"What is a derivative? antiderivative? ; THANX!! ; Derivative of a function is the study of microscopic and complex rate of change or infinitesimal rate of change of a curve, a process, a phenomena etc.Several changes have been taking place in this world,a macroscopic changes and uniform changes are easily countable, but complex changes are not easily accountable.To understand such changes we require the wonderful mathematical tool  called drivative, diffrentiation, diffrential etc.For example think of pouring  water into a conical vessel in drops.Here if the drops that are dripping in are uniform, it is easy to know the number of drops per minute, per hour etc.But it very difficult to find the rate of change of height of water  as the water drips in to the container (conical) and the corresponding rate of change of surface area of the water in the container.To understand such changes we move towards zero or towards a number which we call as the limit.Also a prosses may be a chemical reaction, in physics it may be a free fall of an object or an acclerated body.Moreover, consider y=x^2, the derivative of this is dy/dx = 2x, here change is not uniform as common difference in an arithmetic progression.\nWhen x=4 & 5 we have x^2= 16 & 25 ; then the difference is 9.Compare this 9 with the derivative 2x = 2*4 & 2*5 = 8 & 10.These numbers 1 more or less to 9.Of course the difference 1 is considerable when x is a small number. When x is sufficiently large this 1 becomes negligible.ie. limit as x tends to infinity the derivative of x^2 is 2x.  \nAnti-derivative is opposite to this concept. This is usually called as integration, summation, premitive etc. Here it is the study of complex accumulation.\nFor example when a point is accumulated in a single direction without break we call it a line, ie. when a point dx is integrated we get a line `x'.When line is intigrated we get a surface, that is x^2 /2. When the same is revesed we get a point . former is called integration later is called diffrentiation.",4481

And what perplexes me is that we're allowed to carry bear spray in bear country, but not allowed to carry mace in predatory lunatic country, which can be just about anywhere, even in the most tranquil of suburbs. ; Before you get over worked over this issue, you need to know some facts.\n\nMace has limited ability in stopping attackers and some people are not in the least affected by it. Pepper spray is much more effective, but also has problems.\n\nMost people (non-police) who carry the stuff are not trained when and how to use it and are depending on it for their front line of defense. They also will tend to get in to a bit of a panic if attacked, grab it and spray. If the wind is in the wrong direction, the mace/pepper spray may blow back on them, leaving the assailant untouched. It can also be very difficult to incapacitate a person who is very drunk and/or on drugs. The small cans of spray can also leak over time and not work when you really need it.\n\nConsider also, since mace/pepper spray is legal, the bad guys/gals can get it too and can easily get you before you get them.\n\nThere are many effective means of self defense, if one takes the time to learn the methods, that can give you a chance to get out of a confrontation.

9,"Question about the War on Terror? ; Every front on the War on Terror, both abroad and here at home, seems to ask one simple question: how far are we, as a country, willing to go to win the war? I think that as long as we hold back, there will always be places the enemy can go where we can't follow, places they can hide where we can't look, and things they can do that we can't stop. So, just how far should we take this thing? Where, if anywhere, should we draw the line? Would drawing the line anywhere be worth the possible loss of more American lives? ; I think we are unchartered waters on this one.  We have never fought an enemy of this nature before so where to draw the line and how far to take it will depend on the world's willingness to stop the terror attacks.  As we saw with Spain, not all countries view this war the same.  But, unless there is a concerted effort on the part of all governments that value freedom to destroy the terrorists throughout the world we will never end this.  Afghanistan and Iraq are the tip of the iceberg.  The Islamic terrorists, and make no mistake that that is who this war is directed at, have the ability to travel all over the world and use the tools of cowards to continue their jihad.  Since we are not fighting a standing army, and I doubt that our estimates of people involved in terrorist oganizations is close to accurate, we cannot know when we ""get them all"".  The ultimate solution will have to come from a coalition of world governments being willing to root out these organizations on their soil and drive them into a corner where they are considered, and please forgive the use of the term, lepers.  Once they are seen as un-touchable (in that no one wants to touch them or allow them safe haven) then we can talk about drawing lines.",4507

Many of the \nproblems of estrogen dominance, including fluid retention, \ndepression, headaches, and urinary tract infections, are experienced \nby women using birth control pills. Everything we’ve said about the \nnegative effects for menopausal women of using progestins applies to \nthe progestins used in birth control pills. Having altered your \nnormal hormonal cycles when using the Pill, you are more prone to \nsymptoms at midlife as well as potentially more serious health problems. \nThis is because the synthetic estrogens and progestins used in the \nPill can interfere with the body’s own progesterone receptors.

9,"Is it legal to import prescription drugs from Canada into the U.S. ? ; (sorry I wasn't specific enough in my previous post) ; Here is the official position of Food and Drug Administration  answering your question.\n\nThe United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. sections 331(d), and 355(a)), which is administered by FDA, prohibits the interstate shipment (which includes importation) of unapproved new drugs. Unapproved new drugs are any drugs, including foreign-made versions of U.S. approved drugs, that have not received FDA approval to demonstrate they meet the federal requirements for safety and effectiveness. It is the importer's obligation to demonstrate to FDA that any drugs offered for importation have been approved by FDA.\n\nFDA has developed guidance entitled ""Coverage of Personal Importations"" which sets forth that agency's enforcement priorities with respect to the personal importation of unapproved new drugs by individuals for their personal use. The guidance identifies circumstances in which FDA may consider exercising enforcement discretion and refrain from taking legal action against illegally imported drugs. Those circumstances are as follows:\n\n""1) the intended use [of the drug] is unapproved and for a serious condition for which effective treatment may not be available domestically either through commercial or clinical means; \n\n2) there is no known commercialization or promotion to persons residing in the U.S. by those involved in the distribution of the product at issue; \n\n3) the product is considered not to represent an unreasonable risk; \n\nand \n\n4) the individual seeking to import the product affirms in writing that it is for the patient's own use (generally not more than a 3 month supply) and provides the name and address of the doctor licensed in the U.S. responsible for his or her treatment with the product, or provides evidence that the product is for the continuation of a treatment begun in a foreign country."" (Emphasis added)\n\nFDA's guidance is not, however, a license for individuals to import unapproved (and therefore illegal) drugs for personal use into the U.S. Even if all of the factors noted in the guidance are present, the drugs remain illegal and FDA may decide that such drugs should be refused entry or seized. The guidance represents FDA's current thinking regarding the issues of personal importation and is intended only to provide operating guidance for FDA personnel. The guidance does not create any legally enforceable rights for the public; nor does it operate to bind FDA or the public. \n\nTo avoid travel delays and to prevent possible harm from taking unsafe or ineffective medications, residents and visitors upon arrival to or departure from the U.S. should keep in mind the following precautions:\n\nDo not assume that medications which are legal in foreign countries are also approved for use in the United States. These products may be illegal and may include addictive and dangerous substances;\n \n\nBe aware that the labeled uses (conditions for which the product is represented to be effective) for a product purchased outside the U.S. may not be approved in the United States;\n \nIt can be dangerous to take some medications without medical supervision. The reason why some medications are limited to prescription use in the United States is that either they are unsafe without medical supervision or a medical diagnosis is required to ensure that the medication is appropriate for your condition;\n \nAvoid purchasing any drug products that are not approved for sale in the U.S. (including foreign-manufactured versions of U.S. approved drugs). FDA cannot assure that these products conform to the manufacturing and quality assurance procedures mandated by U.S. laws and regulations and, therefore, these products may be unsafe. In addition, such products are illegal in the U.S. and, therefore, may be subject to entry refusal;\n \nSome medications which may appear to be U.S. approved drug products may in fact be counterfeit versions of such products.

Eating out? ; I'm a little bit sick of cooking for myself :) I'm on holidays and would like to just once be able to go out to a restaurant with my partner and order something I know won't make me sick (that isn't plain boiled rice). Any ideas? ; 1. as far as your gall bladder problem, several studies have shown that fatty meals may not play as much of a role in the colicky type of pain associated with either stones or a malfunctioning gall bladder, however all the patients I treat and including myself who has what is called ""cholelithiasis"" find that certain meals will set off an attack. It is probably a good idea when you eat to have several small meals per day rather than the traditional three meals. Smaller portions throughout the day may help with your gall bladder pains.\n2. Now for your diagnosis of IBS. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion which means you must rule out other more ominous causes, ie. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis both can be detected with a colonoscopy. Additionally, you should be tested for what is called ""gluten sensitivity"" and ""celiac sprue"". There are blood tests that can shed light on these disorders such as a test called ""gliadin antibodies"". Your GI doctor may also want to take some biopsies of your colon during the colonscopy so a Pathologist can microscopically determine what type if any inflammation is going on and what the mucosal lining of the intestine looks like. Flattening of the mucosa may be indicative of some of the diseases I mentioned previously. \n3. When you go out to eat, the problem is that if you are allergic to peanuts, many times they will cook with peanut oil and there may even be remnants of peanuts or the oil in preparing your food. This can be very dangerous. I had a patient several years ago who was allergic to peanuts and ate out at McDonalds I believe and there were trace amounts of peanuts or peanut oil which threw him into anaphylactic shock; thank goodness he survived. So you have to be very very careful and let the restaurant know that you are allergic to peanuts, oils, or any by product of peanuts. \nI hope this helps you. You should speak to a Gastroenterologist and have a colonoscopy and some blood work to check for the antibodies. Gluten sensitivity usually goes hand in hand with wheat allergies. There are newer medications that will help with irritable bowel syndrome. Zelnorm is the one that comes to mind. For some reason when it first came to market it was only for women, I assume because most cases of IBS are in females, but more recent studies show that it can be effective in relieving the symptoms of IBS in men too.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",4564

1,"What are the economic and environmental considerations of materials? ; For materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, and composites. ; Economic Considerations\n\nResearch has shown that if the soil test is below the desired level, application of phosphorus will provide yield increases that will not only pay for the treatment, but also provide additional income beyond the cost of the treatment. If the soil test is above the cut-off point, i.e. more than 20 pounds above the desired level, it will be in the best interest of the farmer to invest his capital in inputs other than phosphorus as such an addition will not result in a yield increase.\n\nLand tenure and/or availability of capital also affect the economic rate of application. For those individuals that have limited or unknown tenure, or limited capital, it is suggested that they extend the build-up period from the recommended 4 year period to 6 years or in some cases longer. Other than for the most deficient soils, this will not have an adverse impact on yield.\nEnvironmental Considerations:\n\nThere is no documented evidence that excess phosphorus in water supplies creates a human health hazard. Rather, when phosphorus enters surface waters in substantial concentration, it becomes a pollutant by contributing to excessive growth of algae and other aquatic plants, and, thus to accelerated eutrophication of surface waters.\n\nEutrophication is the process where through nutrient enrichment of surface waters, algae and other aquatic plant growth is increased. This associated increase in aquatic plant growth and their ultimate decomposition limits the use of surface waters for recreation, fisheries, industry, and drinking. In most water bodies, phosphorus is the element most limiting for plant growth. When critical concentrations of phosphorus are exceeded by environmental pollution, eutrophication occurs. The critical concentration of phosphorus for eutrophication that is frequently cited is 0.01 parts per million (ppm).\n\nPhosphorus contamination of surface waters comes from point source emissions (industry and waste water from sewage treatment systems) and non-point sources with agriculture being the primary non-point source. Over the last couple of decades, point source contamination has been markedly decreased. As a result, agriculture has been designated as the primary source of phosphorus entering surface waters. The primary mechanisms by which agriculture contributes phosphorus to surface water is through runoff and erosion. Movement of phosphorus through tile does occur on sandy and organic soils and through macropores of fine textured soils. Studies in the U.S. have found very low concentrations of dissolved phosphorus in tile line effluents, but frequently they exceed a projected critical value of 0.01 ppm phosphorus. If the sorption capacity of the profile of a fine textured soil were to become phosphorus saturated to near the depth of tile lines, there would be a continual excessive supply of bioavailable phosphorus in that tile line outflow. If accepted agronomic practices are followed for phosphorus management, phosphorus released in tile line flow will be minimal.\n\nPhosphorus from agricultural sources enters the stream as either dissolved phosphorus or particulate phosphorus. Dissolved phosphorus is comprised mostly of orthophosphate which is immediately available for uptake by algae. Particulate phosphorus is attached to soil and organic matter particles and as such is not immediately available for plant use. The fate of particulate phosphorus is dependent on the characteristics of the receiving water body. If the existing sediment is low in phosphorus, a portion of the dissolved phosphorus may be sorbed to the sediment. However, if the sediment entering the water body is high in particulate phosphorus, a portion of it may be desorbed into dissolved phosphorus over a prolonged period of time.\n\nThere are several factors that influence the rate of movement of phosphorus from agricultural lands. These include inherent soil phosphorus level, tillage, ground cover, rate and method of applicat",4583

1,"how are michelson's interferometers used ?(to calculate wavelength of light  etc)? ; can someone help it with diagrams ; A Michelson interferometer is like a very very sensitive ruler that measures in wavelengths of light. Visible light has a wavelength between about 400 and 800nm (10^-9 meters). Thus the distances we can measure are pretty small.\n\nThe basic operation of a Michelson interferometer is like this: You take a laser (because laser light is monochromatic and coherent), and then split the beam. We need the light to be monochromatic, that is, having only one wavelength present (633nm for a HeNe laser, common in the lab). Once split, the laser is put on two different paths, these should be at right angles to each other. They are then reflected back along the same path and recombined. If the distance in one leg was greater than that in the other leg, we'll see an interference pattern due to the different number of wavelenghts that fit along the different paths.\n\nSo it is an instrument for measuring differential length. The idea was that you could use this to look for the ""ether."" This was an idea in the early 20th century that there must be some medium for light waves to ""wave in."" By analogy, water waves are movements in the medium of water. So there should be (the thinking went) that there is an ether that carries light waves.\n\nWell, the way to test  this idea is to think about how the earth moves. If there was an ether the earth would be moving through it at some speed, in the direction that the earth is moving, we'd measure a different speed of light than in a direction at a right angle (orthogonal) to the motion of the earth. So you set up your Michelson interferometer, and see if you can get interference patterns that could only be due to the different speeds of light in different directions.\n\nThe experiments revealed that there was no such thing as an ether.",4633

3,"How many words human brain can memorize daily? ; i am talking about vocabulary. ; hundreds if you try, but normally the average person acquires 7-15 new words per day from age two onward\n\n""Several researchers have estimated comprehension vocabularies of young adults, with totals ranging from 40,000 to 100,000 for high school graduates (Nagy & Anderson, 1984; Nagy & Herman, 1987). The variation appears to be largely determined by the size of the dictionaries sampled, and to some extent by the way in which words are defined as being separate from each other and by the testing methods employed. (See Anglin, 1993, Miller, 1991, and Miller and Wakefield's commentary in Anglin, 1993, for review and critiques). The most common testing methods have been multiple choice tests much like those of TOEFL, but a few other procedures have been employed with comparable results. Here is one example of an estimation method. Moyer and Landauer (Landauer, 1986) sampled 1,000 words from Webster's Third International Dictionary (1964) and presented them to Stanford University undergraduates along with a list of 30 common categories. If a student classified a word correctly and rated it familiar it was counted as known. Landauer then went through the dictionary and guessed how many of the words could have been gotten right by knowing some other morphologically related word, and adjusted the results accordingly. The resulting estimate was around 100,000 words. This is at the high end of published estimates. A lower, frequently cited estimate is around 40,000 by the last year of high school (Nagy & Anderson, 1984). It appears, however, that all existing estimates are somewhat low because as many as 60% of the words found in a daily newspaper do not occur in dictionaries-mostly names, some quite common (Walker & Amsler, 1986)-and most have not adequately counted conventionalized multi-word idioms whose meanings cannot be derived from their components.\n\nBy simple division, knowing 40,000 to 100,000 words by 20 years of age means adding an average of 7-15 new words a day from age two onwards. The rate of acquisition during late elementary and high school years has been estimated at between 3,000 and 5,400 words per year (10-15 per day), with some years in late elementary school showing more rapid gains than the average (Nagy & Herman, 1987; Smith, 1941). In summary, it seems safe to assume that, by the usual measures, the total meaning recognition vocabularies of average fifth to eighth grade students increase by somewhere between ten and fifteen new words per day.""",4668

You might not like some of the task you are doing now, but as you learn and have more experience at your workplace, your boss will be able to see that you are capable of doing the tasks given and will be more willing to give you tasks that challenge you.

I had a planned dinner for my immediate family members only.  These people just showed up about an hour into the meal.  Of course I fed everyone, however it seems to me that this was very very rude.  How should I handle this situation if it arises at another holiday, such as Christmas.  My daughter said that it was obvious to her that I was upset with them just showing up (but it must have not bothered them - they did not seem to notice).  I was hoping that my ""body language"" would give them the hint that this is not okay.  With that many children one might ask did they have food for Thanksgiving - I have to guess that they could afford food because they rented a cabin nearby for the weekend. I am very confused with how to handle this in the future.  My husband was also upset, however he would have a hard time saying anything to these people. ; I would take it as a compliment.  They obviously had no one else to spend the holiday with, whether it was by choice or not.  By their actions they seem as though they may not be the most appreciative family.  I would address it with them when it is not during a holiday or family time.  This will cause unneeded tension between the family.  Explain to them that you would not mind if they were to come over as long as it was planned and you did not get caught off guard.  Also, they may have rented a cabin but it may be all a front.

Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.

5,"facts about javelen? ; history ; Javelin throw\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nA high school athlete throwing the javelin.The javelin throw is an athletics (track and field) throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fibreglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber. Because of its potential danger, it is not always included in track and field meets; for instance, Michigan high school track and field does not include javelin.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Competition and throws \n2 Javelin redesigns \n3 History and the javelin at the Olympics \n4 World records \n5 Famous Javelin Throwers \n5.1 Women \n5.2 Men \n5.3 Top Ten longest throwers of all time (current 1986 model)- men \n \n\n\n[edit]\nCompetition and throws\nRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws or six when they are placed to the eighth position, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimeter. The javelin's point must touch the ground first for the throw to be legal. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface from which they must release the javelin. The run-up culminates in a 40 degree fan emanating from a point 8m behind the line. Throws are measured from the point of landing to the inside of the painted line with the measuring tape co-linear with the point of landing and the focal point of the fan. Javelin throwers also normally use spikes unlike other throwers, with eleven small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.\n\nJavelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more similar physical characteristics to those athletes rather than the bulky frames of the strength throwers. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 70 mph (113 km/h).\n\n[edit]\nJavelin redesigns\nIn 1986, the men's javelin (800 g) was redesigned because of the prodigious distances being thrown culminating in a world record throw of over 104m by the then East German thrower, Uwe Höhn. The javelin throw was in danger of being banished to outside the arena on safety grounds so the javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved further away from the centre of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act) so that the javelin had a downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% and also causing the javelin to stick in. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g) was similarly redesigned.\n\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.\n\n[edit]\nHistory and the javelin at the Olympics\nThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1908. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. The objective there, however was to throw at a target rather than for distance.\n\n[edit]\nWorld records\nThe world record for men, at 98.48 meters, is held by Jan Železný from the Czech Republic, set at Jena, Germany, on May 25, 1996. The world record for women, at 71.70 meters, is held by Osleidys Menéndez from Cuba, set at Helsinki, Fi",4760

9,"Has voter apathy ruined the U.K?

Isn't voter apathy destroying the British way of life? ; Voting apathy is only a problem for the elected representatives (MPs and councillors) of the people.  They fear that if not enough of us turn out to vote, they will feel they do not have a mandate to govern.  I think we reached that point about fifty years ago.  If the turn out is under 50 percent, how can any politician legitimately claim to have received a mandate from the people to govern them?\n\nLocal elections are a case in point - the same shipload of cut-throats get re-elected time and time again.

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree. And when the stomata (the hole on the underside of the leaf) opens for gas exchange, one water molecule at a time evaporates from the leaf, thus pulling the chain up one by one.

If your little one must take a nap in her/his crib, then forgo the long outing. Five month old babies are amused by anything, as you know, but only in small doses. I think you should try to find local places that take only a short drive to and from - that way you maximize your time at the place you want to be, and your baby probably won't fall asleep in the car on the way back if it's a short trip. I recommend just staying in your yard (if you have one) and playing or gardening; there are lots of things outside that would interest a five month old. Buy a bag of rice and dump it in a bowl; let him/her mess around with it outside, then hose it away when s/he is done. Buy a flat of cheap annuals along with whatever other flowers/vegetables you would like to grow; give your baby a clump of flowers (minus much of the soil) and let him destroy them (it's a great learning experience).

3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

Multiple encounters increase the risk of transmission substantially.\n\nContrary to popular belief, HIV is actually quite difficult to catch. It is about 5000 times more difficult to contract than Hepatitis C for example (another sexually transmitted disease).\n\nYou should always use a condom if you want to avoid risk; you cannot rely on a person knowing their status. You don't know your status right now do you? And it takes several years for AIDs to develop, so often people feel and appear completely healthy while being infectious.\n\nThe chance of transmission varies with the time that the person has been infected. In the early stages they can be very infectious (before there are any signs). They wil become less infectious after a while and if they are on a therapy, they may reduce their viral load so as to be imperceptable. This doesn't mean you cannot catch it from them but the chances are reduced.\n\nThere is nothing you can do at this time except wait, and do not have unprotected sex with anyone else.

Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint. \n\nThe books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).\n\nThe Christian Church did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint.\n\n1500 years later, Protestants decided to change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon. The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.\n\nHere is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/\n\n+ The Celibate Clergy + \n\nThe celibate clergy did not come into full bloom until about 1000 A.D. There were many married priests, bishops, and popes before this time.\n\nFirst, Judeo-Christian tradition has always held that single people be celibate. This is taught by Judaism and Christianity from before the Scriptures were written down.\n\nThe question should be: Why can't priests marry?\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nA priest is ""married"" to the Church. Some people think that a priest who takes his duties seriously cannot take proper care of a wife and family. ""A man cannot ser",4992
9,"What's the REAL reason marijuana is illegal? ; I'm sure it has nothing to do with taxation.\n\nI don't smoke it (though some of my friends do). Is there something about it that the government won't tell us?\n\nI just can't comprehend why cigarettes, alcohol, acetaminophen and naproxen (all products with detrimental health effects) are freely available to the public and regulated by the government. Especially considering the positive impact that pot can have on your health.\n\nIs it because it's hallucanigenic? Or is it some other reason? ; Well, marijuana isn't hallucinogenic...at least not normally.\n\nMy theories are a) racism b) the cotton and pharmaceutical lobby/taxation\n\nRacism--- Marijuana originally was a drug for blacks and just like Jim Crow laws, it was another way to stick it to 'em.  If you look through history, drugs only become illegal in America when associated w/ a minority group.  Take opium for instance...was enjoyed by Americans until the Chinese came to Cali to build the RR.  White men became worried that the Chinese men were seducing white women in their opium dens...so, they made it illegal as a mechanism of oppression.  \n\nLobbyists- Well, hemp is a wonderfully strong material and much more durable than cotton...and marijuana being herbal and something you could grow yourself means that pharmaceutical companies can't profit on.  \n\nThere is no good reason why marijuana is illegal, especially for medical use when oxycontin/morphine which can be deadly and is highly addictive is widely used.  It is so hypocritical.  Marijuana has been proven to treat glaucoma, and is a great pain reliever/appetite stimulant for cancer patients.\n\nFYI:  Teen drug use is lower in Amsterdam where everything is legal than is in the US.

9,"Though I am neutral about politics; what do you think of this 911 video? ; http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8260059923762628848&q=an+inconvenient+truth ; This video is very compelling evidence that there's a lot more to the events of 9/11 than most people know.  A few of the things in the Loose Change video are inaccurate, but it compiles enough accurate information to lead to further questions.  \n\nTo the people who say things like ""this has all been disproven"" or ""it's just conspiracy theories"" you are fooling yourselves.  The famous philospher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) said “All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed, second it is violently opposed, and third, it is accepted as self-evident”.  People will believe any lie either because they want it to be true, or because they fear it is true.  The lie you are believing is that the official story of how the events of 9/11 occurred are true.  When you OBJECTIVELY analysis the scientific evidence -- as a detective or scientist would -- without injecting false patriatism into the equation -- you realize that it is simply physically impossible that things happened as we've been led to believe.\nAnd  as a side note, questioning the events of 9/11 is NOT unpatriotic.  On the contrary, it's about the most patriotic thing you can do.  We have a duty to defend this great nation of ours against ALL threats, foriegn AND DOMESTIC.  And the families of the victims of 9/11 have a right to know the TRUTH of how and why their loved ones died.  In that spirit, I present the following very small bits of information concerning the events of 9/11.\n\nYou can’t collapse a skyscraper with jet fuel.\nMany engineers have come forward and said that there’s no way those buildings fell from fire.  Steel doesn’t weaken until almost 2000 degrees F, and it doesn’t melt until almost 3000 degrees F.  Jet fuel doesn’t burn hot enough to do it.\nThe official NIST report states “The initial jet fuel fires themselves lasted at most a few minutes” and office material fires would burn out within about 20 minutes in a given location. (NIST, 2005; p. 179, emphasis added.)   The final NIST report on the Towers admits:  \n""Of the more than 170 areas examined on 16 perimeter column panels, only three columns had evidence that the steel reached temperatures above 250ºC… Only two core column specimens had sufficient paint remaining to make such an analysis, and their temperatures did not reach 250 ºC. ... Using metallographic analysis, NIST determined that there was no evidence that any of the samples had reached temperatures above 600 ºC.""  (NIST, 2005, pp. 176-177) \nKevin Ryan, the engineer from the company that underwrote the towers, said it was impossible that a jet fuel fire brought the towers down.  The architect who designed the twin towers has repeatedly said that he designed them to take not 1, but 2, massive passenger airliner impacts and not fall.  \nPools of molten steel were found in the basements of the towers (including tower 7) weeks after 9/11.  Steel melts at 2777 degrees F.  Jet fuel burns at only 1577 degrees F.  It is literally impossible for jet fuel fires to get hot enough to melt steel into molten pools.  Something else must have done it.\n\nFirefighters and survivors said repeatedly that bombs were going off throughout the towers, on many different floors. Firefighters gave very specific descriptions of seeing flashes of light and explosions going off on the lower levels.   If you watch the news from that morning, you'll even see Fox news reporting a ""4th explosion"" going off in tower 1.   For instance, at the start of the collapse of the South Tower a Fox  News anchor reported:   “There is an explosion at the base of the building… white smoke from the bottom… something happened at the base of the building!  Then another explosion.”\nFirefighter Edward Cachia independently reported:  \n“[We] thought there was like an internal detonation, explosives, because it went in succession, boom, boom, boom, boom, and then the tower came ",5003
2,"How easy is it to insert a tampon for the very first time? ; I imagine it would help if you were already masturbating so that you were familiar with your anatomy. ; I think I know why you're asking. Maybe you have a young girlfriend and you're asking for her.\n\nI am talking now of personal experience.\n\nI started masturbating as a child, many years before my period started. When I got my period, I discoverd it while I was masturbating....\n.... that was very disgusting....\nJust as a proof that many girls also masturbate at a young age.\n\nIf a girl masturbates, she knows her body better than a girl that doesn't. I heard many questions like ""where to put the tampon"" - this is just weird. I also just read a question about that here.... and I answered this girl that she should masturbate to learn more about her body.\n\nBut really, using a tampon has nothing to do with masturbation itself. Using a tampon has in general no pleasing factor. It's not really great to use tampons, you just have to.\n\nThe first time, it could hurt a little, but the girl should carefully read the instructions in the box of the tampons.\nThen it will be alright.",5005
1,"How come Time and Space did not exist before the Big Bang? ; Yeah, how come? Of to any explosion exists there has to be air and given that the big bang was an explosion, then air and space and time shall exist before it, am I not right?\n\nTry to teach me how to understand correctly why time and space were created at the ""time"" of the big bang... \n\ntnx in antecipation, kisses to the chicks and hugs to the boys,\n\n\nie - brazil ; Time is a relative perception. It is a man-made creation. We measure time from our perception (ie a year is one revolution around the Sun, a day is one rotation of the Earth, Weeks and months are based on Julian (Roman) and many other cultures' calendars from the past). Time is all relative. The most widely accepted reference point for time was 0 AD (Anno Domini, in the year of our Lord) Basically, based in Christian dogma.\n\nTime is something we cannot perceive in the physical world and is a very abstract concept. We say a light-year is the distance light travels in a year. That year is based upon our perception of time. However, if you took the length of Pluto's ""year"" or one revolution around the Sun, which is over 200 Earth years a light year would actually be a smaller distance (not by much, but it would make a difference).\n\nTo answer your other question. Air is required for combustion (namely the oxygen in the air). It is not required for explosion. The Sun is a constant nuclear fusion reaction created by the fusion of Hydrogen and Helium atoms. Also, most theories point to an anti-matter/matter reaction as to what created the Big Bang. The Big Bang is also a misnomer. Most likely, an imbalance of anti-matter and matter created a chain reaction resulting in an ""explosion"" and expansion of the singularity that began the Universe. However, that singularity wasn't inifinitely small. In relative size it was probably larger than several galaxies. However, an anti-matter/matter explosion creates pure energy. So, why is there still matter? Most likely, it was because the imbalance tilted to the matter side. Thus, leaving the matter that created the Universe. Matter is essentially highly condensed energy. Therefore, much of the energy created during the Big Bang went to both the expansion of the Universe and the creation of galaxies/stars/planets etc\n\nThe Big Bang also wasn't an ""explosion"" in the sense that you think of it. It is more widely considered a massive cosmolgical event and expansion caused by a massive chain reaction. Hence, why it is a misnomer.\n\nScientists measure ""Time"" from this point (the Big Bang), however, it is still unclear exactly how long ago it was, and our best estimates are still measured in Earth time (years.) And the galaxy is widely accepted to be about 15-20 billion years old.",5006

I am not talking about drug sniffing dogs.\n\nTwo cases I am thinking of are the Jessica Lunsford(sp) case in FLA...where the dog didnt locate her body in the shallow grave.....and the Scott Peterson case...where the dog handler was allowed to testify( he(the dog..lol) sniffed at the end of the dock...denoting that she was in the water).\n\n\nShould dogs be allowed to be used(sniffing) in criminal cases? Not as a tool or method for law enforcement but should they be able to ""testify"" in court....and of course I don't mean the dog  but the handler re: testimony? ; The actual use of a dog is quite exact. The problem you run into are the training techniques and the fact that certain dogs (and handlers) should not pass the training certs they are required to. Many of the 'good dogs' are almost 100% right and even when they alert, and there is nothing there, there HAS been something there in the past. For example drug and 'people' dogs, those used to find illegal aliens on the border. Many times they will alert to an area and no one or no dope is found. If the dog is good, then you can practically guaruntee that there was something there in the past. Also take for example that bloodhounds are the only dog that can be used for a track and their nose is the only one you can make a warrantless entry. Yet the bloodhounds I worked with couldnt find a bisquit.\nRef testimony: if the dog has an excellent history, I believe that what they alert to should be used in court. Obviously not as the only thing, but is an extremely good indication that something was illegal, there, not right etc. If the dog has a record of mis-alerts then I believe that the 'testimony' of the dog should not be used. Once again, here lies the problem. Its difficult to prove when a dog is mediocre as his failures are rarely reported on, only his successes.",5027

Last night, we were talking like we always do and I asked her if she wanted to go to the mall on saturday and have some fun.  She said she had a boyfriend she'd been going out with for over a year.  I thought it was wierd that I'd known her for that long and hadn't even heard him mentioned in passing.  Then, she said he was ""very protective,"" but she'd ask if it was OK with him.  That's when the warning bells started going off in my head.  First off, I was worried that by ""protective"" she meant ""controlling,"" and wondered why she needed someone's permission to do what she wanted with whom she wanted.  \n\nThe main question I have is, should I be worried, or is she just not interested in me and I'm bad at taking a hint?  To be honest, I'm hoping it's the latter.  She's a sweet girl and deserves better than that. ; It's hard to say but from what you said I heard signals going off too.

I heard though that they didn't want it aired again due to complaints but I don't know. I don't remember too much about the movie but I do know that at the end everyone gets together and burns the guy up due to him  being a child molester and was killing children and he was a very bad man. keep in mind that this movie came out before the very first freddy movie did. I remember watching the movie I am asking about and I know it wasn't a nightmare movie he was real in this movie the whole time. I believe that this movie was based on a true story about a man a long time ago and it is part of what started the freddy movies which is why he is burned and in the first freddy they show a clip of this movie where the people had set him on fire. I think this movie was under a differint name though. I don't know what it is. and this is where I need the help I need a name ; I'm unable to find anything like you mentioned.  My guess is since it aired only once, you will not find a listing for it now.  And there is no way to determine whether the movie was based on real events or not.  Many times those are just rumors.\n\nAccording to all I have read about the Nightmare series, it originated out of the mind of David Lynch, not out of a real event.

So, Poncho sets off down the road, slow and steady. \n\nTwenty days pass, but no Poncho. Joe and Steve are hungry and puzzled, but a promise is a promise.

(christianity answers only please) ; Though I have never stopped believing in God, some of the things that I have gone through in my life have made me doubt his ""holy"" purpose for my life.  My home life could use a lot of inprovement (namely my father, though our relationship did inprove during my softmore year of H.S. i grew bigger than him, and thus dont fear him anymore, we just avoid each other now), in a period of 2 years i had to bury 4 of my best friends (no one should ever have to go through that), and i could go on for a long time.  I began to serve God when i was about 12, and i served him with all of my heart, i finnally had hope, i knew that he cared for me, he was going to make my life better, but he never did anything.  the only improvement that i experienced, was when i stood up against my father, but it was a sin (""Honor thy father and mother"")  If he's so ""loving"", why is a direct act against one of his commandments the only thing that ever helped me? ; At tims in our lives we pass through some very difficult situations and we begin to wonder why certain things are happpening to us, it is almost as if we are alone in this world. It is almost as if nobody cares and we are greatly troubled, our faith and beliefs are really shaken.\n\nWe may even begin to wonder why our loved ones have to die, we question why there is war in this world. We are more troubled when we see innocent people die on in accidents caused by troubled or drunk drivers.\n\nAt other times we are greatly troubled by our family members and our family situations, we wonder why we are in certain family dies, we even question if there is indeed a creator and why are all bad things keep happening, sucide might even be the perfect solution to our predicaments but:\n\nthere is this voice reaching out to us from a loving Father who we may even try to question wheter or not he knows our situation, the word reaches out and tells us that THOUGH SORROW MAY ENDURE FOR SOMETIME, JOY COMES IN THE MORNING.\n\nit is true, you may be passing through really tough times, i have been there, i have even attempted sucide. however i have realised the depth of My Heavenly Father's love even though it is still very difficult for me (to fathom the depth  of this love). I have realised that EVERYTHING WORKS TOGETHER FOR THE GOOD OF THOSE WHO TRULY BELIEVE IN HIM. i know that at times i may pass through some very tough times and think God is not there, but i have come to realise that no matter how bad that situation might be, by trusting in God, He will and He always certainly turns it around for my own. Besides at times when he seems the most silent, i realise that he is only carrying me.  \n\nIt is true that doubts will come and your faaher may even make situations worse for you, but one thing i can certainly assure you of is that God knows of your situation, and do not let your doubt steal away the Father's love for you.  \n\nContinue praying for your father and realise that in honouring your father you should love the Lord your God with all your heart and all of your strenght (by not doing what is against his will). At  times our parents may be pretty difficult, but we must realise that some of them are only trying to show thier love in the way the know our to.\n\nThough going a ggainst God's ways at times gives us a perfect solution, but if we truly search deep within our hearts we often always find out that we only get temporary joy. It may be that dishonouring your father really helped you, but I do not know wheter it invoved your going agsinst God's will.\n\nGod's plans FOR you are of good and not evil, he will certainly give you a hope and a future (JEREMAIH 29:11).\n\nAytime it seems as if the doors of this world are shutting down on you remember that:\n\nEVEN THOUGH YOU WALK THROUGH THE SHADOW OF THE VALLEY OF DEATH, YOU SHOULD FEAR KNOW EVIL, FOR THE LORD IS WITH YOU...(Psalm 23:4)\n\nYour serving and believing in him is no guarranty that you will not pass through problems and bad situations but it is an assurance that he will give you joy, peace and strenght at all times so continue like never before:\n\nTRUST IN THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND DO NOT RELY ON O YOUR OWN INSIGHT, IN ALL OF YOUR WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM AND HE WILL MAKE YOUR PATH STRAIGHT (PROV 3:5-6)\n\nmail me if you want: bilewomo@yahoo.com",5099

5,"whats a good way to improve your time  in swimming ? ; in a meet during the 50 yrd. backsroke and freestyle  how do you improve your time?   especially if your really slow  i wont say how slow.......... ; Be encouraged that if you seriously set a goal to improve your time, then you will!  These are some steps to take along the way.  First, work with experienced and trustworthy tutors to learn swim techniques.  Ask several coaches to watch you swim and accept their corrections and suggestions. Practice what works for you and discard what doesn't.  If possible, select one coach to encourage you, time you, spur you on.  Second, borrow books from the library about swimming, watch video tapes, and you will discover a lot.  Read Total Immersion material. You will be fascinated with your reading.  Also, research your topic on line to find articles about backstroke and freestyle.   Third, working your fast twitch muscles will help you improve time.  As you improve in technique, then -- and only then --practice harder and faster swims each time you get in the water.  Watch the clock and try to improve each week.  Most importantly, have patience with yourself and be less self-critical.  Let go of negative thoughts and stay positive.  A great deal of swimming is mental activity so stay positive.    As you practice new techniques to improve your strokes, you will find yourself improving, getting a better feel for the water.  In the end, you might surprise yourself with an improved attitude and an incredible mind-set about life.",5130

I asked her if she was seeing somebody, and she hesitated (what does the hesitation mean) before saying that she had been seeing somebody for a year. I told her I was happy for her.

0,"who was first in the land of israel; arabic or jewish people or other? ; I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land and actually how the whole thing started   were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left? Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now? ; >>>>I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land….\n\nThe trouble is that the question makes no sense. Both historically and mythologically the Jews were Arabs. They aren’t a different people, they are simply a different religious sect. Prior to the rise of Islam around 1500 years ago the Middle East and North Africa was home to thousands of different religions, and one of those religions was Judaism. The different sects were in a state of near perpetual war with their neighbours as well as with the great powers like Babylon and Egypt.\n\nFrom a purely historical perspective it seems that one of the numerous religious sects living in Palestine gained the upper hand, either through theocratic means or through warfare or a combination of the two. Gradually they absorbed all the other people of that region and formed the state of Israel.\n\nBear in mind also that even at the time of Christ present day Israel wasn’t entirely Jewish occupied or controlled. Much of it was in Samaria, the Samaritans being a Hebrew but not Jewish sect that didn’t accept the absolute sanctity of the temple.\n\nSo as you can see it’s not a simple case of saying the Arabs or Jews were there first. Historically Jews are Arabs and Jews never historically occupied all of what is now Israel.\n\n>>>> were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left?\n\nA little from column A, a little from column B.\n\nRemember how at the time of Jesus Israel had been occupied by the Romans?  Needless to say the Jews didn’t like that, and the situation was further aggravated by the Romans doing various stupid and offensive things. Eventually the people of Jerusalem and much of Judeaea got fed up and rebelled. A lot of Romans were killed, a lot more Jews were killed, a lot of Jews killed themselves rather than be captured. \n\nThe Romans ascribed the unrest to a religious source and decided that enough was enough and The Temple was torn down. \n\nWithout the temple to sacrifice at the Jews had no strong reason to cling to Israel, and combined with Roman persecution they mostly decided to leave in several waves over the next few hundred years.\n\nSo you could say that it was a voluntary Exodus, but it was just as much a refugee movement.\n\n>>>>Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now?\n\nBasically because\n\n1)It is the traditional Jewish homeland and a lot of Jews wanted it back.\n2)Jews had a lot of political clout in Washington after the war.\n3) Jews had been regularly slaughtered in Europe over the last 2000 years, and the recent Nazi holocaust was by far the worst example. A lot of people tjought that it would be a good idea not let it keep happening, and decided the best way to do that would be to give the Jews their own country outside Europe.\n\nCombine those three factors and you see a simple solution to all problems/ The fact that Palestine was a British colony/protectorate at the time and Britain wanted to offload all its colonies as fast as possible helped no end.\n\nBenji Man  wrote:\n>>>>>Africa is the cradle of civ so I will go with an early nomadic african people.\n\nAfrica is not the cradle of civilisation. Asia is without a doubt the cradle of civilisation with a second nucleus in Central America.",5158

1,"Does blood plasma contain oxygen or fibrin protein? ; This question was on my exam today. I looked it up but still not sure. Oxygen is insoluble in water and plasma is made up of 90% water. Also fibrin is a substance converted from fibrinogen protein. If fibrinogen protein is in plasma, does this mean that fibrin protein is in blood plasma? The question on the exam asked what was NOT in plasma: oxygen, fibrin protein, antibody, or electrolyte? ; Plasma contains a very small fraction of oxygen.Almost all oxygen is loaded in the RBC.Fibrinogen has to be converted into fibrin and this is possible when the platelets rupture to release thrombokinase.This enzyme converts prothrombin into thrombin which acts upon firbrinogen to convert it into fibrin.However this is dangerous as much of fibrin in the plasma will block the flow of blood in the  blood vessel.The blood clot is bunch of fibrin molecules.

5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.

5,"Why do College Football institutions schedule so many teams so far in advance? ; Most schools have teams scheduled for 5 years. That's great for planning trips but how do you know how good a team will be 5 years down the line. ; It's all about the mighty dollar. Television crews have to set up their equipment and the stations advertise. College athletic programs depend on dollars generated from the football team and athletic directors are always looking to bolster their exposure by scheduling the big name teams. With the success of the USC, Miami, Ohio State, Texas, Notre Dame and few I've left out, every team in America is looking to schedule a game with them. So by signing contracts well in advance with these well known teams, a smaller school can lock into a non-conference game and get much needed exposure even if the scoreboard isn't a close contest. But just think of the headlines and publicity if a smaller school like Boise State or Fresno State can knock off one of the big boys? Last year's USC vs Fresno State game was a great battle.",5210

1,"Can an antibiotic act as an antibody? ; I'm trying to answer this question comparing the disk diffusion method and animal model.  If a disk diffusion method does not show any signs of zone inhibition but the animal model does recovery from the infection, what would be the causes? ; No, antibiotics are compounds that inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria whereas antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to bind to a specific epitope such as the glycopeptides on some bacterial surfaces. Once bound, they can trigger other immune responses to kill the invading bacteria.\nThe problem with the disk diffusion method of antibiotic susceptibility testing is that it can't be a true representative of what goes on in vivo in your animal model. The test gives the bacteria ideal growth conditions with the addition of the antibiotic, but there are many more factors to take into account in the animal model. Antibodies are a good example as they will help the immune system attack the bacteria. The addition of the antibiotic in the animal probably helps keep the numbers of the bacteria down while its building an immune response to clear the infection.",5216

I think not, they lost to an unranked team, they should've had a drop off like Texas did (13th).

Same with the Big 10, OSU and Michigan completely dominate that region. Not to take away from those two, they are quality, solid teams, but if they had a schedule like the teams in the SEC, then we'd see their true mettle. The SEC needs to stop cannibalizing itself and killing it's chances at a championship bid.

However, many teachers still disagree on this, so honestly if you're writing a school paper, you should ask your teacher what to do.  And next year, ask your new teacher the same question.\n\nYou do need the comma+and combination when you are connecting two different clauses in the same sentence.  A ""clause"" works like a sentence by itself, becuase it has a noun and a verb.  However some clauses don't make sense by themselves, for example ""and he is also very handsome.""

1,"A human skin cell has 46 chromosomes. After Mitosis, how many chromosomes will the new skin cell have? ?? ; A human skin cell has 46 chromosomes. After Mitosis, how many chromosomes will the new skin cell have? ??\nthanks ; Human cells have 46 chromosomes. To ensure that each daughter cell receives one and only one of each chromosome, eukaryotic cells undergo a complex, multistep process called mitosis. Before mitosis can begin, eukaryotes must first replicate their DNA. This process is similar to but takes much longer than DNA replication in prokaryotes. Then, during mitosis, the replicated chromosomes line up along the center line of the cell. Tiny fibers, called spindle fibers, attach to the individual chromosomes and pull them apart, toward opposite poles of the cell, where they remain until the cell divides.\n\nLong story short, the new skin cell will still have 46 chromosomes.",5477

It's $29.50.\n\nAlso, here's an article on yogajournal.com that may be of some help:\n\nYoga for Multiple Sclerosis\n\nI have multiple sclerosis and have been practicing Iyengar yoga for a few months. It's been very beneficial. Is there anything I can focus on to bring more progress? \n\nBy Baxter Bell\n\n— Jessica Howland, Kihei, Hawaii \n\nBaxter Bell's reply:\n Jessica, your entry into hatha yoga with the Iyengar method was a fortuitous choice. The ability to adapt the poses with props can be particularly beneficial with multiple sclerosis (MS), since flare-ups can affect strength, balance, and coordination. \nIt’s also important for you to know about a very unique Iyengar teacher, Eric Small (located in the Los Angeles area), whose personal story of developing MS in his late teens and reclaiming his health through his study with Mr. Iyengar is almost legendary. His experience eventually led him to work with the National MS Society to create a yoga teacher-training program for teachers who want to work with students with MS. I was fortunate enough to participate in this course in 2001 with Eric as the lead instructor. \n\nStudying with an MS-trained instructor can improve your chances of moving through the practice at an appropriate pace for whatever stage of the MS cycle you may find yourself in. In addition, you will learn specific sequences designed for challenges such as fatigue, constipation, problems with digestion, lack of mental clarity, or balance. Balance, for example, can be addressed with asanas such as Tadasana (Mountain Pose), Virabhadrasana I (Warrior Pose I) and Virabhadrasana II (Warrior Pose II), and Trikonasana (Triangle Pose). \n\nFor a student with MS, there are three types of symptoms that hatha yoga directly addresses: fatigue and heat intolerance, numbness in the limbs and loss of coordination, and loss of flexibility and balance. Fatigue and heat intolerance appear to be the most limiting factors to MS students. To counter these limitations, students learn to master the breath and practice restorative postures. Both techniques cool the body and calm the nervous system. The simple breathing technique of lengthening the exhalation a little longer than the inhalation helps quiet the nervous system. It’s been observed that heat, stress, and tension can cause temporary worsening of MS symptoms, so keep the pace of practice relaxed but focused—keeping the body just shy of sweating is important. \n\nMS can also result in a daily battle with numbness of the arms and legs, muscle spasms, and loss of coordination. The system of yoga emphasizes stretching and breathing, which can release tension and improve circulation and body awareness. Yoga practice can also facilitate harmony between the muscular and nervous systems of the body, possibly resulting in more fluid movement and relief from muscle tension. As a student’s level of body awareness improves, she can begin to recognize the first signs of stress on her system before it overwhelms her. \n\nFinally, in addition to evolving body awareness, yoga increases flexibility and balance. The poses increase the range of motion in the joints and improve muscle tone, and work of most of the body’s muscle groups. \n\nYour yoga practice can be tailored according to your needs. If you are in a period of remission and your balance is intact, you can often do most of poses practiced in an ordinary class setting. During periods of relapse, stay in the groove of practicing by doing a modified practice, for example lying supine on the floor or utilizing chairs and the wall. \n\nThe effect of hatha yoga on MS is of such great interest that the National Institutes of Health’s National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine division has funded a study of the effects of yoga on MS patients. Preliminary data shows improvement speci",5512

And I understand how scary it is to be going under surgery.\n\nThe suggestion of getting an epidural-steroid injection is a smart idea. It is usually used for bulging disks that rest on nerves or to reduce complications/issues in a post surgical environment. I had this done both before and after the partial laminectomy on my L5-S1 disk.\n\nFor me, I had to come to grips that surgery would be the only way out of the pain I was experiencing. I was in a rear-end collision (I was the one hit) and it ruptured a healthy disk that went untreated for 6 months (25 weeks to the day). I suffer for that delay (and it is in litigation with Worker's Comp). Even when I found that the surgery was being scheduled (and gratefully so), I was terrified the day before. I could not sleep, rest, or even get it off my mind.\n\nThe doc eben asked me the morning of my surgery (he is not quick to cut) if this is what I wanted. He told me that there was a 30% chance that I will not be healed and that of the 30%, there was a 50% chance that I would be paralyzed down the left side. My only question to him was ""Will the pain end?"" He said ""Yes"" and that cinched it.\n\nI am not saying that surgery is the answer. I am saying that being scared is okay. Even with 2 months of being ready for the inevitable surgery, I was still afraid the night before. I knew the risks, I knew the possible complications. I am glad that I did have the surgery. With the proper follow-up care and adherance to physicians' orders, you can heal remarkably well. And depending on which disk it is, you can be relatively back to normal as if the repairs were never needed.\n\nFor me, I will never be able to do what I used to. But then again, it was untreated for 6 months and it is a primary load-bearing disk.\n\nI hope this has helped.",5523

Anointing was the inaugural ceremony for priests\n\nI think the latter portion of the definition is the most applicable to this usage.  As you know, all Born Again believers are priests according to the Order of Melchizedek, with Jesus as our High Priest.  This ""chrisma"" is given to us at the time we're saved to show we're approved priests.  This annointing includes the giving of spiritual gifts.  The only difference is that the annointing shows we're priests; the gifts permit us to carry out an individual ministry to the glory of God. \n\nPeace.",5534

Do you think its a wise investment? or i would rather invest it in real estate bcos im thinking about the inflation,the value of money or purchasing power of money wont be the same after 17 yrs when i reach the age of 45. PLEASE HELP! ; I don't know what Php mean.. I guess you are somewhere outside of the United States.\n\nAnyway, let me explain what an investment in a life policy is. First, this investment is not for your retirement. This investment is known as a ""cash value"" in the life insurance industry. If you wanted to use it anytime, you will have to borrow it and pay back with interest. This interest does not go back into your investment, but rather kept by the insurance company. If you miss any premiums or decide to stop paying in the future, the insurance company will use your cash value to pay for it. When you die, you will lose all cash value and your family will only get the death benefit.\n\nWhat I would do? Buy a 30 year term policy with Php500,000 coverage. You said you want to invest in real estate. You may do that, but I recommend investing in mutual funds too. When your term policy expires, you probably won't need life insurance if you invest wisely and continue to put away money each month.",5548

Not good gets you into bad habbits .Its more like a pulling off the mound into the stride then pushing into the release . \nA good practice for this is stand at the mound go into your routine simulate your movements to the place go step by step every motion check your body position into each step. Break it down steps 1 to 5  \n\n1.your starting stance Check your balance \n2.your raise into your windup check balance look at your footing \n\n3. from windup into your stride check balance arm position did you get proper waist rotation did you push off the mound. \n\n4 look at your arm are you at your right release point .is it in correct position if not at a perfect point gonna cause loss of velocity and cause improper control of the pitch.\n\n5 check your balance after the stretch do you still have proper balance.\n \n\n\ncauses balance issues and takes away from your volicity and has a tendency of causing alot of wild pitches.

Anyone can help me with this, about 200 words because I have only few minutes to talk about this. Thank you very much. ; Try to download the free Visual C# Express 2005 from Microsoft and also check the online documentation of MSDN. \n\nThese are the excerpt from the documentation:\n\n""C# Language\nC# syntax is highly expressive, yet with less than 90 keywords, it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin working productively in C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ while providing powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, anonymous methods and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# also supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code.\n\nAs an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.\n\nIn addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# facilitates the development of software components through several innovative language constructs, including:\n\nEncapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.\n\nProperties, which serve as accessors for private member variables. \n\nAttributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time. \n\nInline XML documentation comments.\n\nIf you need to interact with other Windows software such as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs, you can do this in C# through a process called ""Interop.""

I haven't got it back yet... do I have a case? ; Since the nature of the case, that you were not intoxicated, and that no test was preformed, I would take the Sheriff or Sheriff's to court, in the majority of the outcome of them actually going to court (depends on the county and state) but a lot of legal athority do not show up for court, they are not required. Since there was that $275 cash and important papers that didn't get recived they might end up in court. Usually if they don't show up to court your outcome is at a greater advantage for you.",5655

1,"find the demensions of the largest open box? ; that can be made from teh a sheet of tin that is 24in by 24in by cutting equal squares from the corners and turning up the sides ; Call the side of the square you cut out x, then the box you make will have a square base of side (24 - 2x) and the height will be x. \n\nThe area of this box is then (24 - 2x)^2*x = 2x*(12 - x)^2. Call this a function of x, and we need to find the maximum.\n\n2x^3 -48x^2 + 288x = f(x)\n\n6x^2 - 96x + 288 = f'(x) = 0\n\nx^2 - 16x + 48 = 0\n\n(x - 12)(x - 4) = 0\n\nSo this has the 2 answers x = 12 and x = 4.\n\nx = 12 gives a minimum (volume = 0), so x = 4 is a maximum,  1024\n---------------\nI just looked at the above answers. JimBurnel made a careless error, the volume should be x(24 - 2x)^2, not x(24 - 2x). The rest of his logic is right, but the equation is wrong.\n\nAnd Paritosh Vasava assumes by ""largest"" you want surface area, I assume you mean volume.

1,"number of chromatids per chromosome during cell cycle? ; I need to know how many chromatids per chromosome there are for the stages G1, S, G2, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nI think its \nG1=1, \nS=2, \nG2=2, \nprophase=2, \nmetaphase=2,\nanaphase=1\ntelophase=2\n\nAm I correct in my thinking or do I have the whole thing messed up or just some of it? ; In G1, there are 46 chromosomes, EACH CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHROMATID.  You will have two copies of chromosome one (one from mom, the other from dad), two copies of chromosome two, etc.  These pairs are called homologues.  Consequently there are 23 homologous chromosomes in G1 and, again, there is one chromatid per chromosome in this phase.  This gives a total of 46 chromosomes.  You should know that each chromosome is decondensed (not coiled up) at this time. \n\nS phase is the synthesis or replication phase of the cell cycle.  After S phase is complete, the definition of a chromosome changes.  It is now a ""replicated chromosome"" that consists of 2 chromatids (some texts describe these as ""sister chromatids"").  Again, the total number of chromosomes is 46; however, because of the definition change of the S-phase chromosome, each chromosome how includes twice as much DNA due to replication.  After S phase there are two chromatids per chromosome.  These chromosomes are decondensed.\n\nIn G2, there are 46 chromosomes:  2 chromatids per chromosome, decondensed, with the chromosomes existing in homologous pairs.\n\nIn prophase of mitosis, the chromosomes condense to facilitate easy separation into the daughter cells.  Here there are still 2 chromatids per chromosome.\n\nIn metaphase, there are STILL 2 chromatids per chromosome, all smartly arranged at the ""equator"" of the cell, the metaphase plate.\n\nIn anaphase, the replicated chromosomes (i.e., the ""sister chromatids"") are pulled apart.  At the point that they are separated, the definition of a chromosome changes AGAIN, BACK to a single chromatid.  Each daughter cell will receive 46 of these single chromatids and, therefore, will have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs.  The chromosomes are still condensed at this point.\n\nIn telophase, the chromosome situation is exactly the same.  23 homologous PAIRS of chromosomes (46 single chromatids).  The difference here is that the chromosomes are now decondensing.\n\nSummary:  the number of chromatids per chromosome\n\nG1-1\nafter S- 2\nG2-2\nprophase-2\nmetaphase-2\nlate anaphase-1\ntelophase-1",5666

You didn't say how the ex feels about you. Why does she deny him seeing his child? Because I do not know if my answer will help if you don't have the same life I had. The ex hated me and didn't mind telling everyone she knew. She thought I was the root of their separation. I didn't even know my now husband at the time they 1st broke up. I had been going with him for about 5 months when I found out that he wasn't DIVORCED! So for that reason she used us being together as what was wrong with their relationship. She told everyone that Mike drank all the time and that she didn't trust him being alone with his son. When really it was a way to punch him for leaving her. The reason for not getting a divorce right away, he didn't want them to cancell their medical insurance. Dumb then...we played her game for many months. Then I started checking things out. He could get the divorce, keep insurance on his kid, pay child support (a must) and the court would let him have his son every other weekend. If she didn't produce the child..She could go to jail.

I am assuming your friends brother has access to mental health services ie: a CPN (Community Psychiatric Nurse) for example.  Depending on which service works with him ie: early intervention (if it is his first episode, home treatment etc you should be able to to speak with the named person who is working with him.\n\nIf he is on medication, he must have a Consultant Psychiatrist as they are the only one who can issue the medication and decide on the best form of treatment.\n\nMarijuana can bring about drug induced pshychosis, am not sure if this is the case with your brothers friend but, you need to try and speak with him about cutting down on it's use.  Most people within mental health services tend to use drugs as an 'alternative' to western medicine.\n\nDon't know where you live but there are many support groups/agencies available to also speak with.  try looking at Rethink, Mind, Mencap and Nimhe websites.

Does a current carrying wire induce an electric field as well as a magnetic field. I calculated the energy density of the magnetic field but the next question asked for the energy density of the electric field. ; I'm assuming that the current is not changing with time other than the initial turn-on transient.\n\nWhen the current has reached a steady state (didn't say reached zero, but some final state), you are in the area of electromagnetics called electro/magnetostatics and the magnetic and electric fields are uncoupled. For the situation that you describe (I'm assuming no stationary charges external to the wire), the Electric Field Density is zero.\n\nYou might be tempted to use Gauss' Law to find the Electric Field from an individual electron as it moved down the wire, but the summation at any particular point in space from all charges moving in the wire will sum to zero.\n\nWhen the current is first turned on you will have a changing magnetic field and therefore an electric field. However, that electric field will die away rapidly.",5737

Here goes.\n\n1. It is not a foul if you hit the ball away from opponent's hand, assuming you only made initial contact with the ball, and not the opponent's hand nor other body parts in the process.\n\n2. Player with ball can not push the opponent. \n\n3. Player can attempt to take the ball away from any position, assuming they only make initial contact with the ball, and don't make contact with the ball holder's hand, body, etc.\n\n4. Kicking the ball accidently results in a stoppage of play. The team that did not kick the ball gets possession.  It is not considered a personal foul.\n\n5. It is legal, thus not a foul, to throw the ball at any bodypart of the  opponent in the hopes of it going out of bounds to maintain posession.  It would be considered good sportsmanship to try to avoid throwing the ball at the face and/or sensitive reproductive organs of the opponent.",5753

In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.\n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.\n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.",5797

6,"When is the world going to end? ; When is the world going to end? \n\nAccording to God's Word, the Bible, Planet Earth will never ""end"" in the sense of being forever done away with. It will, however, be radically reshaped by God's creative fire into a planet, or world, much different than it is presently. \n\nJesus' disciples asked him in the Olivet discourse to tell them when the end of the world would come. Actually, they asked: when will be the end of the age? The question involved the end of human history as it had been known to that point. That age about which they questioned the Lord is still going on in our time. \n\nJesus answered by giving a list of prophetic signs that will precede His Second Coming. Christ indicated that the world, as it was then known, and is now known, would end when He returned. Revelation tells us that Jesus' Millennial Kingdom will be the next ""earth age."" \n\nIt will last 1000 years, after which time the Great White Throne judgment will take place, where all lost people of all ages will be judged and sentenced to eternity apart from God. Hell is their final place of residence, from which there will be no escape. \n\nPlanet Earth will then be remade into something more glorious than can be imagined or described by the humanmind, this side of Heaven. Peter, the apostle, through Divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit, gives us just a glimpse of Earth's ultimate destiny: \n\n""But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.""(2 Peter 3: 10-13) God's Word promises: \n\n""One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever."" (Ecclesiastes 1:4) ; well the bible says no man knows the day or the hour.  but you will know the season.  that to me says we may verywell be able to narrow it down to within a few months of when christs second coming will happen.  century score decade year season month and week all come before day and hour we may be even able to tell the WEEK of his coming. the bible say we will know the season.  not we MAY know it says we WILL know. maybe that can be taken literally.\n I can say biblically it must happen between now and the year 2018\n\nthe bible says the generation that sees israel reborn as a nation shall not pass before the second coming israel was reborn as a nation in 1946 the bible defines a generation as 72 years therefore. do the math.\n\nWE ARE IN THE END TIMES PEOPLE!\n\nknow this the US MUST TURN AND COME AGAINST ISRAEL TO FULFILL BIBLICAL PROPHESY.  the bible says ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD will come against israel\n\nwhen will the world end.

4,"Is DSL or Cable internet connection more secure? What is needed to connect cable to a computer? ; I an looking to chhange from Dialup to either DSL or Cable. I'm looking for pro and cons of each. ; Neither one is more secure than the other.  The security comes in how you secure your own computer using AntiVirus software, personal firewalls, Ad or Spamware, etc.  You may see a slight degradation of service using Cable in the evening when more people are home and using their cable modems.  Otherwise, the main difference will be in cost.  As for what you need to connect to your computer, both Cable and DSL will come into your home into some sort of a modem.  From there you will just need an ethernet cable (you can get these at any computer or electronics store, such as Best Buy, Radio Shack, Fry's Electronics, etc), which will plug directly into your Ethernet (NIC) card in your computer.  The plug on your computer will look like the modem plug, but will be slightly larger.  See the link below for more information on DSL and Cable.  Good luck.",5814

Look at the original greek that N.T. was written in.\n4 minutes ago\nYHWH is not pronounced ""YahoVaH"". Where is the V in YHWH? It's yahweh, you slide the vowels into each letter including the W.\n4 minutes ago\nYHWH is not pronounced ""YahoVaH"". Where is the V in YHWH? It's yahweh, you slide the vowels into each letter including the W.\n\nThose who are qouting jehovah from the O.T. are using an incorrect translation. The KJV is a horrible translation  that is nowhere near the greek of the Bible. ; In the Hebrew OT, YHWH (still to close to the name of God for Hebrews to feel safe) was frequently replaced with Adonai - Hebrew for ""Lord."" (which is why the Greek NT uses Kurios - ""Lord"").  Your 13th Century monk used the vowled from Adonai with YHWH to form YaHoWaH - but in Ecclesiastical Latin 'J' and 'W' did not exist, so it became Jaehovah.\n\nMajor literary works, like the KJV, do as much to create language as to use the existing language.  So now, in English, Jehovah is the word for the name of God; in Hebrew it's YHWH.  Just like my name is Mark in English, Marco in Italian, and Maruku in Japanese - people use the letters and sounds available to them within the structure of their own language.",5817

Bush's ""Sanctity of Marriage"" gay marriage constitutional ban. \nGeorge W. Bush's marital problems have just taken another turn for the worse. Apparently, Mr. Bush has not only engaged in an extra-marital affair with a member of the opposite sex who is also a senior member of his Cabinet, but also a member of the same sex. WMR received the following  release this morning from Leola McConnell, Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada (who has been endorsed by WMR). McConnell is a one-time professional dominatrix.\n""President Bush's speech to the nation Monday. If he doesn't say he's a gay American or at the least a bisexual one then he shouldn't be making one at all. And the notion that it would be in regards to writing bigotry into our nation's Constitution is reprehensible. Too bad it isn't me doing the rebuttal because in 1984, I watched him perform (with the enthusiasm of homosexual male who had done this many times before) a homosexual act on another man, namely Victor Ashe. Victor Ashe is the current Ambassador to the nation of Poland who should also come out like former Governor McGreevey of New Jersey and admit to being a gay American. Other homo-erotic acts were also performed by then private citizen George Bush because I performed one of them on him personally. \n\nI am the woman this website (bushssecretlifein84.tripod.com) speaks of that has been posted on the net nearly two years now. None of this would be the business of anyone but President Bush's little ruse to save his failed presidency by using DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] to divide Americans one from the other has to be exposed as the act of a desperate closeted homosexual man. The only crime in being GLBT is in the hiding. The President needs to come clean with the American people about his own past sexual behavior before he tries to besmirch the humanity of people in search of sincerely committing to the same bonds of matrimony he's afforded. He violated his own vows of monogamy having a homosexual affair with a long time family friend of whom his wife had no knowledge. His hypocrisy seems to know no bounds. \n\nI had planned to run for governor of Nevada without going into any of this but his planned nationally televised address to the nation makes it necessary for me to address his attempt at division in as public a way as he picked to try this Bushification of reality regarding same sex marriages.\n\nSincerely,\nLeola McConnell\nLiberal Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada\n --------------------------------------\nNow, aint this special!?",5819

She would have a sneezing attack when she finished eating a regular meal, but not when she snacked.  Specialists determined she had no food allergies, but was suffering from an anxiety disorder.  They determined it may have had something to do with felling ""guilty"" about eating.  It was a blessing in disguise; she was diagnosed as having a psychological eating disorder similar to bulemia.

They don't self-interact, that's why the electro-weak theory works so well... right?\n\nResponse to Dr. Bob's response:\n\nI agree that this process occurs (although a photon that decays into a e+e- pair has to be close to another mass so momentum can be transfered; isolated photons cant decay into e+e-).  But in such a case, would you really say that ""one light ray has bounced off another?"" I'd say that it was ""bouncing"" off the electron/positron pairs.  Just semantics I suppose.",5889

0,"Are there any other EKG techs out there? ; I work at one of the top cardiology hospitals in the nation as an EKG tech, but for some reason we are paid incredibly low. Are there any other EKG techs that will share how much they earn. ; I'm not an EKG tech, but I am a theatrical-lighting technician. Your question raises some of the interesting points I've seen in my own line of work. It seems that it is possible to get a paycheck for doing something with redeeming value (monitoring peoples' health or legitimate theater, for example). However, I have found in my business that so-called ""corporate theater"" (awards shows for fat-cats, fashion shows, etc.) pays substantially better. These events are merely so the already wealthy can pat each-other on the back and feel good about themselves. From an artistic or social standpoint it's gross. However, that's where the money is.\n\nI think that your situation underlines the fact that the people who do the most good (and I'm not putting any sort of theater into that category) are rarely compensated well for their efforts. I think one need look no further than how teachers are paid to see that this is true.\n\nI'm sorry. What you do is important and requires a skill-set that very few people have. I think it's a shame that the people who work behind the scenes, making sure that the engines that allow us to feel safe and secure are not treated fairly.\n\nI hesitate to say that ""we've lost sight of what's really important,"" as I don't think it's ever been any different, but I think that now, in the twenty-first century we have the perspective to change the way this system works.\n\nGood luck.",5894

Detox is a very hard thing to get through without help. It isn't like quiting smoking. If you are serious about quiting heroin I strongly suggest that you go to rehab.

5,"In baseball, where did the name homeplate come from? ; 1st base, 2nd base, 3rd base, home plate? So why did they name it homeplate instead of 4th base. ; I didn't, but I do now, courtesy of Skip McAfee, editor of the upcoming new edition of the definitive ""Dickson Baseball Dictionary."" It turns out that, in earliest days, home was actually a circular object, often a dish, which, naturally enough, led to it being called ""home plate."" Home went through various permutations in subsequent years -- a circular iron plate in 1845; a 12-inch square in 1869 with one point toward the pitcher; a square marble slab in 1872; a white rubber square in 1885 that reduced injuries to runners. The five-sided home plate we know today was adopted in 1900, as McAfree points out, ""to provide umpires with a better view to call balls and strikes and to provide pitchers with a larger target at which to aim. The five sides eliminated two corners and made the sides parallel.""",5914

1,"How astronomer measure the distance between galaxies? ; If a galaxy is 50 million light years from earth, it means it takes 50 years for light to travel from the galaxy to earth. How astronomer knows the light from a galaxy is 50 million years old? ; By the red shifts of the measurement. Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

1,"a fossil is the main or evidence of a living thing explain y fossils r rarely found igneous/metamorphic rocks? ; Scientists belive that very few if any, of the rocks presently on the earth's surface are old enough to have been there since the beginning of the earth approximately four and one half billion years ago.  If that is true, what must have happened to the original rocks? ; I will answer first the easy one. The oldest rocks are found in the pacific plate, the ones near the marianes trench, but their age is not 4.6 bya. Because old rocks return inside the earth through subduction zones. \nRefer to rock cycle.\nNew rocks are produce at the MOR (mid-oceanic ridges) and old ones are consumed at the subduction zones.\nThere are no very old rocks in continental crusts because they were weathered and eroded and brought to seas through rivers.\nNow about fossils. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks forms when sediments accumulates and cemented. Like lakes, and seas. Usually these place occur life. For example a leaf fall from a tree and left at the bottom of the river. Sediments pile over the leaf and thus preserved.\nIf lava piled over a life (like a leaf) the life or existence will burn and thus not preserved.\nFor fossil to occur it must be preserved. Its very difficult to preserved something if heat is involved.",5956

I can try Rue Care Oil that not only treat the hemorrhoids but also helps to straighten the veins and can be used for this purpose after the surgery to help hemorrhoids from re-appearing. Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

Do you think a jellyfish is a plant or an animal? Why?\n(Hint:Think about how plant cells and animal cells react when placed in a solution.)\n\nWhy does the jellyfish burst? ; This is an osmosis question; You are taking the jellyfish from its saltwater environment (Hypertonic) and placing it into a freshwater environment (Hypotonic.) The water rushes into the cells of the jellyfish to balance the mineral/water environment inside the cell and the cell membranes burst. If the jellyfish was a plant the cell could not burst because it would be contained within a cell wall; It would just become very rigid.,5983
9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

I am not for splitting up famillies.\n\nyour thoughts. ; I agree, amnesty and citizenship would be an expensive route.  The argument for having aliens make up a portion of our workforce has always been that they are taking the jobs that others do not want.  Why don't others want these jobs, partially because of the low wages.  As such the majority of Illegal aliens would qualify for government assistance if made citizens.  If all 11 million were to take this option and receive welfare the costs to taxpayers would be phenomenal.\n\nOne Item I would add to your list though is to tighten the rules, prosecute corporations that hire illegal aliens.

5,"Where was the first baseball game played? And Who Invented It? ; Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan. ; The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as ""The National Pastime"" or ""The National Game."" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that ""David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all—the Abner Doubleday–Cooperstown story.""

0,"isn't it obvious that God is real by now? ; please. ; Read this u'll know everything about God, u'll know whats real and whats obvious, whats the truth about God, i guarantee u\n\nWho is God?\nWho has been remembered as the Ocean of Love, the Intellect of the Wise, the Almighty Authority, the Comforter of Hearts, the Truth, The Living Being and the Blissful One?\nGod Says:\n I am the Ocean of Love; \nI show you the path of love. \nMy love remains unbroken and constant. \nI cannot forget even one of you. \nI have so much love for you,  \nand My love is unconditional and unlimited. \nI am the Beloved.You have been calling out to Me for a long time. \nWho Is God?\nWe are used to knowing things by seeing them, hearing them, tasting them, touching or smelling them. Most of us have grown up in a ‘seeing–is–believing’ and ‘hands on’ culture and we are used to perceiving things in that way. Because we can’t see, hear, taste, touch or smell God, the question arises – is God for real?\nOne can reach out to God with pure thoughts and be connected to Him. The soul experiences the response of pure feelings and spiritual strength. God is truth itself and thus can be recognized with the eye of truth.\nGod: The Supreme Soul\nLike us, God is also a soul. Unlike us, He is referred to as the Supreme Soul – the only soul who never takes a body (gross or subtle, human or angelic) of His own. He is beyond the effects of actions and is never subject to the dualities of birth and death, pleasure and pain, success and failure. Being beyond the limits of time of this physical world, He retains absolute knowledge of the universe and all its dimensions.\nWhere is God?\nGod lives, not everywhere but somewhere. A thought of God almost always takes the eyes upwards, as though one is perhaps expecting a face to miraculously appear from behind the clouds or to beam down from the moon. Thoughts are powerful. They link one soul to another. If they are properly channelled, thoughts can even go where only the soul can travel – beyond the moon and stars to a dimension of golden red light, the original home of all souls. Immersed in the experience of the warmth of this light, the soul feels as though it is truly at home at last, and with God.\nGod – The Spiritual Sun \nLike the physical sun, which gives light and life indiscriminately to all beings, God is the Spiritual Sun, giving light to all, whomever and wherever they may be. He serves altruistically, without any selfish motives, reminding each one of their innate qualities of love, peace and happiness. This is why He has been remembered in some countries and cultures by the name Shiva, The Benevolent One.\nGod’s Wisdom, Love and Power\nPeople may wonder why, if God exists, He doesn’t wave a magic wand and fix things, making or at least influencing everyone so that they do exactly what they ‘should’ do. But God never takes away anyone’s freedom of choice. God’s wisdom is to recognize and respect each soul’s individual identity, freedom and inherent goodness. God shares knowledge – a profound understanding of the dualities and dilemmas of love and hatred, happiness and sorrow, victory and defeat, etc. – but He does not make our choices for us. The soul is free to choose ‘to be or not to be’, ‘to love or not to love’. God’s love strengthens the soul’s will to free itself from the distresses caused by vices such as selfish desire, anger, fear, ego and attachment. God’s power helps the soul to recognize its highest potential and to aim for perfection by practising the art of simple living and high thinking. Such practice by a significant number of souls eventually brings about positive change in the whole of humanity.\nWhen you learn to tune your mind in meditation to the mind of God, then whatever the situation, you always have a source of help and strength to draw upon – an infinite reservoir of power and virtues that is only a thought away",6030

Some companies want to regulate or buget if you may all the ways you spend you money, and I don't want that. Just want to have my previous debts straightened out. Also, would you know of any other ways to raise your credit score? Thank you ; Snowball technique:\n\n1. Look at all old debts. Rank them from easiest to hardest to pay off based on total owed, minimum payment due, and (tiebreaker) highest interest rates.\n\n2. While making minimum payments to all other debts, pay this one, PLUS as much extra as you can swing- AT LEAST an extra 10%, but the more the better!\n\n3. As soon as this one is paid off, apply all of the payments you WERE making on it to the next debt in line, WHILE still paying the amount on it you were. By this time, you should be paying about twice the minimum so this one will go faster.\n\n4. Repeat for each other debt- the monthly payment will be getting bigger and bigger, paying it off faster and faster.\n\n5. Throw whatever 'windfalls' you can at this also- tax returns, bonuses, etc.\n\nThey say the snowball will get you debt free in the quickest amount of time- even faster than consolidation loans, etc. One nice thing about it is that YOU are in control of it. If you HAVE to hold back some of the extra money once, no big deal.\n\nPS- this is the technique that a lot of 'get out of debt quick, send money for info' schemes tell you to do.",6047

2,"whats the best cream or stuff to apply to get rid  pimples? ; any idea???? ; ways to get rid of pimples\n1. Don't pick, press, rub, or otherwise manipulate your pimples. If you do, you risk spreading the bacteria and increasing the chances of scarring.\n\n2. Use an over-the-counter product containing benzoyl peroxide once or twice a day. It helps break up the plug of dead skin cells, bacteria, and oil that clogs the pore and forms an acne blemish. And it cuts down on the bacteria, too. Start with the lowest concentration, and work your way up.\n\n3. Try over-the-counter products containing sulfur or resorcinol, which help unplug oil glands by irritating the skin. However, most dermatologists believe that benzoyl peroxide is the most effective over-the-counter ingredient for acne.\n\n4. Don't just spot-treat acne; put the product on acne-prone areas, too. That can include your entire face (avoid the lips and eyes), back, and chest.\n\n5. Go easy on your face. Washing removes oils from the surface of the skin, not from within the plugged ducts. In fact, if you're too aggressive in your quest for cleanliness, you may end up drying out or irritating the sensitive skin on your face.\n\n6. Wash properly once or twice a day, using a mild soap, and rub lightly with your fingertips and warm water. If your skin is oily, use a soap with benzoyl peroxide for its drying properties.\n\n7. Don't use brushes, rough sponges, cleansers with granules or walnut hulls, or anything similar on the delicate facial skin. \n\n8. Don't use oily products, such as hair pomades, heavy oil-based facial moisturizers, or oily cleansers.\n\n9. Use water-based make-up.\n\n10. Don't get a facial. You may end up doing more harm than good.\n\n11. Don't rest your chin on your hands or constantly touch your face.\n\n12. Protect your skin from cancer and wrinkles without aggravating your acne by choosing an oil- free sunscreen of SPF 15 or higher.\n\n13. Don't worry about what you eat, unless you notice a correlation between a particular food and your skin breaking out.\n\n14. Watch out for iodine, which can be found in multiple vitamins and iodized salt. Some doctors believe iodine may encourage acne.",6062

I don't like the dance themes that involve drugs, but ones that just simply involve listening & enjoying. ; Mainstream Dance in the U.S. in the Seventies was the Disco sound of artists like Donna Summer.  In the Eighties, Madonna defined a new sound with her Single ""Holiday"".  In the Nineties, the Dance/Pop of Paula Abdul, Sheena Easton, Belinda Carlisle, Taylor Dayne and others lost it's commercial appeal and Commerial Dance Music morphed into what it is today:  the Urban influenced sounds of Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.\n\nPersonally, I still like the DJ Remixes that went Commercial in the Nineties and are still going strong.

These are aggressive in nature because they are bacterial infections.  If you had an infection in the orbit (behind the eye), it most likely required surgical drainage.  If you had sinusitis and felt pressure in your eye (or both eyes), this does not mean you had infection in the eye, but is a common symptom of sinusitis.\n\nNerves do not typically get infected, and the vision change would probably either be blindness or a blind spot in your eye (same goes for the retina).\n\nVisual changes have lots of reasons, but your greatest risk is associated with the recent surgery in that eye.  There is even risk of some dangerous changes (causing a type of glaucoma) after surgery that should not be ignored.  You should see the ophthalmologist who did your cataract surgery or a different one (if you didn't like that one) to get examined.\n\nBest of luck!",6101

0,"Is it superstition? ; I know someone who always says ""Bless You"" when someone sneezes.  It is as if she HAS to say it.  What is going on with that?  Is she superstitious or is that part of her religion or what? ; It's an old superstition / nicety to say something like that from the days of ignorance of illnesses and when a sneeze could be the sign of something far more serious than a cold such as bubonic plague which ravaged Europe in 1665. It was thought that God would, somehow, cure you. Naturally this belief was fostered with the fact that if it was only a cold or tickly nose then the sneezer would eventually recover so, to people at that time, saying 'Bless You' would appear to be effective.At that time it was fashionable to carry nosegays, small handkerchiefs doused in perfume or wrapped around aromatic flowers, to disguise the terrible smells in towns where there were no sewer systems and rotten stuff and excrement littered the streets. Sneezing at such filth would be quite common.\n\nHowever like all superstitions it doesn't work and is now merely regarded as a courtesy. If your friend is so obsessed that she feels that she has to say it try two things. Firstly explain that all superstition is bunkum and is based on ignorance and stupidity. not fact and secondly offer yourself as a guinea pig to prove it.

Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined comment on the case.\nHouse Democrats, accusing GOP leaders of abusing the legislative process, have asked for another vote. On the last vote Feb. 1, the bill passed by the narrowest of margins, 216-214.\nThere is ample evidence to support the fact that Neocons attack Women, the poor and the elderly at every chance. ; A Bill is introduced in one House or another, if it passes it goes on to the other House, where they either pass the same version or more likely their own version of the Bill.  As both houses have to pass the same version of the same legislation it goes into committee of members of both house's who try to work out a compromise bill.  This is usually where all sorts of things get added to the bill that may have nothing to do with the bill in order to get both sides to agree on the bill.  At this point it goes before both houses again to be passed, if both houses pass the same version of the same bill it goes on to the President, however if any changes have been made between the two houses it goes to committee again.  This is how many pet project's or as it is called Pork Barrel Spending is created.  It is the same thing as the President spoke of as Earmarking in his State of the Union Address.

4,"Why are Macs not as popular as other PCs? ; Whenever I tell people that I am looking to buy a Macintosh Computer, they always give me grief and tell me that I am making a poor decision. I actually like Macs better. I just wondered why they are not as popular. ; I think if you looked at the percentage of Mac users who are enthusiastic about their machines, as opposed to the percentage of Windows users who are enthusiastic about their machines, you'd see a big difference in 'popularity!'  (Can ya tell I'm a Mac addict?!)  :D\n\nAnyway, the real issue goes back much farther than the other answerers suggest:  Right from the start, Apple kept tighter control over its OS and hardware technology, which was not the case for the PC world.  As a result, anybody & their dog was out there putting together hardware & software for Windows, with the freedom to do things their own way inside.  Back then more so than now, that meant much more competition (& lower prices,) but also meant that there were lots of compatibility issues with 'tricked out' PC systems.  Different peripheral vendors would do their own thing, & when you put the wrong two parts in the same machine, they would freak out the whole system.  Mac users simply didn't have that problem.  (Every now & then something would crop up, but not NEARLY to the extent that it did for the PC world.)  Still, enough users were looking primarily at the up-front savings, and lots of people did a minimum of customization, anyway.  All that allowed MS-DOS (which evolved to Windows) to build up a larger base of customers, and that momentum built on itself.\n\nIn most ways, Windows has finally (mostly) caught up with Macs in stability & usability.  And, Macs aren't as much more expensive than PCs as they used to be, either.  But, you won't see me giving up my Macs!  :)\n\nYou are not making a poor decision!  Go for it!",6165

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

Here is what I did, and maybe it will work for you...Up your cardio by an extra 15 minutes and hit the floor for some serious sit-ups. And don't forget to modify the number of carbohydrates and sweets you are eating. Sugar (from both sweets and fruit) turns into the same thing in your body as carbs, meaning that you have to be careful with how much of that sort of stuff you are eating. Cut out all white and enriched flours and starchy products. Toss in whole grain, not just whole wheat, and lay off the potatoes, if you can't give them up competely, substitute them with sweet potatoes, they have about half the carbs. I hope this helps!

Anyways, when it comes to sex, I'm more shy and he... let's just say he watches a lot a porn... so he wants to alway stry out these kinky things.  A lot of the time, it just goes straight against my character (not morals..kind.. how I act) and so I can never seem to feel comfortable pretending to be something I'm not.  I'm not totally against the idea, but I always tell him ""wait until we are older when we actually need that spark... ect"" and that I am not comfortable doing it, but he still demands it.  He even puts up certain dates for me to do it now... He will say ""Okay you haven't done ""x"" in a while, so do it by next week"".  It's really frustrating because I feel like I can't please him, and I kind of feel selfish for not doing what he wants (because trust me.. he gives me more than enough ""lovin"").  What should I do to feel more comfortable?? ; Actually, my dear, there is nothing that ""you"" should do...he is the one with the ""issue"". Sex is supposed to be fun, sex is supposed to be caring, sex is supposed to be sacred(and I mean doing things together that bring you closer, not thinking like this). I am frankly outraged that your boyfriend is acting...aherm...like such a jerk. \nNow don't get me wrong, I love getting ""kinky""...but my husband, not so much; not because he is prudish, or because he doesn't want to please me, but because he is not comfortable. You are 18, you should be having a good time, not worring about whether or not you're getting enough ""kink"" into your relationship with your apparently very immature boyfriend. \nAnd he is demanding that you do things...BAH...that is loathsome to me...it is one thing to request or suggest...maybe even ""dabble"" in the kinky to see if you both enjoy it...but if you don't enjoy it; that's it, game over...if you wish to try it again, it will be on your terms, not his...and watching a lot of porn is not an excuse.\nLet me give you the perfect example, and hopefully you'll see my point...I am very into bondage, my husband is more than happy to ""dish it"" but not much for taking it...so okay, I can work with that. I let my inner dominatrix out in other ways; but anyway, one nite he felt like exploring, so I tied him up. He did not like it, not one bit and kinky things usually had to deal with trust...so I let it go. A couple of nites later, he was willing to try it again, and so on and so forth. \nSo from my example hopefully you can see that what your boyfriend is doing is not ""adult""; it is the utmost in immaturity and a complete lack of understanding. Talk to him, frankly tell him I said so, a kinky woman that understands the rules in the adult playground...and if he doesn't get it; dump him. There are more fish in the sea than him...and probably better ones (if you know what I mean) than him as well. If you don't play by the rules, you're going to get flown off of the merry-go-round, and it's just that simple honey...so put on your big girl boots and lay down the rules for his little games...and if he breaks 'em; he's out...and somebody new can play ""red-rover"" with you.",6301

From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars. The victims of 9/11 have also embraced them. \n\nBelow are some links to some films that will enlighten you on the subject. \n\nWarning: if you have your mind made up that the government holds no responsibility whatsoever and if you unconditionally defend those in power despite overwhelming evidence that proves otherwise, don't bother clicking below.

Can anyone advise me as to how long I should go, or what its good for? ; The largest organ on the human body is skin. One of the most important jobs of skin is to rid our system of toxins which it does everytime you sweat. Sweating is vital to remaining healthy and most people do not do enough sweating in todays soft life to rid their systems of these toxins. Sauna's and steam rooms are a way to increase the amount of sweating. However I never spend more than 20-45 mins in one at a time, as you can overheat and pass out.",6309

8,"How do I seduce a prude and aggressive woman? ; There is this girl that I have only been around her 5 times already so I have known her recently. But from what I have seen in her is a strict, aggressive, proud and strong woman (18) with an amazing background and culture. And for me (18) we have had a mutual friendship relationship ( we are in a college club together, that's how we associate).\nWe tend to send mixed signals to on another but it does not seem obvious. When she talks, I listen to every single detail and go along the flow of conversation. Although sometimes I have to admit that when she talks, I get lost in her eyes which have mesmerized me and burn my heart on fire yet I keep my mouth shut and keep it mellow with her. I act like this because she keeps her behavior within the boundaries from society. Therfore I tend to show her moral behavior. Also very conservative with her beliefs so I enter her spirit by allowing her to open herself to me and teach me about herself. How do I seduce such energized woman? ; WOW you must be dating the girl that just broke up with me! So I will tell you what got me to be her boyfriend.... for a few days   8 (     She seems like the type of girl you have to fit, you cant fake. If you try to guess what she wants and emulate her perfect man and you arent... she will pick up on that and you will look dumb. But I would suggest break down her personality type. Hopefully you fit these. (ok starting off with that line probably makes u want to skip over my advice. I'm 22, she's 24 and looking for a husband in the near future. I didnt mess up in the courtship, She is moving far away very soon) but anyway...\n\nStrict - She wont like you giving her rules, but I believe her being strict means she likes order! This quality in girls is hard to deal with if you are a guy with low confidence. Dont second guess what you do. Either Do it 100% or don't. You don't want to seem out of ""order"".\n\nAggressive - What kind of aggressive? Assertive or actually Aggressive? Will she pursue a challenging goal? Or will she stand up to someone who tries to do her wrong? If she Is ""Assertive"" then that is a great thing, especially for you. A girl who is assertive wont play hard to get so much, because if she wants you she wont make it difficult for herself to have you. If she is aggressive in nature then you have to be aggressive. She is already confident in her own abilities to protect herself so Im sure she would want her man to do the same. And I dont mean physically I mean in general. You dont have to be confrontational about problems but you def cant let her see someone get over on you. You dont have to fight or anything, just make sure you take a stand.\n\nProud - A proud woman is a secure woman.\n\nStrong Woman - Ok so she is proud we get that. Accept the fact that she is in line with her femininity and doesn't see it as a weakness. So if you ever do something for her that would seem sexist. You can score a point or two by saying something like ""its not because your a woman, its because I'm a gentleman"" or something like that. Let her know that, yes you know she could have done it herself, but you wanted to do it for her.\n\nNow as far as the seduction goes. If you want her to be your girlfriend the attraction will build if you fit her type. Stick to your plans, dont be a flake. And be romantic all the time! Pursue pursue pursue, if you start dating, pursue some more. No girl wants to feel ""got"". Even if she is your girlfriend she wants to feel like you know that at any moment she could belong to someone else, so you are doing everything to show her how much she means to you! \n\nLastly respect yourself. Dont pursue her like a lap dog, be a man. She should know that at any moment you could be with someone else, but you know 100% that you want her and no one else matters. Dont look pathetic because u dont want to get used. She wants a man by her side. No man walks in front of his woman showing her off as a trophy, and no real man wants to walk in a woman's shadow being her boy toy. She wants her man at her side. If all else fails rent Hitch and watch it twice.\n\nIts a lot but it worked for me. I hope i didnt offend anyone though. Sorry if i did.",6319

0,"Jesus is lord who can dispute it ??? ; why the father of lies thats who. ; The Requirements for the Messiah and Christian Contradictions.\n\nA. Here is just a brief list of some of the requirements for the Messiah:\n\n(1) He must be Jewish (see Deut. 17:15; Numb. 24:17);\n(2) He must be descended from Judah (Gen. 49:10) and Solomon (numerous places, but see I Chron 22:9-10);\n(3) With the coming of the Messiah will be the physical ingathering of Judah from the four corners of the earth (Isa. 11:12, 27:12-13);\n(4) Also with coming of the Messiah will be the reestablishment of the Holy Temple (Micah 4:1);\n(5) In addition the Messianic age will be one of world-wide peace (Isa. 2:4, 11:6, Micah 4:3); and, finally,\n(6) In the Messianic age the entire world will believe in G-d (Isa. 11:9, 40:5; Zephaniah 3:9).\n\nB. Satisfying the Criteria -- the Geneology Problem\n\nEven if Christians could establish that (a) Jesus existed and (b) Jesus was Jewish, they would have trouble proving that (c) Jesus was descended from Judah and Solomon. Both of the detailed geneologies in Matthew and Luke trace Joseph's lineage to King David, albeit differently since Matt. 1:16 says that a fellow named Jacob was Jospeph's father, and Luke 3:23 tells us that Joseph was the son of Eli. (It seems that that family had a lot of problems determining fatherhood.) But these geneologies are bogus because Matthew tells us that Joseph wasn't the father of Jesus, but Mary was still a virgin even after he was conceived through the ""Holy Spirit""! Matt. 1:18. Since we know that geneology runs from the father (Numbers 1:18; 2:2), Jesus cannot claim descendency from Judah.\n\nC. No Messianic Era.\n\nEven still, Christians still have a problem because they still can't establish points 3, 4, 5, or 6 in paragraph A, above. Saying that those events will happen in a Second coming is circular at best and contradicts Revelations 22:20 (""Yes, I am coming quickly."")\n\n\n  \nAbuse and Misquotes of the Hebrew Bible\n\nA. Isaiah 53. Who Was the ""Suffering Servant""?\n\nMissionaries commonly Isaiah 53 as a proof text that the Messiah will suffer for the people's sins. E.g.:\n\n""(3)He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with sickness; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not:\n(4)Surely he has borne our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted:\n(5)But he was wounded because of our transgressions, he was bruised because of our iniquities; his sufferings were that we might have peace; and by his injury we are healed:\n(6)All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all:\n(7)He was oppressed, but he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep, that is dumb before its shearers, he did not open his mouth:\n(8)By oppression and false judgment was he taken away; and of his generation who considered? For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people:\n(9)And they made his grave among the wicked, and his tomb among the rich; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth:""\n\nOn its face it sounds convincing in retrospect knowing what we know about Jesus from the NT only. But, who is the ""he"" referred to in the verses? Let's trace it back a few lines to the previous chapter (52), where the discussion of what ""he"" will do begins. At 52:13 it appears to begin with ""Behold, my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.""\n\nOK, so now we know that ""he"" is G-d's ""servant."" But who is G-d's ""servant""? Let's trace our steps a little further. In Isaiah 41:8 the question is answered: ""But Israel is my servant."" The next line, Isaiah 41:9, adds some more: ""You are ",6366

Like I said, I know he won't cheat on me, but females in general just irratate me when it comes to him.  I don't know what to do.  I've talked to him about this, but I just can't seem to kick this jealousy thing.  Can anybody help me? ; This is tough.  Part of it is that you sound insecure.  You say he won't cheat but you don't seem to believe it.  Trust is hard sometimes.\n\nAll of us guys look at other girls (sorry it's true, we just don't act on it).  I wouldn't look at another girl when I'm with my girlfriend because I wouldn't want her to feel bad.  \n\nHe may like the attention of other girls because it makes him feel attractive. But he's not making you feel secure, making you feel like the only one so there is a problem.\n\nMost people do get jealous.  Try to have more trust him and believe that in yourself more that he wants to be with you.\nAs long as nothing is going on he should be allow to have girl's who are friends same as you are allowed to have guys who are friends.  Now if one tried to kiss him...than snap all means ;-)",6373

Pros:  working with books and seeing what was new before everyone else; seeing books that I never thought of while shelving; meeting new people while working there and having them recognize me everytime they came into the store; having (for the most part) really great co-workers\nCons:  Standing on your feet all day, getting papercuts when shelving (yes you are tempted to look through books and are allowed to as long as you get everything done lol), getting in the habit of straightening books like they have them in the store...I still find myself going into Barnes and Noble and if they aren't done like how I was trained, I find myself straightening them or putting them back where they belong lol, holiday rushes at the cash stand...talk about feeling pressured, shelving duties meant we had to be there at 7:30am before the store opened which was okay but some mornings that was really hard and you just wanted to sleep in.  I was sorry to have to leave but they cut out the shelving department at my store so I was let go.  If I hear of the store near me here in Atlanta hiring, I may try for a part-time job here as I loved it so much.

Some of these have 'real time' measurement capabilities, which means you can go to the USGS website right now and get the actual water level measurement for a prticular well in their database. \n\nWhat typically happens is\n1) you go to a well with a tape measure and record the level of the water from the ground surface.

Make sure when you give her orange juice she has something in her tummy so that the acid doesn't burn the lining of her stomach. \n Getting phlegm stuck in her throat like that is a sign of dehydration, she's not drinking enough fluids. If you find that you can't make her drink more water then I would make the small amount of fluids she does drink make more of a difference. Try giving her Gatorade, orange juice, 7-Up, and Pedialyte when she's thirsty. All those liquids will help balance the electrolytes in her body, keeping better hydrated and her bodily functions working better. \nWhen she starts coughing try giving her peppermints to suck on, the peppermint settles her stomach, makes her throat slick (making it easier to cough phlegm up), and the peppermint oil will help loosen up her sinuses.\nI hope she feels better soon.",6423

Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

That is one of the reasons fiber is good for helping people feel full longer and it is reccommended for those trying to lose weight to eat lots of food full of fiber. Fiber also is great for the digestive tract as it helps keep it clean, due to the fiber pushing out other foods. \n\nBeef is not very high in fiber. In fact, I don't think beef has any fiber at all.

How can the family of the lw or gp win the right to gain all of the the lw's or gp's belongings?

But unless the partner is a ""civil partner"" or equivalent, that wouldn't gain him or her any rights.\n\nAll the more reason why wills should be carefully drawn up by lawyers, and when a contest is likely or possible, videotaped.\n\nAnybody can contest a will, but a contest won't go anywhere if the will was properly drawn up, there was love and affection (if not a blood relationship) or charitable intent (if to a charity), and so on. Proving undue influence is difficult -- even when it exists. With videotape evidence, it's virtually impossible.\n\nAs for Diadem's comment: wills aren't notarized in the USA except in Louisiana. In some states (New York comes to mind) the attestation clause of the witnesses may optionally be notarized and this may save tracking the witnesses down at the time of probate.)\n\nSpecial rules apply to holographic wills (handwritten and not witnessed) which are valid in some jurisdictions; sometimes only if written on a battlefield.

3,"What's the best way to start a summary on a book report? ; No I'm not asking anyone to WRITE the report, I always just have trouble starting summaries. ; I'm glad you asked. 1) While you read - you should be maintaining an outline of the facts on each chapter. 2) Make note of characters, characterization (little tidbits the author reveals, and the ones you find as you read) 3) Construct a story map and note how the story moves from the exposition-to the rising action-climax-falling action and then resolution. 4) Note what your thoughts are about each character, and how they relate.  After your review your outline, go back and read it. Now you should be able to draw an intro statement based on a number of things you have discovered about the storyline, characters, plot, theme, etc.  One or two items should stick out.  For example- if the protagonist (main character) is driving the story, then trace how he/she does that and how they effect the outcome.  A good summary to me is the student who evaluates many sides of the story from different perspectives. Make it brief, you don't want to reveal ""all of the good stuff"", but as the reader and writer - your outline should have more information so that if you need to return and do more essay writing, you have the facts with you.

1,"evaluating pulsed signal bandwidths? ; The Sine(x)/x curve shows that for a pulsed signal the bandwidths are based on the inverse of the PD.

I'm assuming this is only because the requirement to accurately represent the rise/fall times. (don't have time to waste) Is this correct, or is there some other reason I'm not seeing? ; There is another interesting notion.  Dr. Robert Moog, inventor of the musical synthesizer bearing his name, pointed out in a discussion of it that it attempts to duplicate the characteristics of the various musical instruments.  For example, he pointed out that if a trombone player (like me) wants to hit a high note, a sharp attack on the note will lend more of the available energy to the upper harmonics.  If all the harmonics are present, it may then be very important which harmonics are most energetic.  The difference between the distinctive sounds of a clarinet and a sax is in part due to the emphasis or de-emphasis of certain harmonics (odd or even), etc. because the instruments are respectively cylinders and cones.",6478

1,"Does Hair Dye Affect microscopic characteristics of human hair? ; I'm doing this for my science fair project and i need help\n\n------ BIO experts help me\n\nwhat should I look for or examine \n\ncell membrane?\n\nHelp plase\n\nwhat 3 different criterias should i evaluate and test? ; I'm not a bio expert, but as a licensed cosmetologist, I can tell you that dye does affect microscopic characteristics of hair, because the permanent dyes are a mixture of color molecules in an ammonia base, which is mixed with developer, H2O2, or 20 volume hydrogen peroxide, just before application. The H202 lifts the cuticle of the hair, which is the overlapping scales on the outside of the hair shaft, and removes some of the natural pigment (bleaches a bit) from the cortex, and the mixture then deposits the new artificial color molecules into the cortex. The medulla, or innermost layer of the hair, is not usually affected, but in cases of severe chemical damage, it can be. The hair shaft itself sort of resembles a tree under a microscope, the outer layer, the cuticle, resembles ""bark"" or overlapping scales, the cortex resembles the ""pith"" of a tree or plant stem, and the medulla is a very thin ""core"" in the center. You'll see ""damage"" to the hair shaft of dyed hair, as those cuticle scales have been lifted, and some become missing from the chemical damage.  The difference between dyes, is a permanent color (dye) removes natural color, and re-deposits new color, a semi-permanent color does not mix with H202, and ""stains"" the outer layers of the hair, and washes off after several shampoos. There can be no temporary lightening of hair with a semi-permanent color, because in order to go to lighter hair, the natural pigments must be removed, and that takes peroxide / ammonia based products. \nI hope someone with more of a chemistry / biology background can fill in the details for you, but I hope I have at least given you an understanding of how hair is changed by dyes.  (similar changes / damage occur with perms and straighteners) Good Luck.",6486

With rugby on the other hand most of the contact will be experienced in the upper body - the training builds up the upper body to take the hits. Probably since there is more 'flesh' (muscle & bulk) on the upper body the degree & frequency of contact that can be sustained would be greater than around the ankles & shins. \nThe rolling around bit by the footbal players is probably due to the fact that in todays football/soccer games it is that hard to score a goal due to the high level of skill, any advantage gained will be a bonus.\nWith rugby union now being a fully professional sport, increased speed & fitness combined with the large number of games being played I think injuries will be more common place. What you will notice is that due to the reasons just mentioned before, the retirement age of the rugby players will decrease, remember Paul Rendel 'The Judge' played international rugby for England in the 1980's at the age of 36 - it will be unlikely that players will represent their country at an international level at such an age in future.",6526

Jones-Drew  @     Buf\nW. Dunn           vs.     NO\n\n\nI'm leaning on Henry and Jones-Drew right now.   Give me your thoughts. ; I would start Travis Henry he has been amazing for the past couple of weeks, 107 yards against the Ravens D and a score, and 143 yards and a score against the Eagles D. I think he will get over 100 yards and a score against the Giants D. Buffalo Defense allows over 128 yards a game and 20 points so I would start Maurice Drew Jones vs the defense he will score once at least and get over 70 yards. Don't start Alexander against the Packers D becuz the only give up 99 yards a game so I think he wouldn't do good against them. NO gives up over 120 yards a game on the ground but Vick takes half of Dunn's carries away from him and Norwood gets a little so it wouldn't be smart to start him becuz of Vick.",6541

His SED rate is still 120 after about 5 weeks. What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about. Yes blood work is getting done to make sure his van levels are ok. Can not re-culture the site of infection. It was or is in his back, they will be taking out the staples tomorrow. So the wound will be closed up. I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone. He feels good no apparent sign of infection. Red cells are a little low, white cells are good. His iron is down. Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.",6548

And a power source for all those parts requiring an electrical impulse.  \nThe procedures used usually try to remove power from the overall device, if that is not possible, try to prevent the electrical impulse from making it to the trigger or detonator.

I have heard they are holding facilities for Mexicans in case of a mass exodus. I have also heard they are quarantine facilities for future bird flu victims.  Neather of these reasons explain  why these camps have gas chambers.  It looks like our government is planning to kill some people.  ""If you are not for us, you are against us.""  \n\nI hope that Pres. G.W. Bush is not planning to follow up on his grandfather's plan.\n\nJohn Buchanan (investigative Journalist) searched through the U.S. National Archives and The Library of Congress. What he found, he calls, proof that Prescott Bush (Pres. G.W. Bush's grandfather) was a Nazi supporter who should have been tried for Treason.\n\nAccording to the McCormack Dickstein Committee of Nov. 1934; Prescott Bush, The DuPont Family, The Remington Family, and J.P. Morgan tried to overthrow the U.S. Government by trying to assassinate Pres. F.D.R.: Their goal was to put a Hitler style fascist state in place.\n\nThey planned to use Hitler's Nazi model to impose Marshal Law, on the United States: Then planned to roundup the unemployed, trouble makers, and Jews and put them into internment camps.

6,"Hi my name is Leona and I am looking to invest in a home base business without spams any suggestions, Help? ; I will becoming into a couple of dollars soon, and i'm looking to invest in a homebase business, reason being i need a home and the feeling of never being without and not having to answer to anyone but myself. ; My first question would be do you have any business experience. I ask because just to say I want to run a business is one thing and to actually do it is something else.\n\nSo I you do have the business experience and savvy and a couple of thousands to invest then check out and research the various types of franchises out there and see which one suits you. Entrepreneur magazine and others of this type should lead you in the right direction.\n\nIf you do not have ""running a business"" experience then let me recommend what a lot experts have been saying. Get into Network Marketing. The reasons being are:\n\n1- The Training - The good companies work with organization who will help you develop you knowledge in all aspects of your business and you before the product or service. This means time and energy will be invested on developing you and a person and business-owner vs pushing you to move products.  Not to say that you shouldn't be moving products, that's why you're in business. \n\n2- Developing a Network - In order to have a strong and prosperous business you need repeat business. These organizations of  business owners will help you in the developing strong networks so that your business keeps moving forward.\n\n3- Global Opportunities - No more do you have to limit your self to just you neighborhood  with the advent of the Internet you now have access to a global marketplace. The larger companies and organizations can help you in expanding you business into the international arena if the opportunity arises for you.\n\n4- Low Risk - Most companies have a low start-up investment\nwhich means that you can work it on a part-time level until you are making enough to go full-time. So you don't have to quit your job or quit school. Also the highly reputable ones have a money-back guarantee.\n\nPoints -\n1- You may of heard for people failing to succeed in this type of business most of it is attributed to  some people fail to treat it like a business. \n\n2-A business is a business and you won't get anything out of it if you don't put anything in it.\n\n3- As a very wealthy man once told me ""Check the fruit on the tree"". Be careful of who you take advice from, check the fruit on their tree. Are they where you want to be or are they even going in that direction. \n\n\nSo keep up in doing your research and the best is yet to come.\n\n\nMy recommendation is Quixtar. They're a 6-billion dollar company. I've dealt with some of the people before. Lovely people. What I like is that they have a wide variety of products and services to offer so a person is not limited to just one or two things. Also they also seem to be on the cutting edge of product technology. Let them help you get in contact with someone in your area who can help you.",6618

I didn't apply for it but I like the job now if she would stop criticizing me.  She is new but she works 40 hrs week so has more opportunity to learn compared to my 8 hours.  What can I do? ; It's sad, but a lot of people seem to have Dragon Lady bosses, tho men can be just as bad.  A lot of people simply don't know how to be supervisors--they know how to do a job so they get promoted, but they don't get trained in how to supervise anyone else.  Maybe part of the dynamic is that you're a tiny person and she's bigger than you so she may be throwing her weight around without knowing it. (No pun intended.)  If it were me, I'd meet with her privately to explain how I felt and how she could best help me, and what she expected of me.  If that didn't work, I'd try to meet with her boss, privately, to see how the boss thought it could be handled from that point.

1,"What is H.E.P. and how does it differ from Particle Physics? ; What does a High Energy Physicist do and how does it differ from a Particle Physicist? And are the only two places they can work is in a University or a Particle Accelerator? ; Particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them. It is also called ""high energy physics"", because many elementary particles do not occur under normal circumstances in nature, but can be created and detected during energetic collisions of other particles, as is done in particle accelerators.\n\nResearch work certainly requires a particle accelerator, which can be found in both university and private environments. (see link for lists).  There is also a huge body of work in public policy, to expand the research arena, and theory, devising potential projects for the researchers.\n\nSo, H.E.P (high energy physics) and particle physics are essentially the same thing.  A physicist specializing in this area can work in areas other than universities and particle accelerators.\n\nGreat Question!  I learned something new!!",6628

I'm also more interested in British/European e.g.s than all those crazy Americans ;) ; The precedent set by the Crown vs Tony Martin was unclear, but the gist of it is... If you can convince a Jury that you had reason to believe your life is in danger, then lethal force is justified.\n\nIf you respond to a shove with a punch then that is what the police classify as a ""Fray"" and both parties are basically consenting participants in violence, and are both equally responsible.\n\nIf property is involved or threatened then the ""victim"" is usually considered to be in the right, but witnesses will be required unless there is little room for doubt (ie if property was actualy stolen).\n\nThe old adage ""Property is 9/10ths of the law"" is acually true!",6646

If we are going to purchase this house any time soon (our lease goes up October 1st) it will have to be in my name since I have credit and he does not.\nMy idea is (if I can get pre-approved) that we should go ahead and get the house in my name and put the utilities in his name while he builds credit. Once he has credit built up and/or we are married, we will refinance to put the house in both of our names.\nHis idea is to wait to buy a house until he has established credit.

Is this still for today's Christians or was it just for the early church congregations.  Did the 'gifts of the Spirit' terminate somewhere in history or are they still appropriate today?

She has money but I can't use it or ask for any. I work and pay the bills, so my money is always gone. I am in no ways a wimp. I try to keep peace for my kids. and even they can see how its affecting me. ; You need to sit down and talk to her - be honest with her.  If you both make money, both of your salaries should be used to pay the bills - not just yours.  The fact that she won't let you call your family is ridiculous.  Tell her that you feel your relationship has some issues and you would like to get into counseling.  It sounds like you might have better luck getting into counseling and letting a counselor help you both work on your marriage - and also work on these crazy issues your wife seems to have. \nIn the meantime, talk to her, get into counseling, and get yourself a cell phone.  Most cell phone plans include free long distance and the plans are reasonable - and with your cell you can call your family/friends until you can get this whole crazy wife not letting you use the phone thing figured out.  Without a shadow of doubt you should definitley seek out a counselor - not for you but for her.

You can only balance your check book when you consider what other monies are being taken out of that account. Additionally, money drawn out from that account may not be removed the same day as the tramsaction. Add to that the complications of interest payments and funds coming into the account and transaction fees and you will end up with a headache.\n\nI suggest you either use your statements to balance your account (even better with software such as Quicken or even Excel) or you use online banking, which is always right (as of close of last business day) even if you can't figure out why.",6692

If you are eating ANY kind of fatty foods, you are simply pouring gasoline on that fire.  Also, have they given you any other tests such as an ERCP, Endoscope, Colonoscopy, Upper GI, Lower GI or maybe even an MRI?  I just recently spent 14 days in the hospital getting regular doses of pain and nausea medication and had all of these test ran.  Luckily I do not have Pancreatitis, but I do have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is also diet related (lack of fiber usually); also there is a disease known as Crones Disease that have the same type of symptoms.

It requires meeting a lot of people & a lot of knocking on strangers doors. I'd start with auto parts stores.  Also, we have made some deals with our favorite resturants & companies that we work for.  It helps to put together a portfolio about yourself & your racing achivements.

0,"Bored = Afraid of Hindus or Buddhists? ; I dont fear any people of faith.  Spirituality, like someone said is entirely different.  Spiritual people's beliefs, from what ive encountered, are overwhelmingly positive and personal, as opposed to half positive, sometimes disgustingly negative.  Buddhists i think have far more sensible and positive beliefs than christians, i think eastern 'religions' are intriguing and to be learned from.  I cant say that i dont like all christians, i dont know them all, i dont like what they believe.  Dont pray for me, instead smoke a blunt for me, at least do something that accomplishes something.  If anyone cares, my belief system is very simple;  if there is a god, he will not punish me or anyone else for that matter in any way.  Beyond that big IF, i believe that i dont know, and i wont pretend to.  But i will constantly question, and never accept blindly the assertions of people who know just as little as i do.  Religion WISHES to impose its VERY conservative positions into everyones life. ; For thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry. God is not like a father in a patriarchal society, who has His favorite children to whom He communicates. This idea seems rather archaic and crude. Hinduism believes in behavior than belief and  experience over authority. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, Prophetic religion is severe, militant, uncompromising, intolerant, while mystic religions are renouncing, and peaceful. \n\nThere is no need to be afraid of world's most tolerant, religion wich never persecuted nor attcked any country in name of religion .\n\nBored?? The vast collection of Hidu philosophy is fascinating and colourfull. No one can ever be bored . \n\nIn fact it will improve your understanding of mysticism even in christianity.It is a collection of wisdom of innemerable sages are missing out a great deal.\n\nThe Hindu religious system can be divided into two major systems. The Orthodox system (called astika in Sanskrit) accepts the authority of the Vedas.\n\n1. Sankhya - founder Sage Kapila\n2. Yoga  -  Sage Patanjali\n3. Mimamsa  - Sage Vyasa / Sage Jaimini\n4. Vedanta  - Shankaracharya, Ramanuja/Chaitanya/ Madhava/Vallabha\n5. Nyaya  - Sage Gautama (not Buddha)\n6. Vaisheshika - Sage Kanda\n\nThe Heterdox (Nastika) system rejects the authority of the Vedas. This system includes Carvaka (materialism), Jainism, and Buddhism. The Carvaka system denies existence of the individual self(atman) apart from the body and rejects the notion of moksha (salvation) for the atman\n\nWisdom of Geeta is a class apart.\n\nHinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of worship. When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. For it is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. Thus, it becomes a kind of social idolatry. Highly individualistic, Hindus have always resisted any regimentation of thought.\n\nRegarding mothermulesmeals' post:\n\n I am glad I am not one of her friends at whom she is  always preaching Jesus  !!! It only shows their maturity and her own childish ignorance.\n\nReally she takes advantage of their being tolerance in it. She seems to be blissfully ignorant how irritating it is. Or may be she does not care about it in her zeal.\n\nHow would she feel if they start telling her how immature, egoistic and narrow , is the idea that God asked everyone to follow Jesus !\n\nGod does not his favourite children. Religion is an experience. To think that any human being or institution has the monopoly of God's truth is to commit the sin of pride.",6701
6,"What are some good credit cards for credit repair that AREN'T scams? ; I've never had a credit card (although my credit sucks) and heard they're a great way to repair credit. Any tips? ; First all, if you're trying to repair your credit, the APR shouldn't matter because if you're really committed you will pay off all bills in full every month!\n\nTry the credit cards offered by your bank first. Banks have a soft-spot for their customers and that can be a positive factor in their credit approval.\n\nNext, look at cards offered by Chase, CapitalOne or Citibank.  These are reputable company.\n\nOrchard Bank should never be a choice if you're building credit. In my opinion, their lending practices border on predatory. Fees are outrageous, and they are not very good at disclosing hidden ones.\n\nIf your credit is as bad as your say, be prepared.  \n    You may be denied.   \n    You may be offered a secured credit card.\n    You may be offered a credit card with a higher rate.  \n\nIf you're denied for credit, don't keep trying. Wait for at least 6 months before you try again. When you apply for a credit card, the lender will get your credit report. The more you apply for credit, the lower your score can get and less like you are to be approved for credit.\n\nVicious cycle, right?\n\nIf the credit card has a high APR, consider accepting the card.  The high APR will only affect you if you carry a balance at the end of each statement cycle.  BUT pay off everything when the bill comes. \n\nIf you do this, you won't see your credit improve right away.  It may takes anywhere from 1-7 years to repair your credit.\n\nIf you were offered a secured credit card, think twice. Lenders don't just look at your credit score or whether you have a good repayment history. They also look at the type of credit lines you have.",6702

1,"What percentage of people are homosexual? ; I've heard anywhere from one to ten percent and i'm curious which is more accurate. Please send me links to any publication that deals with this issue. I am looking for a credible source here. Thanks. ; Ten percent is probably a huge exaggeration, though it somehow became the standard figure for a while. This may date back to the 1950s, when Alfred Kinsey published his books about sexuality. Because many people who didn't identify as homosexual had had homosexual experiences nonetheless, some people read these data and concluded exclusive homosexuality was much more common than it probably is.\n\nThere are SO many variables involved in determining the underlying conditions behind your very good question. Gender identity is so fluid and flexible that people don't always fit easily into categories ""homosexual,"" ""heterosexual,"" ""bisexual,"" and the like. \n\nAnother complication is that, although you ask the question very broadly, a given percentage of any specific population - a self-selected or self-identified one, for example = won't necessarily have a constant statistical proportion of people of any given sexuality represented within it. And variables that may not seem to correlate at all with sexual behavior of the members of a group may be better determinants of what those people identify themselves as. \n\nIn some cultures, the concept of ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" in the Western European & American senses of those terms don't really exist. Other social constructions of same-sex relationships under different conditions, with rituals, subdialects, and patterns of secrecy exist that it would be unfair to characterize in the same terms that we use in the West.\n\nSo, I haven't given you a percentage, but I hope this helps a little.\n\nBy the way, I'm about 90% gay myself. The other ten percent vacillates between being curious and being sleepy.",6711

5,"Should Barry Bonds be allowed to keep playing baseball? ; With all the signs that he has used steriods, why is he allowed to keep playing and chasing Babe Ruth's and Henry Aaron""s records. And don't play the rascist cards. Aaron was a true gentleman, Ruth was flambouyant but also a good man. and neither used steroids. Bonds is a jerk to fans and has the same condesending attitude that many current day atheletes have. ; Absolutely. Baseball has never proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that Bonds has knowingly taken any performance-enhancing drugs. Yes, most signs point to the fact that he has, but he has never failed a drug test.\n\nUnfortunately for the sport and for the fans, baseball and the players association didn't implement a careful, thorough drug testing and penalty process until very recently. So lots of records over the past decade or so that may or may not be tainted with drug use will always have an implied asterisk next to them.\n\nAlso, the truth is that cheating has been a part of the game since the beginning. Corked bats, scuffed balls, amphetamine use, etc. have always been around and fans and baseball have looked the other way.",6743

Is he not attracted to me, or what. ; I think it's the oppisite of what you may think it is.\n\nYou said that he's grabbing your butt, I doubt that that would mean that he doesn't find you attractive. I think it's obvious that he does. \n\nI think that it's possible that he is interested in having sex with you, but doesn't want to interrupt your sleep by waking you up and then feels embarrassed because he doesn't want you to catch him doing the most personal intimate thing you can do with yourself.\n\nMy boyfriend has done this to. I asked him about it and he said that he does it because he doesn't want to disturb my sleep. He also said that sometimes he does it, because it's the only time he gets to only think of himself, but that it didn't mean he wasn't ""into"" me, just an opportunity to be selfish, because he usually (always) puts my needs first before his own.\n\nWe all know that men think differently than we do, and they don't always openly communicate their feelings.\n\nYou should talk to him about it, especially if this is something that really bothers you.

Ask me he really needs to choose not between you and his child but you and his baby's mom. Baby mom is acting like a real bitch.

1,"Did time begin with the so called ""Big Bang"",  or did the Big Bang occur at some point in time? ; I'm just facinated with the concept of time especially it's beginning and end.  Do you think time can be thought of in terms of a straight line or is it a circle.  No beginning and no end. ; By definition, the big-bang is the beginning of the known universe; that is to say: everything that can be known is from after the big-bang. And so, implicitly your question is answered – time started with the big-bang, simply because we can not find any proof of it’s existence before. (I know, it is a little confusing.)\n\nAs to time’s linearity –\nI’ll start with a different difficult concept – infinity. \nDraw a square grid. Stretch it to infinity. ALL of its edges are now at infinity. In any direction you choose to move, you will eventually reach infinity. The same word describes your location no matter where you are. If all these places are denoted by one word-symbol-number, than all these places are one!\nGauss was first to visualize this: take your infinite grid and wrap it around a sphere with a radius of one that rests at its origin. The point (0,0) would become a southern pole, the point we called infinity would become the northern pole. \nAny infinite straight line would become a circle when drawn on this sphere grid. \n\nNow I’ll give you back your question: what do you think is the shape of the time line?",6764

Exercising WHILE you have the cramps only makes them worse-- trust me, I had that problem when I was 18 (at first the doc thought it might be a cyst, but then I just started working out all the time because of a school activity, and I am 21 now, still work out regularly, haven't had them since).  And you said cheaply-- exercise is free!\n\nBut speaking of cysts, it could be one of those.  My friend's sister had killer cramps, and it turned out that a cyst was the reason.

5,"What is the top scuba gear for 2005 for the following items...? ; Mask\nFins\nTorch\nWetsuit\nRegulator\nOther gadgets worth mentioning? ; A mask is all about the fit.  A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.  My preference is the Apollo bio fins although there are many excellent choices out there.\n\nIn terms of torch, I think that depends on your application.  I like the Ikelite PCA, the UK SL4 and the small UK pocket light.  These would work for tropical night diving.  Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.  I really like the scubapros but there are *many* great choices.

1,"Multiply 4 2/7x8/11=? ; Please help, not with just the answer explain how to do this. I am not good with fractions at all. ; To multiply fractions, fundamentally the answer is the product of the numerators (top numbers) divided by the product of the denominators (bottom numbers).  For example,\n\n(2/3) * (3/7) = (2*3)/(3*7) = 6/21\n\nWhen any of the fractions contain whole parts such as the ""4"" in your problem, it does slightly complicate it.  Let me show you 2 slightly different ways to deal with this situation, you pick the one you like:\n\nYour problem can be rewritten as\n\n(4 + 2/7)*(8/11) =\n\n[4 * (8/11)] + [(2/7) * (8/11)] =\n\n(32/11) + (16/77) =\n\n224/77 + 16/77 =\n\n240/77\n\nOr you can do this shortcut, which converts the ""4"" to ""elevenths"" - multiple it (the ""4"") by the denominator (7) then add the numerator (2).  4*7 = 28, plus 2 = 30.  This will be your new numerator.  Now the problem looks like:\n\n(30/7) * (8/11) =\n\n(30 * 8)/(7*11) =\n\n240/77\n\nGet it?",6795

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

1,"Does the full moon affect the speed of the earth's rotation? ; Can the moon's effect on gravity and tides vary or affect the speed of the earth's rotation i.e. speed it up/slow it down ever so slightly during monthly moon phases? If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time. Of all of these Stephen Hawking's were the easiest for me to understand and the most interesting to read.  You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.  The visible phases of the moon would still have nothing to do with the affect on time however.  \n\nThat was an interesting question, I hope my answer was of some use to you!\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus\n*thanks for correcting me on the orbital change Answer Guy.",6806

But they wont mean anything to you, because you are now a Christian, and no longer a Jew, IF you ever were one......\n----------\nObviously, for a ""Jewish man,"" you know little of the Bible or of Judaism or of Gd.\n\nPLEASE look at the following::\nhttp://WhatJewsBelieve.org\nhttp://Convert.org \n\nThe basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says, and so Real Jews cannot believe in Jesus at all.\n\nThe Christian understanding is that the Messiah, Jesus, died for the sins of the people. The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.\n\nBut we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another. In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this:\n\nDeuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not \nbe put to death for the children, neither \nshall the children be put to death for\nthe fathers: \nevery man shall be put to death for his \nown sin (eesh b’chet-o yumatu).\n\nIn Exodus 32:30-35, Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people. To be written out of Gd's book, means to be written out of the Book of Life, which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People. Gd's response is No, it does not work that way, each man dies for his own sin:\n\nExodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the \nmorrow, that Moses said unto the people, \nYe have sinned a great sin: and now I will \ngo up unto the Etrnl; perhaps I shall make \nan atonement for your sin. And Moses \nreturned unto the Etrnl, and said, Oh, \nthis people have sinned a great sin, and \nhave made them gods of gold. Yet now, if \nthou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, \nblot me, I pray thee, out of thy book \nwhich thou hast written. And the Etrnl \nsaid unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned \nagainst me, him will I blot out of my \nbook. \n\nThe whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea, that no one can die for someone else's sin. Further, this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd will forgive us.\n\nSo, the Bible is clear, no one can die for the sins of another, and this means that Jesus cannot die for anyone else's sins.\n\nChristians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin, that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins, and go to hell, except for the sacrifice of Jesus.\n\nThis, too, is UnBiblical. The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus. But it is in Leviticus itself, in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices, that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins. Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal. Was forgiveness then, to be only for the rich? No, because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour, which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice, and Gd forgave them!\n\nLeviticus 5:11-13; But if he be not able to \nbring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, \nthen he that sinned shall bring for his \noffering the tenth part of an ephah of fine \nflour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil \nupon it, neither shall he put any \nfrankincense thereon: for it is a sin \noffering.\n\nFurthermore, read the Book of Jonah. In Jonah, the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd. They fast, they pray for forgiveness, and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd forgave them! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur, we fast, we pray for forgiveness, and, h",6811

6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds.

5,"Whats a good first upgrade 4 a BMX bike? ; Well i just bought my first BMX bike. I got a Haro F2 because the price was practical for my first bike and it seemed to be pretty good bike. Anyway it is a little heavy, compared to one of my friends Free Agent Bike. I think thats mainly because mine is a stronger bike (he just rides his around time sometimes, he is a good skateboarder) but i was just wondering if ther was something i could do for around $70 or lower (I spent most of my extra cash on the bike) to make it a little lighter or preform better. Thanks for any advice. ; Hey whats up dude im glad to see you stuck with the Haro and  got it, If it has the heavy gauge steel pegs you can lighten up a little bit by takin those off and trying to find lighter ones, You can also try to find an aluminum seatpost to replace the one that came on it but make sure the one on it isnt aluminum already. Haro makes their bikes heavier nowadays but they are well made and once you get to know the bike it will be much easier to manuever. You can look for lighter handlebars as well but if you do, before you buy them make sure to take yours off first and weight them ,or take them with you when you goto get the new ones and with one in each hand determine which pair is heavier.\nI also have Free agent and it is a bit lighter than a couple of my haros but Ive been a haro buyer since 1985 and I'd never ever change the name of my favorite brand...Haro",6857

5,"have you seen the finalists for bbc sports personality of the year 2006....not a single footballer on there ? ; apparently the finalists are as folllows: jenson button (f1), joe calzaghe (boxing), darren clarke (golf), nicole cooke (cycling), ricky hatton (boxing), andy murray (tennis), monty panesar (cricket), zara phillips (equestrian), phil taylor (darts) and beth tweddle (gymnastics).\n\nwhat do you make of this selection? should a footballer be nominated for an award? if so, who would you give it to and why, in relation to their performances on the pitch? if not, why not? are footballers overrated in comparison to athletes of other sports? are you pleased that not a single football player is on the shortlist?\nwho or what is to blame for the demise in standards during and within the game, with events occuring on and off the pitch? and even as important, as football is shunned from the limelight in this instance of the sports personality of the year awards ceremony, do you consider it as more or less significant in your eyes?\n\ni still enjoy the game, but i believe it has lost its way recently ; I think this is a great selection if correct, especially as our local newspaper in Stoke-on-Trent has been lobbying for Phil Taylor's nomination!\n\nI can't think of a British footballer who would merit a nomination this year given England's appalling performance in the World Cup and British club's lack of success in Europe last season.\n\nYes I think footballers are over-rated in comparison to other sports, but they usually dominate these kind of awards because of the huge media exposure given to football.\n\nThe cause of the demise in the game can be traced directly to the amount of money now awash in the game, which has led to a ""win at all costs"" attitude, and also players who, to put it bluntly, have more money than sense.\n\nThe awards are not devalued for me in any way by no footballer making the final shortlist: it's great that Ricky Hatton and Joe Calzaghe have been recognised, along with Phil Taylor who is undisputably the best ever at his profession.  Credit also to Beth Tweddle as she has something no-one can ever take away from her - Britain's first ever world champion in her sport.  Top marks also to Nicole Cooke for overcoming horrendous injuries when she was knocked off her bike whilst training and going on to win the year-long World Cup.

So can we say that all the name of GODS mentioned in the different religious books (ALLAH, LORD, JEHOVA etc.) designate the same power?? If it is true so why there is so much hate between religions?? ; A very good question.\nThere are several questions within your one. \nI believe: ( through research and not belonging to any one religion)\n\nReligions define God by a name which is inherent in the human mind to tag something to understand it( tree, dog, human).  With the understanding of infinite thought and probabilities the One religions refer to is the same God.  The Source.  The source of light, dark and all existence.

Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God.

Learn to change your lifestyle and you'll be happier in the end and will end up not gaining the weight back from Drastic dieting or pills.  Once you start eating better and doing something for exercise the weight will come off --those that have more to lose will see a results faster than those that have only 5-10 lbs to lose.  For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.

Something powerful enough to plant the tiniest seed to grow all of life from. Am I missing some information? ; I think your on the right track my friend, but just expand your thinking a little bit on this subject. One of the most interesting theories I've heard about this subject comes from a book ""Stalking the Wild Pendulum""- (written by a self taught Astrophysicist!)It asserts that where there is matter there is consciousness and where there is consciousness there is an aspect of ""God""  Rather then God having a self encapsulated ego, god can be thought of all that is and all that is not.  This is often referred to as the ""god head"" or the ""Prime Mover.""  There may be some unification between the belief in God and in Evolution.  ""God"" emerged from the void realized ""Himself"" through ""His"" creation and then returned to the void.\nIn terms of your question regarding Homo Sapiens- our predecessors didn't evolve from the apes- although prehistoric man was ""ape-like""  Homo Erectus started to use tools to break open bones for the fat rich marrow inside to feed a very large and developing brain.  Apparently big brains require lots of energy!  The brain of our strain of primates distinguished themselves by all that Grey matter up there, unlike our ""ape"" cousins.",6902

Thanks! ; It depends on whats causing the pain. I've learned from experience that some of these machines cause you to stand in unnatural positions. Causing your alignment to be off balance. You are probably using your ankle in a position that is not right for you. Think about it... when your walking or running you dont stand that wide. Could be the shoes. Make sure u have good support. If you are small framed or shorter typed this positioning could definitely be the case.Sounds like your position on the machine is off so keep repositioning yourself on it and see if it continues.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026

1,"Is bipedal walking the most difficult thing to do for a human ? ; If bipedal walking was easy why are robots not able to walk in a bipedal manner. Since bipedal walking can be done only by humans  on this planet, it is the most difficult thing to learn and can be learnt only through evolution. Am I thinking right ? ; It's not the most difficult.  Look at how fast babies learn to walk compared to how fast they learn to talk.\n\nI read once that humans are the only bipedal mammal with no tail.  Kangaroos are bipedal (with tail) of course they don't walk.\n\nI would say it depends on the brain we are talking about: it's the simplest thing in the world for a large herbivore to walk, they do it within minutes of being born, predators can't walk for weeks.\n\nFor humans, maybe speech or higher cognitive skills are harder than walking.\n\nAs for robots, I don't know why they need to be bipedal, it is a very awkward and unsteady form of locomotion. I would say they will eventually be able to do it quite well, but we could be working on other things like AI instead.",7028

5,"Could a good Judo Black Belt hold there own grappling with a Black Belt in Jujitsu? ; I've been training in Judo and Jujitsu and found that some Judo players are really skilled on the ground.  It seems very common now for Judo players to cross train in Jujistu and to spend at least a 1/3 of the class on the matwork.  I don't know if it is the same in all regions and clubs.  I know some clubs even in my own area spend more time on matwork than other clubs.  With the popularity on MMA and jujitsu I just think the trend has been to go to more matwork and maybe the Judo players are catching up?  Or maybe the Jujistsu fighters will almost always beat the Judo guys on the ground? ; Judo is a fantastic art, in my experience a skilled judo player will have the advantage on a juijitsu trained person.\n \n However If the Judo player has no experience in practical application of Judo techniques in real life situations, or again does not know the tools of juijitsu and how to be wary of them then some of the quick applications of juijitsu groundwork may be effective. As could any technique.\n\n The only judo trained player I have seen in action was from a third world country where he had ample experience in using judo to protect his health, i do not think any juijitsu player would have stood a chance against him.\n\n In my eyes its impossible to say this stystem over this one, it is often more a case of the player. Juijitsu certainly has some technical advantages on the ground as does judo when standing\n\n however this means very little, its all very hypothetical\n if opposing players trained in each squared up, they would surely be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that each style potentially has, and do thier best to try and avoid these\n\nmat work is not very good if the judo master has just thrown you fifteen feet into a tree",7094

If, however, that doesn't mean much to you, then you're in my boat and wondering by what measure should we determine what is the best school?\n\nThe best way to judge for yourself is to visit the campus and talk to people there - formally (the public face) and informally (the face you'll get without admissions office control).  For example, talk to some students at random in the union.\n\nBeing from Ohio, I know a bit more about Ohio Wesleyan.  My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.  Basically, OW wasn't even in my list of places to consider.  Perhaps some things have changed in the last 15 years or perhaps not, but no new news has prompted me to change my opinion.  I made a point of visiting quite a few universities when I was searching in 1990.  I probably visited OWU, but I don't recall.  It had that much of an impression on me.  In the meantime, Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, Kenyon, Baldwin Wallace, Maimi U, OSU, and some schools in SE Michigan DID make an impression on me and I still wonder if some of them would have been a better choice.  As it was though, I made the decision based on finding a program that was relatively unique and that I found very attractive so that it wasn't the university, but the degree program that won me over.",7102
2,"My friend is facing problem of moles(til) on the face. Plz sugg. some home remedies or any ointment.? ; She is also having some black spots on the face from 10-15 days and becoming dark. ; Hi Renuka\n\nHere are some answers.\n\nCause \nWarts and moles are usually the result of a nutritional deficiency and they should be treated internally, as well as externally. \nPotassium deficiency. \n\n1.General Information for Warts and Moles: The warts, moles and skin blemishes are helped externally and are often cleared up by using the white milk from dandelions and/or from milkweed. Applying castor oil or garlic oil to the area several times a day and taping a piece of gauze soaked with this oil over the wart during the night will aid in clearing the condition. The use of a clove of garlic cut in half (or mashed or grated) and kept over the wart all night until it is gone has aided many. Black walnut tincture and the following combination tincture have been used with such success that a number of people swear by them. The combination tinctures consists of blue vervain, black cohosh, blue cohosh, skullcap and lobelia herbs in equal parts, using 90 proof or stronger alcohol as a base. \n\n2.More General Information for Warts and Moles: Use the mucusless diet and add plenty of raw carrots, kelp, dulse, or sea weed and onions to the diet. \n\n\n3.Garlic for Warts and Moles: Here is a very successful routine for removal of these unwanted growths called moles, or warts. Take a button of garlic, slice or cut in two, and placed the cup area over a wart of mole. Tape it on, and as it dries out put a fresh piece. Many users have reported good results. \n\n4.Potassium Deficiency for Warts and Moles: When cysts or tumors grow in places where they can be seen outside the body, often we react by having them cut out. This defeats healing by working on the effect instead of the cause. You can cut cysts out, tumors off, and burn warts off (which are also a potassium deficiency), or get rid of as many moles as you wish, but unless you go to the cause, they will grow back again, and you may end up with as many or more cysts, tumors, moles as before. Different signs of potassium deficiency will keep popping out on the body because the condition that needs correcting is on the inside. You have to go into the cause, Dr. Christopher always insisted, which is the way we have been eating.Potassium sources: There are several ways to receive your potassium. Dr. Bernard Jensen sells a potassium broth made from dehydrated vegetables. Dr. Bronner makes a similar, excellent product. You can also make your own potassium broth by simmering equal parts of red potatoes, celery, carrots, onions, and herbs to taste. Raw vegetable and fruit juices also flood the system with potassium. \n\nBest of health to you",7105
2,"How can you obtain a flat tummy after having children? ; Any expert exercise advice on this subject would be appreciated? ; im not exactly sure if this will give you a flat stomach after having kids, but i do know its easy and it gave me six pack abs. you lie flat on the ground( make sure you have plenty of padding, like good thick carpet) put your hands behind your head like your gonna do krunchs but instead lift your off the ground keeping your legs strait and bring your upper body up until you make a 90 degree angle, make sure you rotate your upper body as you go up until your left elbow is pointing towards your right knee, then go back down but dont let your feet or shoulders touch the ground, then go back up and rotate to the other side. I know it sounds hard but unless your really really out of shape you can do these espeacilly if you start easy like 6 or eight reps then repeat 2-4 times with 30 seconds rest in between. Every other day should be fine. When this gets easy move it up 4, try to get up to 20 then you'll be looking really good. Make sure while your doing this to suck in your gut(even if you dont have one suck in your stomach) so you can shape your abs to look their best, otherwise your stomach will just look akward.

1,"Do you think that life could exist on Mars? Why or why not? ; I think that the prospects of life on Mars could exist, after all water did supposedly exist once on Mars and if there was life, it would probably have been some type of a microorganism existed on life and possibly even before life existed on Earth. If science does discover that life did exist on Mars, it will be the greatest science event to occur in the history of the world. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars ; Statistically, it is very hard to believe that we (Earthliens) are along in the universe, there must be something else out there.\nAt the same time, the odds that life would develop independently on both Earth and Mars in the same solar system is pretty slim (unless life is actually not nearly as rare as we might think).\n\nThere is of course a chance that life may have developed on Mars in the past when the conditions were more suitable, but so far, we havent found anything.  Although there is the possibility, I am leaning towards no.\n\nBut think what that would mean if we discovered life outside of Earth (especially on Mars), it would be the most important discovery...ever.  If life can develop independently on two planets in the same solar system, either we are very lucky, or it the whole universe must be crawling with life (or you could throw the God factor in if you wish).",7110

9,"For those that say they are against the death penalty but for abortion....? ; How can you support the taking of an innocent life and be opposed to taking the life of someone that has committed acts of evil? Those on death row have hurt innocent people, families, children and society. What acts has an unborn child committed to deserve the fate of being aborted. \n\nThis is a perfect example of how liberals are on the wrong side of issues. Liberals will claim that abortion is a right to privacy issue - the so called, ""it is my body and I can do with it what I wish"". Well- a person cannot do whatever they wish with their body if it effects me. You cannot take your fist (which is part of your body) and punch me in the face. A person has the right to privacy in their home, but that does not extend to activities which are illegal. Your rights end where my rights begin. A heart beats at less than 4 weeks. Isn't a heart beat the final determinat ; I know you don't actually want an answer - you seem more interested in pontificating.  Be that as it may, it is perfectly easy to justify a belief in the legality of abortion vs. the legality of the death penalty.  For me, capital punishment is a governmental rights issue - that is, I do not believe the government has the right to deprive its citizens of life under any circumstances.  It's simply something the government should not be allowed to do, because allowing it for some people (odious though they may be) makes it easier to apply it for lesser crimes - a slippery slope argument, essentially.\n\nAbortion is a different issue, because (1) it is not the government depriving someone of life; (2) there's no scientific reason to argue that life begins at conception; and (3) if we assume life begins at conception, then all laws regarding children would apply to zygotes/fetuses, which would be unworkable in any society.",7165

These chordates have the primitive support structure, a dorsal notochord. \nAdult Tunicates lack notochords, except for the planktoninc and tiny Appendiculaceans.  Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse. Almost all are included in genus Branchiostoma, so if you look for ""Branchiostoma"" or ""lancelet"" you'll get what you're searching.",7179

But don't just get the basic lettuce and tomato/carrot kind, to make them really healthy and make sure you get your protein and other nutrients like beta-carotenes and amino acids...add beans like garbanzo, adzuki, pinto, lima etc....whatever you like.  Add beets, carrots, tomatoes, jicama, potatoes, corn, peas, tofu, nuts of all kinds like cashews, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts.  Then make sure you get a good salad dressing that is not full of hydrogenated fats and MSG.  IN fact, avoid all that stuff if you can.  If you want to be healthy, then read ingredient lables and avoid things like hydrogenate/trans fats, MSG, food colorings, preservatives and sugar if possible.  Those will certainly decrease your health overtime.  \nHere's something else very viable for someone who only has once a week cooking time and is low income.  I feel for you girl!  I was the same while living in LA and it just about killed my spirit.  Hang in there!\n\nGoto a $dollar store or somewhere they have very cheap tupperware or those kind of disposable containers that you can use over and over until they're dead.  But a bunch.  Like 6 or 8+.  THen goto Costco or another large chain store where you can buy bulk for less $.  \nBuy salad makings, canned beans/corn/peas etc...salad dressing and look for ground turkey too. \n\nYou can then make up salads for a few days and put them in the tupperware.  Make sure you drain all  the beans and stuff of water so that they don't wilt the salad lettuce.  Don't add dressing either, it will wilt it.  Add that later.  Buy a tupperware thingy for dressing too..a small one. \n\nThen make a large turkey meatloaf or chicken soup and split it into containers for the weeks.  I know it's boring but do a different meal each week.  It's what you sometimes have to do when  you're poor.  It sucks but it's better than eating crap at a fast food place.  You know!  \n\nTry making large meals and spliting into many containers, freezing them  until ready for use.  Meatloaf, stuffed cabbage with meat and rice in tomato sauce, tuna casseroles and soup and stuff like that freezes well. Let all the food cool first.  You can also make cheap stir frys with veggies and rice and soy sauce which is cheap and goes a long way.  Just watch your salt intake.  Make sure you drink a lot of plain purified water if you can.  \n\nRecipe for meatloaf:\n\nleast one pound or more of ground turkey/beef(turkey's better and better for you). \ncan of tomato paste\ncan of tomato sauce(not flavored yet)\none large carrot cut in small bits\none large zuccini cut in small bits\none large egg\ndash of spices if you have it, at least salt though\n\nmix together well and then bake for like 30 minutes at around 350-400˚.  sooooo friggin good.  \n\nchicken soup:\n\nwhole already cooked chicken like at safeway or something like that.  cheap and good.  \nagain, two carrots cut into small bits\nzuccini into small bits\ncelery into small bits\npotatoes into small bits \netc...of whatever you like\n\nchop up chicken pieces and save a couple of bones to put in pot while cooking.  it adds flavor and minerals from the bone. \ncut up veggies add them to 5+ cups of water.  eyeball it and see if you need more.  don't add salt.  the meat is salty enough.  do that later to taste. \nsimmer that for a couple of hours.  1-2.  \nadd cilantro if you can afford to.\n\nStuffed cabbage and meat:\n\nagain take the meat either turkey or beef you bought \nboil rice-2 cups\nget a cabbage and boil it for around 1 hour until the outter leaves are soft.  be careful, extremely hot!!\ntomato sauce and spices/salt\n\nmix rice and meat and sauce into large bowl with spices\nagain, hot be careful! \n\npeel off outter leaves while being careful not to break or split.  keep them intact. \ntake some of the meat mixture and stuff into leaves and roll them up around mixture. make a bunch ",7283

Obviously you want to use the least amount of steel so as to maximise your profits. Can you work out the dimensions of the containers? How many different boxes of the same type will you have? And if possible, illustrate your response with graphs and tables, well-documented. ; Since one litre = 1000cm^3,   We can construct a cylindrical container with surface area S = 2pir^2 +2pirh.(I am using pi since I don' t have the greek symbol.)

Legislation is suppossed to be done entirely by the Congress. ; This problem started back during the first term of the F.D.R. Administration. F.D.R. was attempting to push through his ""New Deal"" legislation and the Supreme Court was striking down pieces of legislation left and right because they were not within the enumerated powers of the federal goverment.\n\nF.D.R.'s solution to this little problem was to threaten to pack the court with justices who would vote the way he wanted. Back then there was no constitutionally stipulated maximum to the number of justices that could be put on the court so long as the president nominated them and the Senate gave their consent.\n\nWith this very real threat in place, the High Court backed down, and ever since we have essentially had no limit on the powers of the federal government.\n\nThis is the single greatest threat to our country.

1,"About my last question regarding Maxwell Wheel.? ; In the Maxwell Wheel the angular velocity is w = v/r where r is the pole's radius and v is the translational velocity of the pole. But the v is also the tangential velocity of each point at the surface of the pole. So I understand that these velocities are equal (Why is that?) Furthermore, the angular velocity of the wheel is equal to the angular velocity of the pole, right? But in that case w=V/R, when V supposed to be the translational velocity of the wheel, don't it? But the translational velocities of the wheel and the pole are equal (they're falling together), so V=v,\nbut R!=r (not equal) so this is a paradox. Where am I wrong? ; ok.  call the downward translational velocity of the whole thing v.  this means that the tangential velocity at the edge of the poles (at the radius r) is equal to v.  the reason for this is that the strings are wound AROUND THE POLES, so this winding and the condition that the string has to unwrap for the thing to move, sets the angular velocity w = v/r.\n\nnow, if you look at the main wheel part, the angular velocity has to be equal to the angular velocity of the poles, since they are one solid piece.  however, as you note the radius of the wheel R > r.  so, the fact that v / r = w = V / R implies that V > v.  in other words, the motion of the outer edges of the wheel is faster than the motion of the outer edges of the rods.\n\ni think you are getting confused by saying that V is the translational velocity of the wheel.  it's not.  v is the translational velocity of the wheel, and of the rods.  the fact that the string is wound *around the rods* and not around the wheel sets the angular velocity of the whole apparatus equal to v/r.  V, the tangential velocity of the outer edges of the wheel, is much faster than the translational velocity.\n\nthat clear?",7320

2,"Fill me in about asthma..? ; What are symptoms of asthma..mild and severe? and if u can get it and lose it at anytime in ure life, then why arent there ways to prevent it? what causes asthma? how can start from a healthy point in someones life? ; Well, let me tell you what I know about asthma.\n\nWhat causes it?  Allergies can trigger it...Many triggers include, dust, dander from animals, pollen, leaf mold, dust mites and I read that roach pooh can trigger it. (UGH)\n\nMy youngest daughter had asthma and outgrew by age 5.\n\nMy oldest daughter began experiencing symptoms when she was eleven. (shortness of breath and wheezing, especially upon exertion) She is 31 years old now and has lots of problems with it. She has been hospitalized several times in the last few years with it. She uses a puffer. Her Dr prescribed her meds for a nebulizer. For her birthday --I bought her a nebulizer.\n\nSeveral of my grandchildren had problems with wheezing when they were infants.\n\nI didn't experience problems with shortness of breath and wheezing until I quit smoking about 6 years ago. I smoked for over thirty years. I have COPD but I also have asthma. \nWith the asthma I experience shortness of breath. Even getting ready to go to work can leave me breathless, at times. When I have overexerted myself, I wheeze. I experience thses symptoms every day.\n\nPeople who bath in perfume or aftershave really tear my lungs up. I get wheezy after a few minutes of inhaling the mess.\n\nWhen the wind blows, dust and allergens send my lungs into a tail spin. Sometimes extremes in temperature affect me too.\n\nI am on  Zyrtec (for allergies), Spiriva (a steroid dry powder inhaler), Advair (another dry powder steroid inhaler), Prednisone (a steroid) and I also have a nebulizer to use when I am having a really rough time.\n\nSometimes emotions and stress can affect Asthma.\n\nThey use to say that asthma wasn't that serious but now they know different. A person can die with a serious attack. \n\nIf you suspect that you, or any person in your family has asthma, Go to a Dr. Only your GP or a pulmonologist can gauge the seriousness of your condition and prescribe medications to alleviate your symptoms and make life a bit easier for you.\n\nTake Care,\n~Linda~",7325

Is there a way I can configer my computer to make it look like I live in the US? Thank you ; Yes, you can use a proxy server.  A proxy server acts like a middle man.

1,"One question regarding evolution: What blew up in the Big Bang and where did it come from? Eternal matter? ; So do you BELIEVE IN eternal matter, or an ETERNAL GOD?  The key word in both cases is BELIEVE.  Yes, like it or not, Evolution IS a system of belief. ; The Big Bang \n\nAbout fifty years ago, American astronomers studying the galactic star clusters, stumbled on evidence that the entire Universe is blowing up before our eyes. According to their observations, all the galaxies in the Universe are moving away from us and from one another at very high speeds, and the most distant are receding at the extraordinary speed of hundreds of millions of miles an hour.\n\nFirst there was nothing and it blew up and then there was everything and scientists have calculated that it all happened in 1043 of a second. [The] echo of that explosion can still be heard bouncing around in space. Scientists claim that in the big bang all of the fundamental particles necessary for life were formed. All of the complexity we see around us is the result of this massive explosion.\n\n""The new finding hit the scientific world like a thunderclap."" It meant that the idea of an ultimate beginning was no longer merely religious dogma. Science itself now indicated that the universe burst into existence at a particular time in the remote past.\n\nIn 1992 measurements by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) and by the Hubble Space Telescope seemed to confirm beyond any reasonable doubt that the Big Bang cosmology is indeed correct. George Smoot, Professor at the University of California at Berkeley and Principle Investigator of the COBE team which made the discovery, said regarding these new observations, ""What we have found is evidence for the birth of the universe . . . It's like looking at God.""\n\nWorking backwards, the evidence implies that there was a time when the universe was infinitesimally small. The evidence from general relativity also indicates that it was not merely a case of the matter in the universe being concentrated at a particular location, but that space itself was this tiny. At a sudden instant in time all of the energy and mass in the universe was located at this infinitesimally small point and exploded. The currently observed outbound motion of the galaxies from each other is a continuing effect of that explosion.\n\n""The scientific community is prepared to consider the idea that God created the universe is a more respectable hypothesis today than at any time in the last 100 years,"" Frederic B. Burnham, science historian, declared.\n\nHowever, some die-hard secularists propose that the universe goes through endless cycles of expansions and collapses. Hence, eternity becomes nothing more than an eternal succession of big bangs followed by big crunches followed by big bangs followed by big crunches over and over again and again forever.\n\nBut this violates the second law of thermodynamics, the law of decay, that implies that the universe is in a process of gradual disintegration - running down, like a wound-up clock. And if it is running down, then there must have been a time when it was wound up. Once the big bang takes place and the universe begins its expansion, entropy starts to increase. From this point on it will never be able to go back to its original state.\n\nWhat's more, the first law of thermodynamics (the conservation of matter) implies that matter cannot just pop into existence or create itself. And therefore, if the universe had a beginning, then something external to the universe must have caused it to come into existence - something, or Someone, transcendent to the natural world.\n\nThe facts clearly indicate that the universe is not eternal, and it cannot originate itself The implication is that the universe began at a definite moment in time, in a flash of light and energy. Science has begun to sound eerily like Genesis 1: ""And God said, 'Let there be light""' (1:3).\n\nThe evidence requires that we believe God formed the universe at His command, pointing to the importance of taking God at His word literally - from the beginning both of time and the Bible. Second, there is such a striking parallel between the Hebrews 1",7383

8,"Guys-- why is the idea of having sex with two girls pleasurable? ; My BF told me before he could have sex with two girls- one of them being me of course.

I don't understand... ; Ok, I have to say that a lot of the answers that you have received so far are close, but none of them quite hit the mark or cover all the bases, so I am going to see what I can do here. \n First of all, I am fairly qualified here as my fiancé and I have done a threesome with both another woman and another guy, and our relationship has survived it unscathed. \n To answer the main question of why. . . There is no single answer that would apply to all men that have those desires. Yes, porn for a lot of us has glorified the threesome. Another common reason is that watching two women be intimate is quite erotic. Lets face it, they call you the ""fairer sex"" for a reason!!\n Could your BF feel pressure to please you? If so, a second person could be viewed as a helper.\n The most common reason, however, is simply the desire to have variety in ones sex life.\n Now, let's address how you should go forward. First of all, your BF shared a fantasy with you, and if you ever want him to ever do so again, you cannot react negatively to it. That does not mean that you have to do it, but you also want to avoid him feeling rejection from it.\n To help you decide if having a threesome with another woman is something you want to do, consider this:\n Are you physically attracted to women? I.E. Are you bi/bi-curious? If so, you could decide that you are will have a threesome with him with the stipulation that he and the other woman do not have sex. Set very specific boundaries, I.E. Is touching ok? Is kissing ok? Is manual stimulation ok? Etc. . . If you cannot trust him to abide by these boundaries during the heat of the moment, you do NOT want to do this!\n If you decide that you do not want to do this, explain it to him, but offer to incorporate it into your fantasy life. Say something to him like ""The idea turns me on, but I would not be ok with the reality of it"", and then bring it up in a sexy way during foreplay or lovemaking. Reiterate after you are done having sex that this is something that can only be a fantasy, never a reality. This is often the perfect compromise in these situations.\n In my experience, a man bringing this fantasy to his significant other is generally sign of developing trust, and not of impending doom. The act itself, however, has been the end of many strong relationships, so tread carefully!!",7395

3,"need help from an elementary school teacher? ; i want to teach only in elementary school, what degree do i need, how long will it take to get it, and what's the best grade to teach, i'm also thinking about teaching art, can someone please help me. ; If you are in the United States, you need to do the following:\n\n1. Earn a Bachelor's Degree in Education, with your specialization as Elementary. If you are interested in becoming an art teacher, your specialization would be Art, or you could extend your program and have two specializations. This includes coursework, field observations, practicums, and student teaching.\n\n2. Pass state professional competency exams in basic skills, general knowledge, professional knowledge, and your area(s) of speciality.\n\n3. Pass local, state, and federal background checks.\n\n4. Obtain a state license (your teacher prep program will help you get everything done for that).\n\nI would also recommend that while you get your degree, you work as a substitute teacher as soon as you  have enough college credits to qualify for hire. You can sub different grade levels and get a real feel for what level you like best, and it builds your resume.\n\nVolunteer teach kids' art classes at your local library, museums, and/or community college to gain additional experience and build your resume.",7397
8,"When do you know when an boy really likes you? ; This boy I now goes out with is fun and when I am always mad he makes me happy. It is just 1 Thing that is getting me mad is that I think he likes an another girl.But also He calls Me everyday an he said that I am the one for him because his sister got us together. So what sould I do? ; You need to remember one thing.  (I've been through this) If he really likes you, you don't have to worry.  He will be WITH you.  He may have other female friends, but if he really likes you, he will do things for yout that he won't for others.  If you feel special when you are together, and hee feels the same way, you have nothing to worry about.  \n  One thing that WILL kill a relationship is jealousy.  Jealousy can consume a person and transform a healthy relationship into one of confrontation and eventual failure.  How can you prevent feeling jealous?  You can't.  It's a natural feeling.  You can, however, control it.  The easiest way to control jealousy is to have an honest and open communications with your boyfriend.  ALWAYS, ALWAYS, you must be honest with each other.  Communication is the key to this.  Not very many young boys are able to communicate as openly as girls want. (BTW, I am a man and have realized this from my past)  So it may take some work to get him to open up, however once you get this communication flowing in an honest manner, it will come naturally and your relationship will become more and more solid.  At the same time, remember that not all relationship are meant to be.  Sometimes, the relationship will fail because one party has a changes in interests that does not agree with the other. This is where communication comes in.  \n  I hope I have been able to offer some insight and hopefully answer your question as I see it from my perspective.  Good luck and take care.",7398

You know, she does all the socially right things (like immediate thank you notes, volunteering to cook on family holidays, sending flowers when people have had a rough week- that type of stuff). But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could.

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

1,"what is pyloric antrum? ; in anatomy ; yloric antrum is initial portion of the pyloric part of the stomach. It is near the bottom of the stomach on the lateral side of the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach and the small intestine. It may temporarily become partially or completely shut off from the remainder of the stomach during digestion by peristaltic contraction of the prepyloric sphincter; it is demarcated, sometimes, from the second part of the pyloric part of the stomach (pyloric canal) by a slight groove. The pyloric antrum is the location of several important endocrine cells including Gastrin-producing G Cells (stimulate acid production) and the luminal-pH-sensitive population of somatostatin producing of D cells (responsible for shutting off acid secretion. There is a second hormone-sensitive population near the fundus.)\n\nSynonym: antrum pyloricum, antrum, lesser cul-de-sac.\n\nSources:\n\n    * William F Ganong.

However, if the anvil were not on the stomach, the person would certainly have been injured by the blow. Explain (in terms of inertia)... \n\nI simply dnt get anything from that q..\n\n- Suppose you have a hammer w/ a loose head. Although u could strike the hammerhead w/ a solid object to secure it on the handle, an easier method to secure it is to grasp the handle of the hammer repeatedly strike the butt (end opposite the handle) on a solid surface. Explain in terms of F.u.c.k.i.n inertia.. sry getting rlly frustrated 4rm this confusing stuff... ; A body in motion tends to stay in motion, a body at rest tends to stay at rest. The anvil is at rest and it wants to stay that way. It absorbs the energy imparted on it from the hammer. It has too much mass compared to the mass of the hammer. Try to think what would happen if you kicked a 1 ton boulder. It doesn't move because your foot doesn't have enuf mass. If you dropped the 1 ton boulder on the anvil, the reclining person won't have a chance. There is too much mass for the anvil to absorb.\nThe loose head is in motion, so is the hammer and the butt end of the hammer. When the butt end of the hammer hits the solid surface, it stops moving. The surface has too much mass for the hammer to overtake. The loose head is moving, and when the hammer stops, the loose head wants to stay in motion. So it slides down the hammer handle and since the hammer handle is wedge-shaped where the head is, the head wedges itself against it until the force of the moving head is absorbed by the handle.",7435

Ifr you see me around smiling you ""NO"" I escaped ha ha.\n\nI know a little boy who just loves those guys who do try to explain the trinity.

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

Aside from that you should tell them that you do drink occasionally.  Drinking does have a negative effect on anti-depressants as in it totaly negates the effect the anti-depressant will have on your brain.

2,"what can a person take to control cough? ; Without taking a perscription drug. ; HI BARB\n\nHere is the cause and a remedy for you.\n\nCause \nThis is often caused by a stomach disorder that comes from overloading the system with food, wherein fermentation in the stomach causes phlegm. It may also be induced by inflammation in the bronchial tubes due to a neglected cold. Worms may be the cause. Many coughs are from a nervous condition, where coughing may eventually become habitual. Coughs are highly misunderstood. Usually a sore throat and coughing are caused by the sinuses draining the eustachian tubes, which is like pouring acid down the throat. A cough usually comes from a lowered vitality in the system from improper diet, loss of sleep, lack of exercise, and fresh air, improper breathing, poor elimination, or improper night clothing and bedding. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1. Acute coughs can often be relieved with a little honey and onion syrup. When it is the result of an old acute condition, clear out the morbid condition as rapidly as possible without causing irritation. In old cough conditions, comfrey with vervain or mullein are very good. The antispasmodic tincture is also excellent, and it is good to massage the chest area across the back with an antispasmodic tincture during attacks of spasms. Antispasmodic tincture may be used both internally and externally as a liniment on the throat. If this is due to a neglected cold, any of the diaphoretic herbs are excellent. To relieve the coughing spasms, use horehounds, comfrey, or a small amount of lobelia. High enemas of herbal laxatives will relieve congestion of the bowels, and if the cough is severe (asthma, whooping cough) load the stomach with liquids and induce vomiting. \n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers",7531

1,"At what temperature is Chlorophyll destroyed. I can't  find a boiling point for it ... if it even has one. ; How hot do you have to heat a green leaf before it turns brown indicating  the chlorophyll is destroyed? ; Chlorophyll is a rather complex and most of all large molecule, which means that the pure substance will be a solid.   In a leaf the chlorophyll is in solution.\n\nLeaves turning brown most likely involves encymatic digestion of parts of the molecule. The core construction of chlorophyll is quite hardy - a flat system of five- or six-atom rings with a central magnesium ion held in place by nitrogen atoms pointing to it in a square. (Hemoglobine and one of the vitamins have a similar basic structure, hemoglobine with iron in the centre and the vitamin with cobalt.)\n\nYou can dry a leaf and keep the chlorophyll intact at temperatures up to 120°C without any browning effect. Such a dried leaf will remain green, unlike a wet leaf where encymatic digestion will destroy the pigment.\n\nThe leaf will turn brown at temperatures where paper also begins to turn brown - when the cellulosis of the plant cells begins to split off water. This may start around 451°F...",7538

4,"what is DD-RAM? ; answer my question plz... ; I dont know if You mean DVD-RAM\n\nA dvd is a digital video/versatile disk and RAM is Random Access Memory.\nThe DVD-RAM format is based on PD-RW (Phase-Differential) drives, and actually uses a cartridge to hold the media (just like its PD-RW predecessor). Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are). The Plextor PX-504U is an example of an external DVD+R/+RW drive capable of recording single layer discs in the +R/+RW format, but also able to read discs recorded by a DVD-R drive.",7559
4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

Find the hegiht of the smaller building and the horizontal distance between the two buildings. ; Trigonometry is hard to do in you head, so start out by making a drawing. You have two buildings A (tall) and B (short) - Draw them far apart, not like this:\n\nA         B\n|         \n|         \n|    \n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n\nNow draw one line from the top of A to the top of B - this is the angle of depression of the top and it is 46 degrees. That is, if you drew a straight, horizontal line across the top of building A, the angle between that line and the line joining the top of A to the top of B is 46 degress.\n\nSimilarly, draw a line from the top of A to the *bottom* of B - this is the angle of depression of the bottom and it is 77 degrees. That is, the angle between the horizontal line across the top of A, and the line between top of A and bottom of B is 77 degrees.\n\nNow can you find out the angle between the line from A-top to B-top, and the line from A-top to B-bottom? (It's very important for you to draw this!) Let's put this value aside for a minute. \n\nLooking at your drawing, can you see that you know the value for *part* of the angle between the horizontal line across A's top and length of building A? What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom.

6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business.

8,"Wedding+Distance=Crazy difficult. Ideas? ; My fiance and I are facing an issue with planning a wedding.\nWe live in the lower peninsula of Michigan (Cadillac, if you want to mapquest it or something). My friends and immediate family are local to us currently, as well as 2 hours to the south. His family and closest friends, however, are located in the upper peninsula, close to Wisconsin--about an 8 hour drive. The problem this presents is: Where should we have our wedding? If we did it in one place or the other, it would obviously be difficult for the side furthest away. The idea of doing it somewhere in the middle is possible, but I've been involved in planning two weddings, and I would not look forward to the added difficulty of planning one 3 or 4 hours from the venue.\n   Luckily, our engagement shall be long, so we're not tied to any sort of real deadline right now. Even so, we'd like to work out some solutions before it the date is dangerously close. Anyone who has been through a similar situation, or simply has some ideas? ; Not sure how much money you have budgeted for your wedding, but how about getting married at Castle Farms up in Charlevoix, MI.  I personally have never been there, but the pictures on the website are just beautiful.  You can have both the ceremony and the reception in the same place.  It's about 2 hours north of Cadillac.  You can even go on a virtual tour on the site.  Check it out: http://www.castlefarms.com/index.cfm\n\nIf you don't want to go with a full service place like this somewhere in the middle, I would just recommend having it locally.  It will make your life a whole lot easier.  Most everyone had to drive about 2 hours to get to my wedding.  I probably should have had it over in Muskegon/Grand Haven, where most of my family lives, but I just loved the place I found in Battle Creek.  Plus I live in Battle Creek and it just made my life easier.  \n\nIf you have it far away you will have to transport all of your supplies to that location.  Could be difficult and what if you forget something.  If I forgot something I only need to drive or have someone drive about 10-15 minutes to get it.

In your heart you know that you want to be a Freemason.  Because the fraternity does not evangelize in any way we never ask anyone to become a Mason.  Every member has joined of his own freewill and has not been persuaded to become a member.  Your own Grandfather followed this rule and never asked you to join his lodge.\n\nSearch out the most respected members of your community and you will find that they are probably Freemasons.  Tell your desire to one of these men and he will secure for you a petition to the lodge.  A committee of inquiry will call on you at your home to make sure that your desires are true,  that you are a respected member of the community and worthy to become a Mason.   If the committee approves of you; the entire lodge will be notified and you must pass a unanimous ballot.  If any member of the lodge feels that you are unworthy; you will never become a member of the lodge as long as the objection exists.\n\nAs a member you will be part of the world's oldest and greatest fraternity.  You will find charitable needs and causes, education, fellowship, and friendship.  One of the greatest gifts a man can give to another is to help him become a Mason.  I hope that I am responding in such a way that I can give this gift to you.",7599

1,"How to solve the Three-Jugs Problem mathematically (Very Complicated!!)? ; Two friends who have an eight-quart jug of water wish to share it evenly. They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

Such as Choloroform(CHCl3), Na2SO4, KCl, and BaSo4\n\nI would greatly appreciate anyone's help with this! ; We've to get this clear first. Water is a polar solvent, gasoline is a non-polar solvent. By the principal of like-dissolves-like, polar molecules will dissolve in water, for example, NaCl; while non-polar molecules will dissolve in gasoline, for example, fats, phosholipids, alkanes, alkenes etc.\n\nFor the question you've asked,\nChloroform is a polar compund because Cl draws electrons from the carbon center and making Cl atoms have a higher concerntration of electrons. Hydrogen atoms in water carry a partially positive charge and hence are attracted to Cl molecule. Hence it is soluble in water.\n\nNa2SO4 is soluble in water. This is because it is actually 2 Na+ ions attached to SO4(2-) ions. Na+ ions get attracted to oxygen atoms in water which has a partially negative charge and SO4(2-) ions gets attracted to hydrogen atoms in water which has a partially positive charge.\n\nKCL is soluble in water because Cl atoms draws electrons from K. Follow the same reasoning as chloroform.\n\nFor BaSO4, it is insoluble in water. Only barium nitrate dissolves in water. Other barium salts do not.\n\nHope this helps! =)",7637

That is (t is time)\nF = delta p/delta t \nF = delta (m*v) / dt\nwe usually say m is constant so\nF = m * v/dt\nF =  ma    (a is acceleration or a change in v/time)\n\nNewtons third law is also based on momentum.  ""For every action there is an equal, yet opposite, reaction.""\n\nSo...  When a gun is fired what we see is the bullet propelled forward and the gun (and gun holder) propelled back.  Both received the same Force but because the gun and person holding it are much more massive than the bullet, the bullet will travel much faster. \ne.g F1 is the force on the bullet which is the same as the force on the person F2\nF1 = F2\ndelta p1/dt = delta p2/dt\nm1v1/dt = m2v2/dt\nm1v1 =m2v2\nImagine the bullet is 1 gram and a 180 lbs (~8182 grams) person shot the bullet...

1,"Physics Collision and Impulse? ; Basilisk lizards can run across the top of a water surface.  With each step, a lizard first slaps its foot against the water and then pushes it down into the water rapidly enough to form an air cavity around the top of the foot.  To avoid having to pull the foot back up against the water drag in order to complete the step, the lizard withdraws the foot before water can flow into the air cavityIf the lizard is not to sink, the average upward impulse on the lizard during this full action of slap, downward push, and withdrawal must match the downward impulse due to the gravitational force.  Suppose the mass of the basilisk lizard is 90.0 g, the mass of each foot is 3.00 g, the speed of a foot as it slaps the water is 1.50 m/s, and the time for a single step is 0.600 s. \n\n(A) What is the magnitude of impulse on the lizard during slap?

In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part. Hmmm. Seems to be missing from the site you posted as well.\n\nFirst, if trying to construct an argument, you may want to pull facts from something other than a conservative spin house. By the way, the same goes for liberals. I'm tired of seeing people posting links to places of strong bias.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to this. The part your missing is when Clinton got the smack layed down on him.\n\nYou see, he had the authority in 1993 but he didn't use it  (or get caught rather) until a few years later. When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this. At least, amongst the people I knew then (many of them liberals).\n\nMy view on the whole thing is to get rid of it. It's to dangerous in the hands of the executive, especially when said executive has granted himself to power to declare whether or not someone is an enemy.\n\nI don't want to see ANYONE with that power.

CANT run or swim . i have acidity prob so cant diet. how sucsessful is disc replacement surgery. i ve 10 kg extra weight. how to get back in shape and over with slip disc ; Your body burns alot of calories just keeping all your systems  going.\nThe trick is to keep your body in a calorie burning mode not a calorie storage mode.\nWhen you mention acidity problems (in addition to the extra weight) I jump to the conclusion that you eat meals and snacks that do not contain protein. Your stomach assumes you'll include protein every time you eat. The acid your stomach produces is only for breaking down proteins. No protein means nothing for the acid to do so it is 'in excess'.\nEvery time you eat a meal or snack without protein it usually means it's high in starch or sugar. When you eat starchy or sugary meals/snacks you body produces insulin which switches you from a calorie burning mode to a calorie storage mode. Insulin tells your body to store fat. You will also end up producing extra insulin which causes your blood sugar to drop and giving you cravings.\n\nLosing the weight is probably the best thing you can do for your back (and feet, and knees, and heart, and eyes, and......) Don't let the sugar/starch addiction control you and keep you down.\n\nCut down on the sugar/starches in your meals and add more fat and protein. Don't skip meals (causes insulin spikes when you finally do eat) and try to eat Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. Your brain likes the sugar spikes and won't want you to change. Keep your blood sugar stable and you will be strong enough to do it. The weight will come off.\n\nSimple walking is a great way to burn more caloreis while in the calorie burning mode.",7790

2,"should i be concerned?? ; i have always had rough periods. after i had my daughter i didn't have one for 18 months. the doc determined the cause was due to ovarian cysts caused by my birth control. i quit takung them and after a few months i started having periods agaun. then, i started having them every-other month. then, on monday, i started my period but it was terrible. i had to change dressings every hour. i never had a period that heavy, especiaaly on the first day, not even after i had my daughter. anyway, it got to the point at work were i wore tampons and pads to keep from leaking. then, i got real sick. my stomach started cramping severally, i got hot,dizzy , nausus, and felt like i would pass out. when i woke up the next morning it was as though i never started. the only sign i had was a little bit of bloody discharge after going to the rr. it has been 2 days and nothing has happned. i know i am not pg because i haven't had sex. should i be woried? should i wait till my next period and see happens?? ; I would hate to say yes you should be worried but you definitely should be more concerned and vigilant. If I were you I'd definitely go back to my doctor as soon as possible. Ovarian cysts are very serious though sometimes doctors can downplay this fact.

5,"Should all professional sports be banned? ; Professional sports are bad for society, this much is clear.

Has anyone experienced the same/ similar problem as me before that can give me good advice? ; Speed is a great weapon to have.  But if you are unable to use it effectively (such as being unable to finish lay-up's), it becomes more of a hindrance than a strength.  I feel that your concern may not be your strength, rather how you execute your lay-up's.  As a basketball coach, the first thing that is taught to players is that missing lay-up's is a no-no!  That's an easy two and there is no excuse to miss them.  I suggest that when you practice on your own and you miss a lay-up, run a lap from courtside to courtside.  This will serve as a reminder to you not to miss them in the future and the drill also builds your conditioning.",7912

4,"LINUX Distrubution? ; What are the rules or laws for distributing open source applications such as Linux?  I noticed several websites that sell Linux on CD if you don't want to download the application. Do these companies have partnerships or can anyone do this? ; There are a few open source licenses, the two most common are the GNU and BSD.\n\nGNU essentially states the software has to be totally free and you have to share the source code.  Anyone can do anything they want to it as long as they share the source code.  The only expection is that you cannot sell it for a profit.  The places selling linux are not charging for linux, but charging for the medium it comes on and shipping.  If you buy it in store, you are paying for the book, packaging, medium and usually a few months of support.\n\nBSD is a little different, you are free to do what you want with it.  Anyone can take and use the source code and do anything they want with, this includes packaging the code in a software package and selling it.  You also do not have to release the source code.  Two great examples, Windows and OS X.  Windows uses a lot of BSD code for it kernel and OS X uses a ton of BSD code, as the core and more are essentially BSD.  \n\nPersonally, I think the BSD license is crap.

What i was wondering is: Is it possible to take one of the tabs and make an entirely new window with it, or would you have to just open another ie and then go to the web site again?  I know that completely defeats the point of the tabbed browsing, but I wanted to know. ; I'm not totally sure of what you're asking, but I'll give it a go.   We have IE7.  You open IE and your home page, for instance Yahoo, comes up immediately.  If you ""pinned open"" your Favorites list, that also comes up immediately. (Like IE6, you can either have Fav open or closed).\n\nAt this point, the tab in which Yahoo came up is not fixed.  Now, suppose you want to open Yahoo Answers, you can either (1) click on Answers and it replaces the home page in the same tab (so, at this point there is just one tab open, so it's akin to being on IE6 at this point), or (2) you can hold CTRL and then click Answers, which will open a new tab for Answers, or (3) you can click on a blue arrow next to Answers if in your Favorites, which will also open a new tab for Answers.  At this point, there is one tab open with the Yahoo home page and one tab open to Answers. \n\nYou can click and search around under the Yahoo tab without affecting the Answers tab, and vice versa.  It's essentially like having two IE's open at the same time, like you have to do in IE6.  Only it's much faster and once you get the hang of it, much much easier to get around.  For instance, you can be looking at something on a multiple page site and tab it for future viewing (it'll be in it's own tab), yet continue your browsing through that site.

The fact of the matter is that no woman wants to run for president other than hillary. The thing is, women in politics are much more scarce as the field is primarily run by males and it is hard for women to get into a position that could win them the election.\n\nThus far, due to Hillary's presidential background, she is the best woman candidate thus far and the democractic party sees this as a means to run a tough race that might get her elected.\n\nPolitical parties aren't going to vouch for anyone (nominate them for presidency) if they don't think they'll be a viable asset to the party. Typically, parties as a whole will nominate for three reasons: They're easy to use as a pawn, they'll have an easy victory with the people, or they're an all around great person. The chances of the last are rare, and its normal to nominate people that can be viewed by the U.S. Voters as a good vote.

4,"Can someone give me a site for info on creating games? ; i am making a gmae but i have no idea wat to do help me out here. i have to start from nothing send me everything i need to know aboutcreating games. ; First, to create a game, you need to learn something about programming...\n A game is a computer program, so to create a game, you need to program it, or something like this... There are lots of programming languages like: Pascal, Java, C+, C++, Visual Basic, Python etc. With all theese fascinating programming languages you can create lots of cool games... Most games are written in Java. So Java, is a good start...There are also programs which let you create a game without any programming, such as: Game Maker. You can make lots of different kinds of games with it. But theese games are simple. You can't make cool staff with them... This could be a solution if you don't want to learn a programming language. Of course, a real programming language will offer you much more possibilities. The language that is probably used most for games is C and C++. Dev-C++ is a very good (and free) environment to write C/C++ programs in. There are several game libraries you can use with Dev-C++.Another complete system for writing games (for Windows) is the Clean Game Library. It's really cool... Trust me... This is a real programming language, so you will need to write a code. The number of lines you have to write is smaller for example about 3,000 for a game like SAINT NICOLAAS, but the language is very hard to learn. I don't know very much about programming, but if you want to be a good progammer and create lots of games, you need to start by programming, not by simple games creators, or something like this... They're usefull just for begginers... I hope this helped you, a bit...",7969

When you pray and give your troubles to God, LEAVE THEN WITH HIM, otherwise He can do nothing with them. It is just like you and a friend are standing around, and you have an apple, you say to your friend 'here take this apple and eat it', and you friend says 'OK' and reaches for the apple, but you do not let go of it, so your friend starves to death because they could not eat the apple that you would not let go of.

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

Ultimate vengeance is to come from God, and this is a clear example of the principle given often in the Bible:\n\nRomans 12:19 Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\n\nLeviticus 19:18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.\n\nDeuteronomy 32:35 To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.\n\nProverbs 24:29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.\n\nHebrews 10:30 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.\n\nMatthew 7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.\n 2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.\n\nJohn 8:7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.",8027

You'll get toned and fit, and you can do it without joining a gym. Also, aiming for 8- 10 pounds in 2 weeks is not reasonable nor healthy. It can be done, but you will gain back the weight and more afterwards, guaranteed.\n\nMake sure your nutritional needs are met--eat 4-5 small meals a day to keep your metabolism going, and cut down your calories to 1200-1450 per day. Remember that each pound is worth 3500 calories, so aim to burn that off through walking or running, and you can use water jugs at home for arm weights. Jumping rope is also a fast way to burn off calories. Also remember to stay hydrated--at least 108 oz. of water a day. Cut down on sodium and sugar.\n\nNeedless to say, you don't need any equipment for pushups and crunches. Good luck",8040

Unfortunately, there are police officers in Texas who are now going INSIDE bars to breathalyze people and giving public intoxication tickets, even if they did not drive to the bar, and are not driving home. Fortunately, the vast majority of cops will not give a ticket someone riding in a car drunk, if the driver is sober. Usually this will only happen if the intoxicated person is belligerent or aggressive, and disrupting the safety and process of the traffic stop.\nAlso, if the passenger is underage, ANY trace of alcohol will result in at least a ticket for minor consumption.

1,"Explain theory of relativity.? ; please explain it in simplest language.\n\nalso is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nif it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets in it!! ; There are plenty of good websites that answer this question, for any knowledge level. The concept is complex enough that you won’t get a meaningful answer here.\n\nIn horribly oversimplified terms Relativity simply states two things.\n\nOne that there is no universal ‘at rest point’, it all depends on how you choose to define it. You sit in a car doing 100mph and I stand beside the road. Normally we assume that you are in motion and I am at rest. Relativity states that we can just as accurately say that you and the car are at rest and I am moving at 100mph. Alternatively, we normally believe that the Earth orbits the sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. Relativity states that it is just as accurate to say that the Earth orbits the moon and the sun orbits the Earth, or we could say that we all orbit some imaginary point in between all three. It is all a matter of choice what we define as being the fixed point.\n\nThe second is that the speed of light is constant regardless of whether you are at rest or moving, and regardless of how fast you move. If you are sitting in a car doing 9/10 of lightspeed and are going past me standing still beside the road and we both look at exactly the same light beam shining down the road we will both see that light beam travelling away from us at exactly the speed of light relative to both of us. You don’t see it slowed down just because you are travelling almost as fast as it is. It will move away form me just as fast as it moves away form you.\n\nThose are the basics, and they aren’t all that hard to understand, even if they don’t seem to make much sense. What Einstein did was sit down and think really hard about the logical consequences of those two points.\n\n\n>>>>>>also is it true gravity on sun is greater than earth?\n\nYes.\n\n>>>>>if it is so ,sun would have had sucken all planets\n>>>> in it!!\n\n\nNo. Just as the Earth doesn't suck the moon in despite having much higher gravity.\n\nThe planets orbitthe Sun. In simple terms that means they are constantly falling around the sun in a ciruclar pattern.\n\nThe best way I have heard this described for the layman  is to imagine yourself throwing a heavy weight like a shotput. You could only throw it a few metres. Now imagine standingon the roof of a house and throwing that same shotput. This time it will go much further before it hits the gorund. Now go to the top of a rally high cliff and throw it. This time the shotput will travel for 20 or 30 metres before it hits the ground.\n\nThe higher you go the further somehting thrown will travel before it hits the ground. And if you go high enough the object will travel right around the world and back to where it starts before it hits the ground. It will continue falling forever. \n\nThe planets are doing exactly that WRT the sun. We are constantly flaling aorund the sun, but we can't be sucked in because we are falling from such a great height.",8070

P.S we don't live together, don't see each other much, been going out for 8 months now....thank you. ; Leave a little card in his coat pocket or brief case.  Somewhere so when he is at work, he will find it.  Offer to help him clean his house or do yard work.  Offer to join him when he goes to do whatever it is he does as a hobby.  Try to make an effort for your lives to collide more often.  The way I show my boyfriend is by being there for him emotionally when he needs it.  I don't live with him either, but I love to sneak cards in his lunch before he heads off to work.  That way he knows I am thinking about him even when I'm not near him.  I really think if you just find little things to do, he will notice them.",8107

1,"Converting to rational exponents...? ; While the radical symbol is widely used, converting to rational exponents has advantages. Explain an advantage of rational exponents over the radical sign. Include in your answer an example of an equation easier to solve as a rational exponent rather then a radical sign ; Using radicals, imagine the 4th root of x^5 multiplied times the 3rd root of x^4.  &#92;4/x^5 times &#92;3/x^4.\n\nYou cannot just combine them under the same radical.  However, when you rewrite them as exponents to fractional powers, you get:\n\nx^(4/5) * x^(3/4).  Now, you can use the addition of exponents to a common base.  How do you add 4/5 and 3/4?  you get the common denom of 20 and make it 16/20 + 15/20 and get:\nx^(31/20).  How could you have ever known by looking at the radicals that you would have ended up with the 20th root of x^31st power?",8115

We had a nice talk, just chit chat. We didn't talk about relationship stuff. \n\nI then invited him over this week to just hang out and he said he would think about it. I told him that I wouldn't try anything, but he said he wasn't worried about me he was worried about himself (for those of you who don't know he was talking about sex).  He hasn't got back to me about the hanging out thing yet.\n\nBut my dilemma is this.

2,"Naproxen or Ibuprofen?  Which is better for sciatic problems? ; I am experiencing shooting pain when I move ""wrong"" but not all the time. ; Most sciatica pain responds well to self-measures.  You'll heal more quickly if you continue your usual activities but be sure to avoid the move that triggers the pain.  For pain relief, you'll have to see what works best for you.  NSAIDs such as aspirin, naproxen sodium and ibuprofen will alleviate both pain and inflammation.  Acetaminophen alleviates pain only.  But there's a limit as to how much pain these can control.  Make sure your doctor is aware of what you take, how much & how often and how effective it is.  For more severe pain that is unrelieved or inadequately relieved by NSAIDs or Tylenol, your doctor may want to prescribe an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxer, a tricyclic antidepressant or an anticonvulsant.  You can also use the hot-cold method.  When the pain starts, apply ice packs or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel to the affected areas for 15-20 min. 4x a day.  After 48 hrs. apply heat (heating pad on the lowest setting, heat packs commercially sold or a heat lamp).  You can alternate hot and cold if necessary.\n\nGentle stretching for the lower back may relieve nerve root compression and make you feel better but try not to jerk or twist your back.\n\nProlonged rest will worsen your pain.  FYI:  Naprosyn (naproxen sodium) is available over-the-counter.   You don't need a prescription.  And Aleve IS naproxen.",8176

When they tighten them, it doesn't hurt when they do this but your teeth get sore for a couple of days after as that is when they move the most, advil takes away pretty much all the pain though.  The first couple of weeks my braces were on the insides of my lips were cut and raw from rubbing against my brace.  This does go away in time as your mouth just gets used to them.  In the meantime, if you put the wax on your braces, it keeps them from rubbing on the inside of your mouth so much but it is a little funny feeling.  They will give you special stuff to use to floss and show you how to use it.  I don't remember the spacers hurting, I could be wrong but if they did hurt it was not bad enough that I remember.  The only thing I couldn't really eat was gum and really chewy candy, but there were some things I had to cut up instead of just taking a bite out of like apples and such.

1,"Next Solar System moon to be discovered after Galileo found Io, Ganymede, Europa & Callisto? When? By whom? ; Was it another moon of Jupiter? Or one orbiting another planet in the Solar System? Was it soon afterwards? Or did the Church's condemnation of Galileo's findings inhibit more research from taking place for a long time? ; Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, and after Ganymede, the second-largest moon in the Solar System. Discovered by Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer on March 25th, 1655 about 45 years later than Galielo's discovery of 7th January 1610.\n\nTwo generations later suggests to me that the church did inhibit research. Telescopes existed, and the thought that if Jupiter had moons, then Saturn might have them, too, must have occurred to the astronomers of the day, Perhaps it inhibited publication more than research? Another factor to consider is that Holland was also less under the sway of Roman Catholicism than Italy had been for Galileo.\n\nHuygens named his discovery simply Saturni Luna (Latin for ""Saturn's moon"", which can also be written Luna Saturni) (De Saturni Luna observatio nova, 1656; XV). Later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus) Lodoicea Sidera (""the stars of Louis"") to honour king Louis XIV.\n\nThe name ""Titan"" and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, wherein he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used.\n\nJupiter was the Roman equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and Saturn the Roman equivalent of Zeus' father, Cronos (Zeus' mother was Rhea, the name given to another of Saturn's moons).\n\nThe Huygens spacecraft and Cassini probe that explored Titan in 2004 were named after these two astronomers.",8345

2,"summer weight loss!!!!? ; I am an 11th grader and I weight about 232lbs. we tke senior pics during the summer(july) before 12th grade year. is it possible to lose 100lbs before then? if so can you please tell me how  Thanks ; You can lose a lot of weight between now and the summer if you work at it a little.   If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity. This is it.",8397

The more closely you read it the more 'goodies' for various interest groups jump out that weren't even covered in news of the debates.  \n\nAlso, what seems to be holding it up is the guest worker/amnesty discussion.\n\nWhile this discussion continues, the border remains open.  Many have suggested that we at least pass a simple border security bill, not changing penalties or more rigidly criminalizing anyone, for now, and work the rest out at a pace that allows the hard questions to be looked at.  \n\nMe, if I actually had border security would support legalization for screened illegals. However, my concern is total numbers. Schools in border states are already foundering, and I think the guest worker program to keep wages permenantly depressed, on top of amnesty, is too much. They are trying to hard to give everyone everything without stopping to evaluate impact.\n\nWould you support border security first, then figure out the rest? ; I think this is the approach that SHOULD be taken.  How can you even consider guest worker programs or amnesty or ANYTHING, until you have a way to control the #'s?\n\nI too would be FAR more interested in considering some leniency for those here if I was convinced that they would be the LAST coming (from ANYWHERE).\n\nWe are the only country that does NOT have secured borders (and I do not just mean Mexcicans.

2,"What are kegel balls? ; Do they work? ; Incontinence device that you do excercises with.\n\nIncontinence is sometimes temporary, caused by pregnancy, a urinary tract infection, a vaginal infection, constipation or some specific medications. But incontinence can also be caused by muscular problems, changes in the pelvic region after childbirth, a hormone imbalance, or a neurologic disorder. Kegel exercises are the typical prescription whatever the case. \n\nOriginally Kegel exercises were done just by women after childbirth to rebuild the vaginal muscles and help with stress incontincence. Later Dr. Kegel discovered that muscle weakness could be found in most women over 40, causing pelvic discomfort, bladder dysfunction and sexual disturbances. From that he concluded that all women should be doing a variable resistance pelvic floor muscle exercise for their general health.\n\nMost women who just ""do"" kegels usually have minimal results due to the lack variable resistance and no feedback to determine if they are doing the exercise properly. The most common problem is contraction of the abdominal muscles at the same time as the PC muscle. When this occurs the abdominal muscles (which are bigger and stronger) push down on the pelvic floor and can actually make the problem worse. \n\nI have never used so I can't tell you firsthand.",8414

9,"British/American Politics? ; In Britain the Tory Party represents Big Business, the Labour Party says it represents the People(Debatable) And the Liberals can't make there minds up, what's the equivalent in America?. ; Good question. Anerican politics can be very complicated.\n\nGenerally, the Republican Party can be seen as the equivalent to the ""Tories"", the Democratic Party can be seen as the equivalent to Labour, although the American spectrum is a little bit more to the right. From what I've heard about the modern Liberal party, they are probably equivalent to Libertarians- although it's hard to peg your Liberal party down on the political spectrum.\n\nBut until the 1960's, it wasn't that cut and dry. The Democrats had many Conservatives in the south and elsewhere. And the Republicans had many liberals/moderates in the Northeast. The Republicans, after all, were the ones who freed the slaves during the Civil War. The Democrats, as a matter of fact, encouraged the formation of the KKK as a means of intimidating republicans(most of the Republicans in the south after the civil war were black ).\n\nBut even with those contradictions, the Democrats have almost always been perceived as more of ""the people's party"" and the Republicans have been more of a ""Pro-Business"" party.\n\nAs I said, the 60's and the Nixon ""Southern Strategy"" sort of caused a realignment. Conservatives moved to the GOP(Republican party) and liberals moved to the Democrats- although the seeds of this were already in each party, and there had been a slow drift both ways throughout the 20th century.",8446

You base your 2006 estimated taxes on your total Federal income taxes paid for 2005.  This is a safe harbor, you may (probably) will wind up still owing 4/15/07.

1,"Importance of limiting reagents? ; Why is it important to have a limiting reagent when performing a lab experiment? and why is it not simpler to make both reactions go to completion? ; In some cases, when the reaction rate is fast, and the reaction goes all the way to completion, one uses the stoichiometric amounts necessary to convert all of reactants.  But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.  So, you use a large excess of one of the reactants, which causes all, or almost all, of the other reactant to be converted.",8475
1,"How can I design a BKU chiller heat exchanger? ; Any sample calculations would be useful to calculate the LMTD and heat transferred ; When you say you want to design a chiller, I assume you mean the process design not the mechanical design. \n\nThe amount of heat being transferred is a given based on the process requirements. \n\nSince this is a BKU the shell side temperature both in and out will be the temperature of the refrigerant ""bath"" therefore the LMTD calculation is pretty straight forward.\n\nThe inlet and outlet temperatures on the tube side are also process design requirement and fixed by the process. \n\nThe actual materials of construction have very little to do with the actual sizing of the exchanger. Knowing the overall heat transfer coefficient is more a factor of the boiling liquid on the shell side and any condensing on the tube side. Velocity through the tubes is also a main factor.\n\nThe actual calculations are a trial and error method, because of this there are many computer programs to do the calculation for you. To attempt to provide a set of useful sample calculations on this site is not possible. You have to assume a tube size, number of tubes, tube length, tube arrangement, tube spacing and an acceptable pressure on the tube side.",8476

This said, there are situations when the uprgade is required because some mission critical-piece of hardware or software that the client just acquired requires Windows XP.

You are very wise grasshopper....Hmmmm....A product to Market?  I can think of several products that you could market.....I'll give you one....\n\nYou could market ""Countertop Water Distillers.""  I just bought one myself and I use it everyday.  A distiller turns bad tap water into pure water if you do it right.  The method is to filter your tap water through activated charcoal,  then distill it, and then filter it one more time through activated charcoal. This will pretty much give you absolute pure drinking water.  I paid about $135.00 for distiller that I bought\n\nNow....I'll go a step further and help you with your ""sales pitch.""\n\nThat fact is....there is no such thing as ""good tap water"" anymore. I don't care where you live or how good your tap water taste.  Here's the reality.....All tap water comes from either rain or snow.  The Board of Water Supply harnesses the water and adds a bunch of chemicals to it to make it safe. Then they pump it to the customers.  Right?   Ok....but......realize this....\n\nAll rain is ""Acid Rain""  There is so much pollution in our atomshere that it doesn't matter where you live. A lot of it comes from China, Asia, Europe and the United States. This ""Acid Rain""  or  ""Snow""  contains 100's of different harmful chemicals.\nOnce it makes contact with the ground it starts to pick up more chemicals.  Like Pesticides and Animal Feces. The water will also pick up ""Minerals.""  However they are mostly ""Depleted Minerals""  that only cause ""Gull Stones"" and  ""Kidney Stones."" \n\nFinally, the water flows to the  ""Board of Water Supply.""  Their  routine is to dump as much ""Bleach"" as it takes ...to ""override"" and ""kill"" all the other  Bacteria and Chemicals that are in the water.  Bam!  Finished Product!  Drink up! \n\nThe reason why so many people say they have good tap water where they live.... is because they have grown so used to the taste.  \n\nI thought I had good drinking water were I lived ....but....After I purchased my distiller and drank ""pure water"" for a month....I went back and tasted the water right out my tap. I could really taste the difference.  Big Time.  It was like drinking ""Swimming Pool"" water. I couldn't believe the difference and I will only drink  distilled water for the rest of my life.\n\nGood Luck on your assignment....and you better give me best answer.....Ha!...Ha!.....lol.",8546

6,"Why was the battle of Saratoga importent? ; Ined to know exacly y Saratoga battle was importent ; The Battle(s) of Saratoga were considered by many historians to have been the turning point of the American Revolutionary War and one of the most decisive battles in history. The defeat and capture of a major British military force in the Saratoga campaign by American revolutionary forces secured the northern American colonies from attacks out of Canada. It also convinced the rulers of France that it was worth extending the full measure of their military, political, and diplomatic support to the rebel American colonies.\n\nA force of roughly 10,000 men were trapped, mostly British regulars under General ""Gentleman Johnny"" Burgoyne. Burgoyne had advanced from French Canada in the summer of 1777 with the intention of taking Albany, New York, and cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies by seizing control of the Hudson River Valley. In the spring, the British had seized colonial forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga. The Americans retreated. However, a successful colonial delaying action comprising the systematic blocking of roads, destruction of bridges, and harassment of British troops with sniper fire slowed the British advance beyond the southern ends of Lakes Champlain and George to a few kilometers a day. Burgoyne's force was eventually blocked by colonial regular soldiers and militia under General Horatio Gates in the area north of the Hudson Valley town of Saratoga. Over the course of the summer, the colonial force grew to roughly 15,000 men.",8555

That is the nerve that controls the facial musculature, including eye lids.  So the first question is, do you think you have a normal blinking pattern in the affected eye.  Compare it with the normal eye.  If both eyes are tearing, that is less likely due to Bell's as that is a local and thus one-sided process.  Additionally, the facial nerve carries nerve impulses to the lacrimal or tear glands, so it may be at work here, but again that would usually be a one one sided process. \n\nAs far what to do about the tears...manually blink your eye using the back of your finger at regular intervals, and especially when it feels dry.  If blinking is not a problem, or if the tearing continues, I'd see an ophthalmologist.  Hope that helps.",8574

Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner.

1,"what is ""maxwell's deamon""? ; it may be related to James Clerk Maxwell or physics (perhaps electromagnetism) ; Maxwell's demon is a thought experiment. Take a room full of ordinary air at a temperature of, say, 300 kelvin. Now, 300 kelvin means that the molecules of the air are moving with a certain speed - the faster they move, the hotter it is. Well, not all molecules in the room are moving with the same speed. Some of them are faster (""hotter"") and some are slower (""colder""). What Maxwell's demon is apparently capable of doing is sort all the fast molecules into one end of the room and all the slow ones into the other end, thus making an oven in one end and a freezer in the other! What Maxwell's point about this is that this can't be done without expending more energy than is gained by this ordering of thermal energy. In other, more precise, words, the entropy cannot decrease.",8605

If something appeals to you take an upper level course in that subject. Also visit your college's career center. They will have assessments that you can take to help you discover what careers are best suited for your interests. They should also have resources there that will allow you to see what careers are expected to have openings and what to expect. Finally, volunteer and/or do an internship.

If they are not compatible, what is it that they are not? Please identify some example issues. Thanks. ; I find, as both a member of the ACLU and a Christian, that they are perfectly compatible.  Quite frankly, the only people it is not compatible with are the highly conservative ""Christian"" extremists, a la Falwell and Robertson.  Quite frankly, they merely use Christianity as an excuse for bigotry and hatred.  Ironically enough, historically, those people who you and I would really identify as acting in a Christian manner are those on the forefront of the progressive movement today.  For instance, the Christians who were anti-slavery in the 1850's, or those working for desegregation in the 1950's.  The fundamentalists were on the opposite sides back then.  If Robertson was alive in the 1850's I have no doubt whatsoever that he would be pro-slave. After all, there is much more biblical teaching that is pro-slavery than there is anti-gay.",8640

1,"Trigonometry Help? ; Using the unit circle, find the value of the trigonometric functions: \n\ntan pi/6.\n\nsec 3pi/2 ; Well, convert pi/6 to degrees (30) and 3pi/2 (270)\n\nObviously you have a 30,60,90 degree triangle in the first case. Tangent is the opposite side over the adjacent. The side opposite a 30 degree angle is 1. Adjacent would be sqrt(3). Thus tan pi/6 is 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3\n\nSame thing for the secant. 270 has a reference angle of 90, so another 30,60,90 triangle. But remember, secant is 1/cos.

4,"What is the safest way to backup your digital photos ? ; Should I use DVD-R, external harddrives ... what will secure my photos 20 years from now when I want to look at photos of my kids growing up ? ; Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Hard drives have a MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) bascially this means that they will fail within a certain time or at least produce bad sectors making some of your data unrecoverable(ish). One way to try to protect data on your PC is to have a RAIDED system that means 2 or more identical drives and hardware or software replicates the software across each drive so if one drive goes down you still have your data. This does not help if the PC goes on fire or gets water damaged, you should always have a seperate backup procedure.\n\n2. DVD's are a good way of backing up your data and I would say are a more reliable way of backing up rather than Hard disks but they are limited to 4.7GB (single sided). What I do is burn a backup every week or whenever I do a big change of data but this is dependant on the old saying ""What happens if your Hard Disk died in 5 minutes would you miss any data on it"" if yes do a daily Backup. 99% of IT companies only backup there data every day so backing up every few hours is a bit extreme but again if it is critical do a backup. Buy quality DVD's!\n\n3. USB memory sticks are pretty tough bits of kit and you can give them quite a bit of grief before they fail, USB sticks use memory chips rather than magnetic media like hard disks and tend to be a little bit more robust. They can get corrupted just like any other device.\n\n4. Zip disks are a bit old hat and have the same problem as floppy disks avoid avoid avoid! Trust me I have used them and relied too much on them and lost data cos of it.\n\n5. Tape backups (DDS3/4/DAT72) have a good capacity and alot of IT companies use this type of backup but again they are suseptable to corruption similar to floppy disks if kept for any length of time as they are magnetic media, expensive to maintain.\n\n6. SD/MMC cards are similar technology to USB memory sticks as they store the data on a chip(s) but do not normally have the capacity to store alot of data (1GB?) and are very easily lost/broken as they are so small.\n\n7. Online backups are an option but most are insecure and do you want people to have access to your data/photos etc. hmmmm\n\nI suppose there is no 100% safe way of backing up your data (and keeping it safe) but I have found DVD's to be pretty good (using quality DVD's with dark ink), I use DVD-RW as my data changes alot and there is no point in me keeping the old stuff but buy high quality DVD's as cheap and nasty DVD's tend to develop problems later in life.\nI have seen alot of testing done on USB sticks and they have been found to be very tough to break.\n\nIf you are serious about the data you can buy a small fire proof safe as well.\n\nJust my opinon and experience!",8709

2,"What foods are good for a diet? ; I am trying to loose weight and i want to know what food i can eat! Does Chicken work?? does fruit work? HELP! ; Most people eat way too many starches and sugars (in other words carbs). There is a diet (if you want specifics just send me an e-mail) basically you are allowed 3 meals a day and one snack.  Each meal gets 2-3 carbs and snacks get 1-2 (you can figure carbs by looking on nutrition label taking what it has for caarbohydrates and dividing it by 15, for instance if its 32 thats roughly 2 servings of carbs).  Also for each meal you eat 3-5 oz of lean meat or 1 whole egg or 1 whole egg and 1 egg white or 3 egg whites.  You have unlitmited veggies. This meal plan is flexible enough that you dont necessary have to eat ""diet"" foods but puts portions back to where they were in the 1970s when there wasnt such a huge obesity problem.\n\nWith any diet you need to exercise. I suggest the following plan, it is not too difficult that if you are very over weight you will be uncapable of doing it (these are the times you should start at, add 5 minutes each week to the total time, until you hit around 80 min on the walk):\nDay 1: walk 40 min\nDay 2: walk 10 min, jog 5, walk 10, jog 5, walk 10, jog 5 (when you add time to these add a min to the jog a week, nothing else)\nDay 3: get 10 lb weights, do a chest press, curls and stand on a step holding the weights and do calf raises. Each should be 3 sets of 10 reps for first month then go to 12 reps and after that do 15 reps\nDay 4: rest\nDay 5: Cardio(choose 1): jog 15 min, jump rope 10, walk 50, swim 15, trampoline 15, sport 20, etc.\n\nthen repeat.  Note: if it is raining outside you can shuffle the days.  You should also do 15-20 pushups a night and 50-100 situps",8713

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788
1,"Bernoulli Differential equation? ; I need to solve these 2 questions:\n\n1. Find the solution to the following diff. equation\n(x+y)dy/dx + y = 0\nthe answer should be y^2+2xy=C\n\n2. Wich is the solution to the following differential equation?\ndy/dx - (1/x)y = -xy^2\nthe answer should be x/(2x^2 + C)\n\nI tried working them according to what the book shows me but get stuck. I used Q(x)= -x  P(x)= -1/x\nlet n = 2\n\nWho can help? ; 1. Solving for dy/dx gives dy/dx = -y/(x+y), but this doesn't fit the form of the Bernoulli equation.  Instead, flip it around and get dx/dy + (1/y)x = -1, so n=0, P(y)=1/y, and Q(y)=-1.  In this case, there's no need for a change of variable, so instead just jump directly to using the integrating factor m(y) = e^(integral of 1/y) = y, to get\n\ny dx/dy + x = -y, so (xy)' = -y.  Therefore\n\nx = (1/y) (-y^2/2 + C), or x = -y/2 + C/y.\n\nMultiply through by 2y: 2xy + y^2 = 2C, which is equivalent to the solution you expect, since C is an arbitrary constant.\n\n2. Since n=2, let v = y^(1-n) = 1/y.  After transforming, you get \n\ndv/dx + vp(x) = q(x)\n\nwhere p(x) = (1-n)P(x) = 1/x and q(x) = (1-n)Q(x) = x, so you're solving\n\ndv/dx + (1/x)v = x.\n\nNow use the integrating factor x, and  you have\n\nx dv/dx + v = x^2\n\nso (vx)' = x^2, or v = (1/x)(x^3/3 + C), so\n\nv = x^2 / 3 + C/x.  But v = 1/y, so \n\ny = 1 / (x^2/3 + C/x) = x / (x^3/3 + C).\n\nThis doesn't agree with what you're saying the answer should be, but it does satisfy the differential equation (as I confirmed by plugging in this solution), whereas your answer doesn't.",8789

2,"how to lose weight? ; i am 11 years old and my weight is 40 kg ; It surprises many people how much weight they can lose in just one week if they start paying attention to exactly how they live their lives. Because most of us have such fast paced, busy lives we tend to do the things that are most convenient, but often this is not what is best for our bodies. Fast food, frozen food, and very little exercise is what is usually most convenient. Luckily, there are ways to make eating healthier and to even fit in some exercise, even if you are one of the very busy!\n\nFirst, you need to look at your diet. Sometimes the things that lead to us being over weight are things that we just take for granted or don’t even really think about. Oddly enough, the biggest culprits are not what we even have to chew we simply have to swallow! Drinks! When you are thirsty and you need to grab something quick you just go to the fridge or the soda machine and crack open that can or bottle of soda. While the soda is mildly refreshing, it’s also packed with calories. If you are drinking even two or three regular sodas per day you’ll find that you are adding anywhere from 600 to 1,000 extra calories every day. If you cut out the regular soda you’ll find that the pounds will start dropping within a couple days. Many people find that they can easily lose up to 20 pounds over the course of just a few months when they stop drinking soda, but the initial weight loss is seen the first week.

Are you asking if somone could get into more trouble than normal for not paying their debt when it's in the hundereds of thousands, verus let's say someone with only a few thousands dollars debt?\n\nDebt is debt is debt.  If you take out a credit card, no matter what your credit limit is, you're supposed to pay it back according to the terms of the credit card company.  If you don't, the credit card company has a couple of different options.  For a small amount, they could simply write the debt off on their taxes at the end of the year and forget it.  Or, they could sell the debt to someone else, and the someone else could try to collect it (phone calls, letters, etc).  In either case, it's probably going to show up on your credit report, and your credit would suffer the normal 7 years.  In some cases, these ""debt buyers"" post the debt as of the day they buy it, and it could stay on your credit for alot longer than just 7 years.\n\nThe credit card company could also take you to small claims court (depending on how much you owe and what the limit for your state is) and get a judgment.  Here's where things get tricky.  If the credit card company wins in small claims, they could (1) take money out of your bank account (2) garnish your wages (3) they could take any of your personal property that isn't considered ""exempt"" in your state (car, RV, motorcycle, etc) or (4) if there's enough debt, they could call for a foreclosure on your home.  And all of this without your permission.\n\nThink twice before getting more credit than you can afford.  It could haunt you for a very, very long time.",8860

They explain the actions of what middle eastern people use to do when they were idolitors and heathans by saying that they just got confused and it was really done ""this way"" by Abraham or Moses or... etc for this and that reason. They pray five times a day. One of the two I know HATES white people... and ctually hates almost everything.

I am 29 and know from experience that in NYC most men don't get married until their 30s because of the large population of young, attractive available women.

I am too old to take such a huge risk.   What is the possibility that this works in NYC?

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

As long as you are going through a complete check up, such ultrasound will be done to see what is going on in there inside you - to assess your body parts which cannot just be assessed by any method of examinations. The doctor will look at your body system parts such as uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, kidney, bladders, ureters. \n\nI am not sure of what your real condition is but I suggest there maybe  some things the doctor wants to clarify - perhaps the doctor noted  some doubtful or suspicious clues which need to be verified by ultrasound.♥",8913

Pratka contracted with ABC Contractors, a Houston firm, to clean up the damage and rebuild the house. The contract was for $100,000 and Pratka paid the contractor half of the money up front. Unfortunately, ABC did not live up to the agreement. The contractor failed to finish the work and much of the work it did will have to be redone. Pratka has now decided to go to court ; The violation of the contract would be a civil matter. If, however, there was fraud (as often is the case with some ""contractors"" after a disaster) then that would be a criminal matter.",8980
0,"The ""ELECT"", what  does it mean? ; The Bible talks about the ""elect""....what does this mean to you? Who do you think the ""elect' are?\nIs this the same as the ""chosen""....??? ; In Christianity, the category of ""the elect"" is tricky because it engages theological differences between different strains of Christianity regarding the exact interaction of free will (which is essential to Christian ethics) and God's foreordained determination of all history (which is essential to Christian cosmology), which have appeared at times to some Christian theologians to have a paradoxical relationship.\n\nFor Calvinists, for example, God has chosen the elect at the beginning of time and whether one chooses to embrace Christian salvation or reject it is on one hand a form of free will, but beneath that and more fundamentally is an expression of God's predetermination of all choices.  In the Roman Catholic tradition, the ""elect"" is more oriented toward free will, and means both those chosen by God and those who have chosen God, which are understood to be coextensive spheres.  In the Fundamentalist tradition, the term elect primarily is used to contrast those who are saved with those who are damned, and is a preferentialist term.\n\nYes, elect and chosen are the same in the contemporary Christian context--although the original Biblical meaning of ""the chosen"" had to do with the Jewish people, which is not at all the same as ""the elect.""",8981

0,"WHICH IS SUPERIOR, a culture that forces the separation of the sexes (ISLAM) or a normal culture? ; The is an important question. Muslims believe their culture is superior to all others and that the world should be forced by them to live the same. \n\nMuslims believe in single-sex lifestyles where men and woman are separated as much as possible with the exception of the homeplace of married people. Some Islamic countries even have norms where the separation continues inside the house (separate womans living room, etc).\n\nCould this be the superior culture? Is it better for the world to banish female beauty from public? What happens when men are forced to spend so much time together, does incest and homosexuality rates explod like in all Islamic countries?\n\nMuslims usually answer this with a question ""You want someone looking at YOUR sister or mother!!"" \n\nIf I viewed my mother or sister as possessions, as opposed to humans without needs and free will, then I suppose I would cover them like furniture or put them in storage but I would now be worried about uncle Ali's incest. ; Like anybody is really going to read your rant.

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

Small bone structure will obviously weight less.  And since muscle weighs more than fat, a more muscular person will weigh more than the same physical size person with a higher % bodyfat.  My guess is your sister sounds like she is pretty thin, with a small bone structure and not much muscle mass.

By looking at how the human brain responds to ""fullness"" messages sent to the brain by an implanted device that stimulates the stomach, the scientists have identified brain circuits that motivate the desire to overeat in the obese -- the same circuits that cause addicted individuals to crave drugs. The scientists have also verified that these circuits play a critical role in eating behaviors linked to soothing negative emotions.

I think I've gained about 25 lbs since.  Do you think it's the menopause and Temoxifen combined?  I'm 5'4 & weight about 180...I should be at 135!  Am I ever going to be that weight again? ; I do understand what you are going through.  You may not ever get back to that 135 pounds, but you can get closer to it.  The drugs make it harder, and menopause may have some effect.  But there are things you can do.\n\nIf you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose some weight. You may know that you need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need at least 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Be very conscious of your nutrition.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym.   I'd go the gym route at least to start, if you have never done weight training before.  Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.\n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss. \n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4. even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\n8.  Did your oncology team ever refer you to a dietician?   That may help you.   Also talk to them about your weight concerns and get their opinions.  \n\nI hope these thoughts help. You can do this. Good luck with it.",9143

1,"String Theory? ; Is string theory crazy enough to be correct? It seems the more incredible we find the universe to be, the more far-fetched the theories become, the more believable they are. ; ""crazy"" is not really a reliable indicater. If I theorize atoms are miniature frogs, and forces are the results of their tiny tongues shooting out at tiny flies, that is crazy but (probably) not correct.\n\nActually, the basic idea of string theory not only makes sense but is pretty natural. The craziness comes in when they follow up the results of those initial ideas.\n\nIn traditional partical physics elementary particles like electrons and quarks are assumed to be point particles - that is, to have qualities like mass and charge, but to have a size of literally 0. This is a simplification that works well, but a size of 0 doesn't make much sense to me, at least. String theory assumes that those particles are not points but have a structure, and then tries to determine what it can about those structures.\n\nWeirdness from simple assumptions is not restricted to string theory. Quantum physics also starts from a simple, one-line assumption and builds a large, weird, and ultimately very useful theory from it. \n\nWhat interests me is that there are 3 possibilities: string theory could be right, and could be the long-desired ""theory of everything""; it could be wrong, in which case lots of scientists have wasted lots of time and effort developing a beautiful but worthless theory; or it could be right like Newtonian physics is right, useful in many calculations but only under certain restrictions.",9146
2,"New job and a persistant bacterial infection dilema... read for more details? ; I got sick on October 16th and ended up in the ER unable to breathe and was throwing up.  The doctor examined me and said I had a bacterial infection of my lungs, sinuses, larynx, and ears.  He prescribed z-pak and I was sent home for a week of bed rest.  The next week I returned to my full time student status at the local university with a still really run down feeling.  Being optimistic, I reinterviewed for my old job as a seasonal full time employee (Circuit City).  That weekend, I started once again feeling horrible and returned to urgent care on Monday.  The doctor this time prescribed Levaquin.  After I took it for 4 days, I pretty much lost the ability to focus my eyes and to keep down anything but yogurt.  I finished my prescription neverless since my doctor said it wasn't an allergic reaction.  I finished my pills this past Friday and was offered a job on Saturday.  Again, I am prematurely optimistic because my symptoms are once again returning.  I'm suppose to start work ; Run, don't walk somewhere that sells good probiotics.(any health food store will have them in their fridge, if you can't find them ask)\n  You have had two major rounds of antibiotics. ABX  nuke all the bacteria in your system, including the good ones.  The ""bad"" ones tend to reproduce more quickly than the ones that are beneficial to us. To rebuild those quicker than the ones that cause problems, you help them out by orally taking some. \nAcidolpholus and bifidus are two of them. There is lactobaccilus as well as a handful of others. If there are 3 or 4  kinds, that's not a bad thing.\n I take them on a semi regular basis, as well as any time I have taken ABX in the last 10 years. If I don't, I get sinus and yeast infections for weeks afterward.\nThe way to figure out if your probiotics are still alive is to break a capsule into a little cup of milk and leave it in the fridge over night. If it's thick like yogurt in the morning, they're good. If not, if it's thin like milk, then they aren't working any more.  A bottle at the health food store should run between $10-15. . \nYou'll need to go to a health food store or order online to get good probiotics. Get the kind that have to be refrigerated, not tablets that don't have to be kept cold.  The ones that have to be kept cold are better quality.\nIn addition to taking probiotics, eat less simple carbs. There is a ""candida diet"" out there that is supposed to help your body not support candida overgrowth, which is what multiple or recurring  infections sounds like to me, esp when more than one round of ABX is involved. I'm not a doc, I've just been there too many times before I found out about probiotics.\nThat diet I mentioned, cuts out simple carbs, and limits complex carbs at first. Then you find your own balance that your body can tolerate. \nhere are a couple of links to different varieties of that diet...\nhttp://altmedicine.about.com/od/popularhealthdiets/a/candidadiet.htm\nhttp://candidapage.com/candiet.txt\n  \nhth",9147

8,"I've been secretly admiring a girl on-and-off for 10 years. what shd i do? ; This girl was my secondary school classmate. We used to know each other only barely. But God knows how many times i peeped at her during lesson instead of looking at the board. However, i was a shy boy (though still is) and the fact is that she had boyfriends one after another THROGHT OUT the teen years. and God know how many times i felt sour and my heart sank whenever i saw her with her guy(s).\n\nDuring the poly years, i had a girlfriend and she was having a relatively more committed relationship. so my heart was with my girl at the time and hence u can only say that i have been a secret admirer ""on-and-off"" for 10 years.\n\nOFF, is when i have a gf, my heart have no one else. and even when i'm single, i won't fall for a girl who is attached.\n\nON, is for the times when we were both unattached. it kind of give me hope bcoz she is available. For the past 10 years, i never take any action for these ""on"" periods. \n\nFor the past 2 months, we kind of reconnect our communication. Bcoz i'm studying in uni now and she is working, we have chance to chat for few hours daily on MSN. (mon-fri working hours only though, coz she don't usually use msn at home)\n\nFrom recent chats, \nshe told me that she is now single, and she mentioned that she is not a late-queen for dates nowadays. \nAnd after she know that i used to have one painful and hurtful relationship, she said that ppl have to move on and ""if there's a good girl whom u like then give it a try"" \nShe also claims that she only regard herself who had only 2 relationships coz sec sch histores are just childish ones.\n\nWe talked a lot rubbish, shared a lot of views, joked a lot and ""suan"" each other a lot and i feel (or maybe only i feel)that we start to have some connection.\n\nSo, last week, i managed to find some courage a said.. \n\n""you wrote on my sec sch autograph book that i can call u anytime, so.. can i call u tonight??"" \n\nbut she replied ""lol.. i have a dinner appointment tonight."" \n\nI was rather disappointed. I thought, if she doesn't mind me calling she would have state a time or sth. \n\nBut soon after, she said ""next time we catch up with a movie, after your exam?"", ""when your exam finish?"", ""talk is cheap, fix a date now""....\n\nso, our tentative date (or sec sch class monitor-monitress re-union if putting it mildly) is 3 dec!! just 2 days aft my exam. But the point is that we only chat on MSN and have not advanced into phone-talk and constant sms-es.\n\nI keep thinking of her recently. and thinking..\nShd i postpone it? coz i just had a bad haircut.\nwhat shd i say? how shd i behave? will i just blush and panic? is that anything in my walldrode that can match her smile and style? shd i pay for everything? where shd we eat?? It's not like i don't have experience.\nAlthough i had gf before. But this time is different. She is a special person to me. (else i won't admire her for a decade\nSo now i'm like completely anxious and excited at the same time.\n\nShe is a very pretty girl to me. i looked at her that way for the past 10 years. so it's not like i'm saying this coz she is grown up now and having her own fashion taste.\n\nBut i have a low esteem of myself. coz i don't think i have the look. and that i'm just a poor student who owes the bank loan of $18k.\n\nThe tough point here for me is: \nIS there another guys who express interest in her?\nDOES she already has someone in mind?\nwhen shd i tell her my feelings? the feelings that have been kept inside me for 10 years?\nShould i buy her a present (and say it's christmas present) for that day?\nShould i just write a love letter and confess everything?

It is just not that serious for this girl.  She probably sees you as an old school chum she would not mind spending an evening with sometime.  \n\nIt seems to me that you need to move on with your life and get out more.  Consider it just a date.  I thought only women thought things through this deeply when it came to relationships.  Hearing a man confess to such flights of whimsy (the gift, the love note confession, et' all) is a little creepy to be honest.  Sensitive is nice, obsessive is just creepy.  You sound obsessive, or at least quite immature and inexperienced.  Almost a stereotype of, well, an engineering student.  \n\nDon't confess undying love.  Don't buy a gift.  Don't write the love note.  Don't sweat the haircut.  Just pick her up.  Take her to dinner, enjoy the moment, escort her home and tell her you'd like to see her again.  \n\nYou've waited 10 years, so you have time.  Get to know her.

All numbers are in degrees ; cos(a+b) = cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) \nand \nsin(a+b) = sin(a) cos(b) + sin (b) cos(a)\n\nSo first expand sin(x + 150°) into sin(x)cos(150°) +sin(150°)cos(x)\nand expand cos(x + 120°) into cos(x)cos(120°) - sin(x)sin(120°).\nnow sin (150°) is 1/2 and cos(150°) is sqrt(3)/2, sin(120°) is sqrt(3)/2 and cos(120°) is 1/2. So you have cos x - sqrt(3)/2(sin x) - 1/2cos(x) + 1/2cos x - sqrt(3)/2 sin x = cos x -sqrt(3)sin x. I assume you followed the same steps and mixed up a minus sign.

1,"How can relativity theory relate relatively to the mass defects of  atoms? ; mass change in the electrons ; ""23. MASS AND ENERGY \n  \n   The best known and the most used part of the theory of relativity, which in essence does not belong to this theory, refers to the field of physics which deals with the questions of mass and energy of bodies, as well as the questions of mutual relation of mass and energy. Many physicists strongly believe that the correctness of the theory of relativity is proved in the best and most convincing way just in this sphere. \n   The theory of relativity and its author became as popular as they are thanks to the realization of some possibilities predicted by this ""theory"". These unusual predictions referred to the possibility of obtaining huge amounts of energy through transforming mass into energy, which was later realized in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. With the explosion of the first nuclear bomb the popularity of Albert Einstein and his theory increased enormously. Many, those poorly informed, unjustifiably believe Einstein to be a creator of atom bomb. \n   In classical physics mass and energy are two completely different notions, which cannot be related. According to the theory of  relativity mass and energy are one and the same, but in different forms of existence. Mass can be changed into energy, and likewise energy into mass. If a body gains energy, then its mass is increased, and if it looses energy its mass decreases. Hence, mass is greater when a body is moving than when the body is at rest, it is greater when a body is heated than when it is cold, etc. \n  \n23.1 The classical way of determining the masses of an electron in motion \n  \n   The study of electrons in motion established, first in theory, and later by experiment, that its mass changes depending on its speed. Long before the theory of relativity, in his theory on electromagnetism, published in 1892, Lorentz laid the greatest significance on the question of the interdependence of an electron's mass and its speed. While moving, the electron as an electrically charged particle creates an electromagnetic field which surrounds its. The faster the electron moves, the greater the resistance of that electromagnetic field to further increase of electron's speed. The effect is the same as if with the increase of speed the electron's mass increases. That is why that mass was named ""electromagnetic mass"". \n   In 1901 Kaufmann [W. Kaufmann, Gesell. Wiss. Gött. Nachr. 143, 291, 1901.; W. Kaufmann, Physik Zeitschr. 4, 55, 1902.] experimentally confirmed that an electron's mass increases with the increase of its speed. Using an electrical field to accelerate the motion of an electron and an electric field as also a magnetic field to divert the electron from its direction of motion, Kaufmann found that the mass of the electron increases in relation to its speed and that the electron has two masses, the so called transversal mass and the longitudinal mass. These findings caused a great surprise among physicists since, to that point, only one mass was known. The longitudinal mass of the electron resists increases in velocity in the direction of its motion as mass does in classical physics. The transversal mass of the electron, however, resists the deviation of the electron from its direction of motion. \n   In classical physics there is only one mass. For example, in rotary motion a body will tend to move at a tangent to the circle, because that is, at every moment, its direction of movement. However, centripetal force compels it to move in a circle. Centrifugal force and also centripetal force are the result of the resistance of the transversal mass to move in a circle. At first sight it seems that every body has two masses, longitudinal and transversal. In the case of an ordinary body, however, these two masses are of the same magnitude, so that the body will react equally to increases in the velocity of motion and the velocity of deviation. As a result only one concept of mass existed until K",9258

Just wondering if anyone else liked it. ; I liked it, I like indie movies, and I really got into it. I thought there was something wrong with Natalie's character though. I think that she was like experiencing some kind of psychological problems, but she was really funny at the same time. She is what Zach's character needed because he was so cold and shut out from the rest of society. His father being so objective of him, and him hurting his mother made him never forgive himself. He was experiencing psychological problems as well, so I think it helped having someone who could relate and not judge him. He never told anyone that he hurt his mother but her, not even any of his other friends. I am just glad that he found true love and came to terms with that it was not his fault that he was an ill child, and that his father stop making him feel worst by treating him like only a patient and not a son. I also liked how he went through all of the hassle he did to get his mother's jewelry back.

Italy is a member of the EU and I am shocked that such behavoir is allowed to continue. Whenever this matter is mentioned to higher authorities in the EU they simply say that police brutality in Italy is not within their remit. If the police in the UK acted the same way there would be hell to pay. Why is it not the same in Italy? ; In Genova, Italy 2001,the government of Silvio Berlusconi imposed a veritable police state on tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting against the meetings of the heads of state of the eight leading capitalist powers (the Group of 8). On July 20, carabinieri (paramilitary national police) charged into a peaceful demonstration and as protesters scattered, they shot an “anti-globalization” demonstrator, Carlo Giuliani, in the head, rolled over him twice with a jeep and drove away. It was an execution. \n\nThat night squads of riot police broke into the Diaz school which housed many protesters and the independent media center that was sending out news of the demonstrations. The blood-stained walls recorded the horrors that took place as scores of youth were brutally clubbed and hauled off to holding pens. As they were carrying out the attack, the cops repeatedly shouted “Viva Il Duce!” (Mussolini) and “Viva Pinochet!”",9283

To reject it is to deliberately embrace scientific ingorance and transmit such ignorance to our children.\n\nI believe among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator.\n\nI mean consider it. It's observation, hypothesis, and testing. That's what science is. It's not religion. Evolution is a fact. It's not a theory. An example is antibiotics. If we don't use antibiotics apropriately, bacteria become resistant. That's evolution, and evolution is a fact. To not acknowledge that is not ot acknowledge the world around you.\n\nBottom line: I completely accept and affirm the view of God as creator, but I accomadate evolution within that.\n\nYour thoughts? ; A belief in god and evolution is mainly a problem for closed-minded bible literalists...typically fundamentalists, who believe that every word in the bible is written as god intended.\n\nThe problem you face is this. If the bible isn't taken as a literal document of belief, how do you choose which bits to believe and which bits not to believe? So, is execution right or wrong...because the bible is both ""for"" and ""against"". Same for homosexuality (although not in modern terms).\n\nMost scientists I know who are christians accomodate this dilemma by using the bible as a broad belief framework - which is perfectly acceptable - and they talk about how they are able to draw their values from this position, but they keep an open mind about what science discovers and how science can help. \n\nBible literalists have a hard time trying to present their ideas without attacking science, as though science is some kind of enemy - the kind of enemy that will end up saving their lives from cancer or serious accident someday. The greatest disservice these people play in society is to present the idea to children that science is somehow seriously flawed and that nothing can ever be proven - unlike their belief system, however, which has a complete video record of god creating the earth in 6 days (sorry, that was sarcasm...something bible literalists will have a hard time understanding).\n\nTo Vangyblue below - that's the biggest pile of nonsense I've read for for at least 30 minutes.

Now that is priceless. Leave everyone to there own religion, just ask your questions, and let peace be with everyone. No matter who there God is, most here have genuine questions. ; It is true that Jehovah's Witnesses are not loved by everyone.\nhttp://jw-media.org/newsroom/human_rights.htm\nSome people hate Jehovah's Witnesses out of ignorance, or over some misunderstanding. A few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a Jehovah's Witness, and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire Christian religion.\n\nHowever, it seems that the majority of anti-Witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry. A few may even be motivated against their Christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things', Satan the Devil.\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:4) the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\n\nInterestingly, such ""hatred"" should be expected by true Christians in this time of the end, and it actually helps identify Jehovah's Witnesses as Christ's true disciples:\n\n(John 15:19) If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look!

2,"What causes enlarged tastebuds, and how do they form? ; I thought perhaps it was a matter of tongue damage and subsequent swelling, but it seems daft that if you burn or bite your tongue, only one bud would swell up. I've also dismissed the idea of it being hormonal, because if that were the case, teenagers would have a lot more of them, and post-menopausal women a lot less. So does anyone actually know what's up? ; A swollen taste bud can be caused by a number of things. Very hot food that burns and irritates a taste bud can cause swelling. Allergies to specific foods can also cause it. Taste buds that taste sweets are located on the tip of the tongue and salt taste buds are in the two side areas of the tongue tip. Sour taste buds are situated on the lateral sides of the tongue and bitter taste buds on the back. The area of the tongue where the swollen taste bud is located can be a sign of which taste is involved.\n\nA swollen taste bud can occur from continually eating spicy foods which constantly overstimulate these sense organs.

6,"What is Online Executive Search? ; I would also like to know what are Executive Search Services, Hospitality Executive Searches and\nHealth Care Executive Searches? All these terms with reference to the US. ; Executive search is the business of hiring professionals through a firm specializing in the process of identifying, screening and hiring for their client companies.  The term 'executive' is a bit of a euphemism, as many of the people placed through these firms aren't executives in the classic sense, but simply working at a professional level above that of administrative or clinical.  It would probably be much more informative if you simply Googled the phrase ""What is Executive Search"" and read some in-depth descriptions of the business.  Pay close attention to the differences between retained executive search and contingency executive search.\n\nHospitality Executive Searches and Healthcare Executive Searches are just that:  Searches for higher level talent within these two respective fields.\n\nIn case you're thinking of mass-mailing a resume to executive search firms hoping they'll save you the effort of conducting a proper job search--don't bother.  It's generally a complete waste of time unless you have a darn good background and already have significant experience within the field in which you're looking to advance.  I'm an executive recruiter professionally and have been so for the last 15 years.  I get countless unsolicited resumes and rarely spend more than 10 seconds with a resume.  The people I place are people whom I actively seek out, not people who are attempting to conduct a job search by passively spamming half the hemisphere with copies of a resume and waiting for their phone to ring.  Their phones rarely ever do.",9426

WHen the ball bounces back up it gains potential energy and kinetic energy.  In a perfect system with no friction, Pe + Ke at any given time would remain a constant number.  In reality, a little energy is lost due to friction.",9428

1,"How do we only see one side of the moon? ; I read somewhere that the moon rotates on its axis for 27 days, and revolves around the Earth for 27 days, too. However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

6,"On a bad debt unpaid(auto repo) can a collections agency or lawayer collect when it has been nearly 10 yrs. ? ; The wife of the husband was sold the vehicle and she had no job. The husband (now x-husand) for many years, he never paid the lst. paymnet.Eventually, it was repo. The dealer ship, collection agencies, now a lawyer has harrassed her for many years for the loss of resale. Can they collect or sue her for this balance?  Could she sue them for harrassement? She has a call from a lawyer's office regarding this which seemed odd. No registered mail has come.She has been a single mom for years and limited income. Please help us with this situation. ; Here are a couple thoughts.\n\nFirst, the FCC and FCRA (fair credit reporting act) both have something to say about harassing phone calls.  There are only certain times during the day when collection agencies and their affiliates are allowed to call a debtor.  Furthermore, they are not allowed to contact a debtor at work or on a cell phone (assuming that the debtor has dutifully informed them that the number is a cell or work number).  She can easily file a complaint with the FCC about the harassing behaviour if these companies aren't complying with the regulations.\n\nThis person needs to look up the statute of limitations for collecting a debt in her area (or for the area in which she lived when the contract was signed).  My understanding is that a business is legally entitled to try to collect on a debt forever and there isn't a statue of limitations.  However, if this person was married during the time or was under 18, she may be able to prove that it isn't her debt legally, allowing her to stop collection efforts.\n\nAlso, any type of communication that this person has with these agencies or their affiliates is voluntary unless she's been given legal notice.  That being the case, I recommend that she simply ignore them and they'll go away because it's just not worth their time to keep bothering you.  They'll write off the debt before too long.\n\nSuing the companies for harassment would just aggrivate the situation and cost her time and money which, presumably, she can't afford.\n\nFinal suggestion:\n- Contact a local consumer assistance hotline.  You might be able to find one by contacting your local PIRG (USPIRG site: http://www.uspirg.org/)\n- Obtain copies of her credit report from all three CRAs and determine if anything has been posted regarding this debt.  If applicable, follow the CRAs requirements for having the debt removed if it was reported.",9505

I am unhappy and I think he is too, although he want admit to it. ; Hi Cammy,\n\nIn my experiences I've found that a trial separation can be healthy sometimes in efforts to renew a marriage provided that both parties are in mutual agreement. Also, I've watched others go through this who have waited to do this when the relationship had degraded so much that each person left for the separation with intense animosities and in my opinion that will only make working things out all the more difficult. I've found that if two people are mature and recognize the need for 'space' during a relationship and don't wait until the arguing and fighting have begun to dominate the relationship then it's much easier to be apart and still genuinely want to work through the problems.\n\nBest of Luck!!",9516

Hailing too, I suppose :-) The advantage to that model is that it has all stainless parts (stainless does rust; take care of the gun) and the stock is glass-filled nylon which means it's less apt to torque the action out of true as the temperature changes.\n\nI have no particular opinions about any calibers, though.

1,"Tarzan's Mechanical Energy in a swing...? ; Tarzan, who weighs 688 N, swings from a cliff at the end of a convenient vine that is 18 m long. From the top of the cliff to the bottom of the swing, he descends by 3.2 m. The vine will break if the force on it exceeds 950 N. (a) Does the vine break? (b) If no, what is the greatest force on it during the swing? If yes, at what angle with the vertical does it break? Explain your answers, and show the equations used. Good Luck!!! ; When Tarzan jumps of the cliff his speed will increase, until he reaches the bottom of the swing, after which it will decrease. His speed leads to a centripetal force which adds to his weight. \nThe speed and therefore the extra force will be maximum at the bottom of the swing, when both are pointing in the same direction.\n\nFirst we calculate the speed at the bottom of the swing. We put \nm g h = (1/2) m v^2  and find v = sqrt ( 2 g h) = sqrt (2x9.813x3.2) = 7.92 m/s.\nThis speed adds a centripetal force of m v^2 /r to Tarzan's weight.\nF_centri = (688/9.813) 62.8 / 18 = 244 N.\nAdding  this to 688 N leads to 932 N. at the bottom of the swing.\nSo the vine doesn't brake.

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.

Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

2,"how can i gain wait????????????????????????????????????????? ; i am a 11 yr old girl, 5ft 1"" and i way 83 lbs. every one says i am 2 skinny \ni no i am but cant get fat i try to gain but very very tough ; Well, I have a bit of the same problem. Like you, I've been lean my whole life. If you feel you are underweight, try going to see a doctor who can check out your thyroid. You may have what I have, hyperthyroid. So we burn off energy faster than the normal person which is why we stay lean. However, to gain weight consists of certain factors. For one, people will tell you to try eating more. Instead, write down what you eat for about a week and then compare it to the food pyramid. Based on what you eat, it will tell you what food to eat more of to gain weight. For me, I realized I needed to eat more carbohydrates. Be careful if people tell you to eat a lot of protein. Everything must be done in moderation. Too much protein can have an effect on female hormonic changes as well as other things not so good. Also, start weight lifting. This will increase muscle as well as weight (What's called BMI; you can look it up online). I hope I've been of some help.",9593

1,"please help me with stoichiometry? ; 4 Fe(s) + 3 O2(g) ---> 2 Fe2O3(s)\n\n(a) What is the maximum mass of iron(III)oxide that can be obtained from 4086 g (9.000 lb) of iron? \n\n(b) What mass of O2 is required to oxidize the iron to iron (III) oxide? ; In order to do this, you need to realize what the balanced equation is really saying, and what relation that has to mass.  Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

5,"What is the longest home run ball ever hit?? ; Go Tigers!!! ; Their really isn't one correct answer to this question, I'll try to explain. I’ll start with the home run that Mickey Mantle hit at Griffith Stadium in Washington on April 17, 1953. The entire baseball world was led to believe the ball had traveled 565 feet from home plate to the point where it landed.\nIn truth, that figure derived from the distance from home plate to the place where a neighborhood child retrieved the ball. However, the actual distance in the air was probably about 510 feet (most sources still have this as #1). The same process happened again with Mantle on September 10, 1960 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit when a ball he hit was reported to have traveled 643 feet but it is readily apparent once again that the ball had bounced several times before it reached the estimated distance (this is the home run that the ""Guinness Book of Records"" has as #1). When your talking about tape measure home runs you can’t leave out Babe Ruth. It was said that Ruth once hit one 587 feet in an exhibition game against the Giants back in 1919. Also his tremendous blow to right-center field in Detroit on June 8, 1926, has often been reported as traveling 628 feet, but again was it measured where it first landed or where it came to a rest. Included among the other great exaggerations in the history of tape measure home runs are Dave Nicholson’s Comiskey Park rooftopper on May 6, 1964 who’s shot was calculated at 573 feet. The calculations were on the assumption that the ball traveled completely over the left-center-field roof. However, subsequent\ninvestigation indicated that the ball landed on the back of the roof before bouncing out into the night. Also, when Dave Kingman launched his wind-aided blow in Chicago’s Wrigley Field on April 14, 1976, ""The New York Times"" somehow concluded that it had flown 630 feet. It has been confirmed that the ball struck against the third house beyond Waveland Avenue, which is situated about 530 feet from home plate. Yet another claim (by the ""Guinness Book of Records""), has a minor league player by the name of Roy Edward ""Dizzy"" Carlyle having hit one 618 feet at Emeryville Ball Park, CA on July 4, 1929. Mark McGwire hit several home runs over 500 feet and one over 540 and his is measured accurately every time he hits one. I know I didn’t cover everything but I hope I covered enough to satisfy you.\n\nAlso, Mantle's home run off the facade at Yankee Stadium on May 22, 1963 traveled between 370 to 374 feet and was between 115 to 117 feet high. If it was still going up like some people claim it would have traveled an estimated distance of 620 feet if left unimpeded. However, the reality is that the ball was already on its way down, and those reporting the trajectory were victimized by a common optical illusion. It is a scientific fact that if Mantle, or anyone else, had sufficient strength to hit a ball that was still traveling upward when it met the towering facade, he would also have enough strength to clear that same facade by a distance of at least 100 feet. In order for the ball to be rising at roof level, it would have to have been traveling at a lower angle than that which produces maximum distance. If Mantle had provided the same power or velocity, but had launched the ball at a higher and more efficient angle, it would have passed out of Yankee Stadium at a height of over 200 feet! Mantle hit the facade on two or perhaps three occasions, but never cleared it.\nSource(s):\nYou can also go to:\n\nhttp://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/ar...",9694

I've been studying and teaching Shotokan Karate for over 20 years and I can tell ya that the ""side benefits"" are way more important than just being able to fight. \n   In my personal opinion, it is the self confidence I have gained through training that is the greatest thing to me. By this, I don't mean that I'm arrogant. I don't go around bragging about my ability, I don't go looking for fights, and I can't catch bullets with my teeth. What I mean is that if a situation does arise, I KNOW I can handle it. \n   You take on a different viewpoint when you know that you can really hurt someone...when you know that you could break bones, cripple or kill someone if you really had to. The question becomes ""Was what this guy did REALLY worth hurting him that badly? Does he REALLY deserve that?""\n   So, when some loudmouth ticks you off and insults you or your siginficant other, you have the self confidence to walk away. You know you could go hand him his butt on a silver platter, but you don't HAVE to just to prove a point to yourself. When some immature clown says, ""Hey, you take Karate...show me something!"" you know you don't have to get into a sparring match just to prove to them that you are good. \nYou get to that point when you don't feel you have anything else to prove to yourself, and you certainly don't have to prove anything to anyone else.

Then multiply this number by 2.57 and get the molecular mass of your compound (M(X)).\n\n2. Multipy M(X) separately by 0.6481, 0.136 and 0.2159 to get number of atomic weight units that are allocated to C, H, and O respectively. \nThen divide first number by 12, 2nd by 1 and 3rd by 16 to see how many atoms it amounts to.

Maybe...  \n\nLook at what happened to countries in Europe.  Most recently - Yugoslavia.  Quick history lesson for those that don't know, might bring a wierd, yet possible new perspective to this thing.  One that could happen.  Got me thinking anyway.  I would hate for something like this to happen:  I was in Kosovo during that whole war (and stuff leading up to it).  The whole deal was over ethnic Albanians that came to live and settle, then over-populate the southern area of Serbia (Yugoslavia).  Within 30-40 years, they completely re-populated the region (10 to 1 ratio of Albanians to Serbs), took jobs, changed the language, changed the religion, lowered living standards (dirty streets, neighborhoods, more crime).  Pissed off the Serbs something fierce!  Granted, what they did under SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC (that sick bastard) was disgusting, by deciding to ""ethnically cleanse"" the area - BUT it just goes to show how a MADMAN could rile up what the local people who were frustrated TRULY felt about being having their country essentially ""taken over.""  MILOSEVIC just played on their frustrations and nationalism to the Nth degree.  Then took the still somewhat communist style army and started whacking away at the Albanians in Kosovo.  It was pretty grim.  I'd hate to see our country ever delve into such dire territory.  YET IT IS NOT COMLETELY UNIMAGINABLE.

Yet we have to examine what we can handle in this country.  Our principles that our forefathers read as they came to the US fresh off the boats from Europe of ""Give us your poor, etc.."" should be held near and dear to us as principles, but REALITY needs to kkep us in check.  How much more can we afford right now?  ESPECIALLY when old G.W. is spending BAZILLIONS on the war!  We're sorta bankrupt right now.  We need to close the doors, lock 'em, fix up our own house, ask our friends that want to visit (prospective immigrants) to wait a little longer while we clean our house up for guests, then maybe let some more in.  We should let them in on an equal basis, too.  Right now we have WAY TOO FREAKIN MANY MEXICANS (and CENTRAL AMERCIANS are quickly climbing the ranks)  Where are the CANADIANS?  Seriously?  Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the country (and ballooned to that number in record time).  We need to balance the books as far as immigrants go.  How about from the EUROPEAN continent - any takers?  ASIA?  AUSTRALIA?  ANTARCTICA (I heard it's pretty cold there)?  SOUTH AMERICA?

1,"two physics questions, if you could help me step by step that'd be great since my teacher doesn't teach. ; 1) A clerk moves a box of cans down an aisle by pulling on a rope attached to the box. The clerk pulls with a force of 188 N at an angle of 25.0° with the horizontal. The box has a mass of 36.9 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between box and floor is 0.450. Find the acceleration of the box.\n\n2)A box of books weighing 259 N is shoved across the floor by a force of 435 N exerted downward at an angle of 35° below the horizontal. \n\n(a) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.57, how long does it take to move the box 9 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n(b) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.75, how long does it take to move the box 7 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n--what do the symbols even mean.... so yeah im really lost if u guys could explain how to do these probs so i know in the future, i'd appreciate it a lot. thanks ; 1) The angle of the rope needs to be considered to calculate horizontal and vertical components of the clerk's force. \nFh = 188*cos(25) = 170 N This is what pulls the box.\nFv = 188*sin(25) = 79.5 N This actually lifts the box slightly.\n\nThe symbol for coefficient of kinetic friction is µk. A lower number makes it easier to move the box - if you spilled some olive oil on the floor µk would perhaps go to 0.1. N is normal force. If this was on a slope, normal would be different from weight, but the floor here is level so N = W? \n\nActually no. Because the rope pulls up on the box slightly, the normal force pressing the box to the floor is less than the box's full weight. The box's weight = m*g = 36.9 kg*9.8 m/s^2 = 362 N. The vertical component of the tension in the rope relieves 79.5 N of that so N = 362 - 79.5 N = 282 N. \n\nSo Ff = .450*282 N = 127 N is the force that friction fights with. The horizontal portion of the clerk's pull is 170 N. So there is 43 N left over to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law says\nF = m*a\n43 N = 36.9 kg*a\nso a = 1.17 m/s^2\n\n2) Here the force is directed down at an angle so the vertical component of the force will add to the normal force used in calculating the friction.\nFh = 435 N*cos(35) = 356 N\nFv = 435 N*sin(35) = 250 N\n\nN = the weight of the box + Fv = 259 N + 250 N = 509 N\n\na) Ff = µk*N = .57* 509 N = 290 N This is not enough to hold the box stationary so 356 - 290 N = 66 N are available to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law again:\nBut first we need the box's mass. W = m*g\nm = W/g = 259/9.8 N = 26.4 kg. Now\nF = m*a\n66 N = 26.4 kg*a\na = 66/26.4 m/s^2 = 2.5 m/s^2\n\nThis is getting complicated. To move 9 m will take t seconds:\nx = (1/2)*a*t^2 Solve for t.\n\nb) Ff = µk*N = .75* 509 N = 381 N This is more than the horizontal portion of the clerk's push, so the box will resist. The answer is 0.",9800

0,"For those who believe in Jesus Christ.? ; If Jesus died for ALL your sins why do you still have to go to confession. ; Good question. \nLet me see if I can explain.\n\nOkay sin is all sin, but there are 2 ""kinds"" of sin. There is sin and then there are sins (plural).\n\nAll sin seperates us from God becasue God is perfect and he can't be with sin. So sin always blocks us from him.\n\nWhen we are born, we are born in sin, therefore sin is in our hearts. (To put it another way, we have a root of sin in us) That is why we need to be saved. When we accept Christ, he forgives us and that root (sin) is gone. We are completely forgiven, and we recieve access to God. That is what salvation is.\n\nHowever, even though we are forgiven and saved, we still mess up sometimes because we are human and we're not perfect. In other words, we commit sins. The sins we commit will not keep us out of heaven (becasue we have been saved)but they will keep us from God (because all sin does that). They get in the way of our faith and hinder our prayers. (For example have you ever messed up and felt guilty, then you were hesitant to pray because of the guilt?) Those sins will always get in our way, but as soon as we confess them to God, he forgives them and takes them away. Then the block is gone and he is free to continue moving in our lives. \n\nSo think of it this way, we are saved when we accept Christ, so we no longer have to worry about going to hell. But confession helps us to maintain a good relationship with our father.\n\nLook at it this way. If you have a child, you will love your child no matter what. Hopefully you would discipline your child, but you would never seriously harm them, and you would always protect them to the best of your ability. But if the child decided to rebel, run away from home, and ""live a life of sin,"" it would be harder for you to protect the child, and the child would get hurt along the way. On the other hand, if the child was obediant and respectful to you, it would be easier and the child would be better off (safer, better taken care of becuase you would have the ability to provide better in that case). But you would still love the child either way right. In the same way, God loves us no matter what we do, but as we confess our sins and obey him, we give him more ability to care for us better. If we run away and rebel, he still loves us, but we are on our own to sufer the consequenses that go with the sin we commit. So obviously the best thing for us is to confess and stay close to our father, so that we may recieve the full protection and benefits. (Plus from the parent perspective that's what He wants us to do becasue he wants to care for us closely.)\n\nOf course how you confess is between you and God. Ultimately God is the only one you have to answer to. However confessing to others (whom you trust) often does help becasue it helps us to ""walk in the light"" and avoid sin. I personally have never been to a formal confession, but I have benefited alot from accountibility partners and groups. In other words I have turned to trusted friends and confessed to them when I needed to. They in turn prayed for me and encouraged me, helping me get through things I needed to get through in life. I would definately suggest hooking up with a person or small group where you can do this.",9812

6,"I need ideas to help spread the word about my new home and office cleaning business.  Thanks!? ; Also, anyone who has a maid, how much do you pay them per hr? ; You can start by reading the article ""Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business"" at  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm. The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4.  Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business",9819

Anyways, here you go...\n\n\n Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter\n    Uploaded on Jun 3, 2005  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nEffects of Puritan Society in The Crucible and The Scarlet Letter \n\nEach society in the world is unique, and each has its own values and beliefs. Throughout time, societies have shaped the way that man lives. This includes not only his actions, but it also includes his thoughts and feelings. In many instances, such as in Puritan societies, religion plays the most important role. The Crucible by Arthur Miller and The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne are stories which vividly demonstrate the effect society has on people. The Puritan society that is created in each of these stories acts as the driving force to their plots. \nIn The Crucible, the entire plot is molded by the morals of the Puritan society. The superstition that many Puritans believed in is represented through Reverend Parris. He insists to Abigail that “if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Miller 10). Parris was not only concerned about the witches, but was terrified that his reputation will be ruined as well. This example also leads to another aspect of Puritan society that affected the plot. The Puritan people were very closely knit, meaning that everyone knew everyone else, and consequently, rumors spread quickly. This was why Reverend Parris needed to know “Who? Who? Their names, their names!” (Miller 44), so he could find someone to blame for the madness. The fear of witchcraft was so strong that even the decent Reverend John Hale, who was the most open minded of the characters, worried about its effect. He even had books in which there “…is all the invisible world, caught, defined, and calculated…the Devil stands stripped of all his brute disguises…we shall find him out if he has come among us…” (Miller 37). Another attitude of Puritan society that shapes this play is the fear of God. This fear is seen everywhere and it goes hand in hand with the idea of superstition. \nReverend Hale tells Tituba, “You are God’s instrument…face God- face God, Tituba, and God will protect you” (Miller 44), exhibiting the great trust that the people hold in God and how their actions are all in the name of him. This story would not exist without the God-fearing mindset of the Puritan people. John Proctor is no exception to this theme. He has a moral dilemma in which he states, “…I wilted, and, like a Christian, I confessed. Confessed!…Let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not!” (Miller 52). Even though he did not seem like the most religious man in the story, he remains loyal to his strong morals because of the society around him. The Puritan society in The Crucible was what let the story make sense. \nThe Scarlet Letter is another story that relies on the values of the Puritans and their society. The idea of harsh punishment for sins was the broadest of these values. Hester Prynne was punished with public humiliation and “with only that one ornament, -the scarlet letter,- which it was her doom to we",9830

8,"Why do men sometimes never call back or contact a woman again? ; I know a man that I had a magic moment with.

I have never felt such strong chemistry with another man.  We spoke, and he told me to contact him.  I did. But then I found out he was married. He never even responded to my e-mails or telephone calls. A friend told me that perhaps he thought it over, and did not want to trust himself to even be in my presence. Could this be a simple reason?  I assumed that if he was interested that something must be wrong with his marriage. He can't be happily married, do you think?\n\nI am not going bother this man again. I don't like being rejected. But I just have never had a man literally run to me, freeze in his steps, etc., etc., and just never respond.\n\nI just want to know what on earth makes a man behave like this in the first place? What should I do if I ever see him again? ; first things first, if this guy is married, then thats where the problem is. you know sometimes it happens with most men, they meet this lovely lady and they like her instantly. to tell you the truth, emotions and feelings would have overriden reason in this instance and you end up trying to hook up with that lady. some may end up doing the wort case scenario, that is having sex with that lady on the same day but some of them will just give or take contact details like this guy did to you. \n\nand then when they leave you, just because you are no longer there, reason start to dominate feelings and emotions once more and the guy would decide that the most reasonable thing to do will not to cheat on their partners or wifes so he will decide to not contact you anymore to avoid any future problems.\n\nbut i dont think that he has problems in his marriage, its only that he found you surprisingly beautiful and attractive and found you irresistable. so i advise you to just forget about this man and just pretend nothing happened",9842

0,"Has anyone had an experience with ghosts. I use to believe in them but I am not sure now.? ; There certainly have been a lot of sightings in the worlds. Any stories anyone? (real ones) ; I believe in ghostly events.  Having witnessed 5 events personally and watched my daughter holding a conversation with my mother after my mother had died.  As I have told of one of my experiences in a Wiltshire pub previously I will not re-tell that one, however I  will share these 2 with you.\n\nSome years ago, whilst working as a Security Supervisor at a Retail Outlet my colleague started out on his patrol.  As he wandered sown the mall he shouted back to me, ""look at the clock"".  The clock he was referring to was an old railway platform clock that had been restored and worked fine.  The hands on the clock were spinning furiously in different directions, they continued to do so for about 10 minutes then they stopped at the correct time and kept time for the remainder of the shift. (The whole thing was recorded on CCTV as we knew no-one would believe us).\n\nAt the same venue, I observed a man wearing a burgundy waistcoat walk into a children's playing area and towards some glass doors linking two of the malls. These doors were locked, the fire exits to the left of the doors were secured by plastic seals  and the only way back out would have been to return the same way as he had entered. Back through the children's playing area and along the concourse. Once again all the CCTV cameras in that area (there was 3) were pointing at this man who would be about 50-55 years old, quite a portly figure wearing a burgundy waistcoat and white shirt (please bear in mind that it was in the early hours of the morning and quite cold).  When my colleague went to investigate the man was no where to be seen. He checked the fire exits and all seals were intact, all the mall doors were locked. The only way that he could have gone was back through the playing area.  After the shift we pulled the CCTV tapes and you could follow this man's steps all the way up to the mall doors, where he goes out of sight behind a brick pillar, then moments later my colleague arrives at the location to find no-one there.\n\n(The outlet is a regenerated Railway building - could it have been an old station master?)\n\nThere will always be some people who do not believe - but I have seen too much to believe there is nothing after this life for us.",9844

2,"Is it possible that a thin person could be diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism? ; OK, so I'm not the most elidgible to have Hyperthyroidism. I'm only a teenager but I think I have it because of the chills. I'm getting a blood test done and as I'm scared that I have it, I'm also a little scared of not having it becacuse my mom doesn't believe me and I had to make a big deal about it so she would get me an apointment. She says the pediatrition will laugh at me and tell me teens don't get Hypothroidism and not even give me the test :( I think that the chills are a bit odd (twitching/jerking/shaking of my right shoulder, or arm/hand, face, and head shaking) but she says everybody gets chills, I just think I get a lot of them. The problem with my theory is that the main idea of Hypothyroidism is that it slows your metablism (as the thyroid's perpose is to release hormones that regulate the metabilism) and I'm not fat. I'm actualy below my recomended weight and the average for my age and height. Does this mean I have no chance of being diagnosed with Hypothoroidism? ; Ok, I'm a little confused by your question, do you think you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyriodism?  You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.  I get the two confused all the time but hyperthyroidism means your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone and hypothyroid means it makes not enough.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, a young thin person can have hypothyroidism.  I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

I need an option that doesn't require heavy parental activity, but can be done from home.\n\nThanks. ; Check out Keystone National High School at http://keystonehighschool.com.  My 16 year old son is homeschooled and takes courses through Keystone.  You can start courses any time and you have between 8 weeks (minimum) and a year (maximum, but you can apply for an extension) to complete them.\n\nFor $279-$379 (depending on if you do correspondence or online) per full-year course they provide you with the textbook, a study guide, and examinations.  You do six assignments per course (covering around 2-6 chapters each, depending on the length of the text), a mid-term, and a final exam.  All of the assignments and exams are open book.  This doesn't mean that they are easy or that it is a ""cheater"" method--they really make you work hard to earn good grades!\n\nThe courses can be completed with as much or as little parental involvement as desired.  You are able to contact your teachers so you don't need to have your parents teach you.  And because the exams are open book, they don't even have to administer the tests.  My son does most of the work on his own.  If he needs assistance he asks me or his girlfriend (he is behind 2 years in school because he was adopted from Russia where they start 1st grade at age 8, so she is 2 years ahead of him).  Because he is an English-as-a-second-language student, I review all of his essays before he sends them in to help out with grammar and spelling, but if your English skills are good, you don't need to have your parents do this.\n\nThe most important thing is that Keystone is ACCREDITED!  You get a REAL diploma from them, not a GED!  Future employers and colleges consider diplomas much better than GEDs and they are also more likely to consider a real diploma better than you just saying that you were homeschooled.\n\nAnother important thing is that you can just complete 10th grade if you want and then go back to regular school next year.  Most schools will accept Keystone's credits just like they would accept credits from any other transferring school.\n\nThe only commitment you need to make to Keystone at any given time is a single course--or you can officially enroll and take 5 courses, which is considered a full load.  My son takes 4 courses at a time, I know another student who takes them one at a time--spending all of her time on a single course over 8 weeks and then doing the next one during the next 8 weeks.\n\nGood luck!",9885

2,"What is Parkinson's Disese? ; What are some of the physical restrictions that develope? ; (m)\n\nParkinson's disease (paralysis agitans or PD) is a movement disorder often characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are due to excessive muscle contraction, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Parkinson's disease was first formally recognised and its symptoms documented in 1817 in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy by the British physician Dr James Parkinson; the associated biochemical changes in the brain of patients were identified in the 1960s.\n\nParkinson disease affects movement (motor symptoms). Typical other symptoms include disorders of mood, behavior, thinking, and sensation (non-motor symptoms). Individual patients' symptoms may be quite dissimilar; progression is also distinctly individual. There are four major dopamine pathways in the brain; the nigrostriatal pathway, referred to above, mediates movement and is the most conspicuously affected in early Parkinson's disease. The other pathways are the mesocortical, the mesolimbic, and the tuberoinfundibular. These pathways are associated with, respectively: volition and emotional responsiveness; desire, initiative, and reward; and sensory processes and maternal behavior. Reduction in dopamine along the non-striatal pathways is the likely explanation for much of the neuropsychiatric pathology associated with Parkinson's disease.",9909

6,"I have a lease purchase house and the potential buyers can't seem to pay on time.? ; I keep having problems getting them to pay and they often are late with payment.  I want to take the house back and get new buyers.  They have paid late every month and have told me that they feel like they probably won't be able to purchase the house and now want to change to a stright rental with a decreased payment.  What do you think? ; Actually, I think there are a few points to this question. First, what did YOU do to prequalify them to purchase the house in the first place?  Many LO landlords really don't care if the renter ever buys, they keep the LO money and either let the tennants go month to month, or let them move on.  So, assuming you want to sell the house, do a better job upfront of finding tennant buyers.  Pre qualify them.  1. Do they have all of the option consideration money upfront, with no payments (this means they have a lump sum or were able to save the money).  2. Does their current employment make it so they are able to make the payments on the house comfortably.  You can look at their income, and their outgo, and compare it like a lender does (that is what I do).  THey should not spend over 41% of their monthly income for, all items on the credit report, monthly payments, the principle and interest and taxes and insurance on the house. IF it is obvious they will be short...you probably want to look for the next buyer. But finally, if they will be renters until they exercise their option contract, do a smart upfront check on them as renters. First, do a criminal check on them, if they pass that, then look into the other items such as credit and references. If you find someone you like, then go to their neighborhood, drive it, and then call and ask if you can stop in.  If they are happy to let you come see them in their current home, you will get a feel for  how well they are going to take care of your property.  Due Diligence is important. Im not a lawyer, and if any of this info is wrong, it is simply my opinion.",9953

9,"How come the Government and nobody else has a problem with people flying the Confederate flag? ; I saw somebody flying one on their trailer when I took a camping trip into rural Ohio. This isn't even a southern thing anymore. ; The CSA flag is a flag foreign to most local jurisdictions.  Most towns, as municipal corporations, are incorporated like any corporation with the state in which they are in.  As such, the flags of any other state, the federal American flag and the CSA flag are all technically foreign to their own state and its' flag.  Depending on the specific wording of their codes, regulations, policies and ordinances, such prohibitions may act to prohibit much more than they might otherwise anticipate.  Remember, the CSA, just like the Ottoman Empire, the ancient Roman Empire, the Third Reich and the Soviet Union is equally foreign as it had its own system of government and state.",9957
