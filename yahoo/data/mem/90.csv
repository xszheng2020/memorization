5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13

9,"Can John Kerry keep his freaking mouth shut, a week before the election? ; I don't think his remark will hurt the democrats in the election, most people already have their minds made up.  But he is probably done with any future national office! ; I think he really screwed up here.  What he did is a career ender, no matter what party it came from.  Lets face it, the Republicans weren't/aren't doing much to help their standing, but thanks to Mr. Kerry (which he will remain, Mr. that is) they didn't need to.  Now they need to run with it.  \n\nAlso, this thing with Kerry refusing to appologize to the troops and the military, I guess he wants to take the express train out D.C.

The American People may not stand behind the leaders of the Military, but they do stand behind the troops.  After all, the troops are our Sons and Daughters.  Some of the smartest people in the nation work in and with the military.  By insulting the people who are defending our freedom, Kerry has doomed himself to an eternity of nothing.",49

5,"What are set-pieces in football? ; england manager Sven said that in the match against sweden,  they did not defend well against set pieces. what or who are set pieces? ; Football is a continuous flowing game i.e. the ball is always being kicked and moved around. However, there are situations when the ball is stopped and one player has time to kick it by himself (usually when there is a foul, offside or the ball crosses the line). Example: Free-kick, Corner-kick, Goal-kick, Throw-in etc. are types of set-pieces.",65

I went to the World Cup when the finals were at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.  Sat in the second row, 50 yard line.  It's been an up and down of emotions these past years.  The thing that impresses me the most is the competition of teams when they play.  Each country does not want to let their country down by losing so they play hard.  I hope Ronaldo gets to play the next game for Brazil.  What do you think of the USA's opening game this past Monday?  Yes, I will keep watching the World Cup.

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

What should have been a routine congressional decision was blown way out of proportion, but it is over. It is time to let it go. ; And to top it off, they were never going to manage the ports. They bought the company that runs the terminals in the ports, just like the Chinese Communists already own several now. Why was'nt there an uproar when that occured under Clinton?

9,"Currently, how long does it take for deportation to occur once an illegal is picked up? ; I'm just wondering because it seems like a real opportunity for illegals to just disappear if ""the system"" doesn't hold them in custody until a hearing.

Once a hearing does take place, how long before actual removal from USA takes place? ; We Shouldnt HAVE TO DEPORT ANYONE\n\nIf Congress were to pass a law that said, quite simply, that the CEO(ANY EMPLOYER) of any business that was caught employing ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS went to jail for a year - NO EXCEPTIONS - then within a month there would be ten million (more or less) people lined up at the Mexican border trying to get out of the United States And Back To Whatever Country They Came From. \n\nThey WILL NOT Stay If They Cannot Work\nNO Cost For Deportation\nAND They WONT Come Back\n\nIts TOO Easy\nThats Why It'll Never Happen",194

9,"Why Don't Some Americans Want a New 9/11 Investigation?(please read)? ; Based on the results of the 2006 election, the American people are finally asking for change. They don't like our involvement in Iraq. They voted out many members of the party that put us there. Perhaps they are also ready to question the events and decisions that put us there as well. Perhaps they are ready to ask what really happened on Sept. 11. \n\nForget the conspiracy theories for a minute and set aside the political gamesmanship. We are a country that spent five years and $100 million investigating President Clinton. We probed the depths of the Iran-Contra scandal – a debacle that would have never come fully into the public eye had a special investigator not been appointed.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission interviewed two of it's own members and spent only $3 million. We have spent far more energy, money and time seeking the leak of Valerie Plame's identity and Barry Bonds' use of steroids. ; I have screamed since 9/11 that we needed to look at those who gained from the attacks, just prior to the attack, the middle east was in chaos, Israel was in trouble with the UN and US public opinion was calling for sanctions in their attacking unarmed Palastinains, Bush was pushing for increased sanctions against Iraq, meanwhile bomb sniffing dogs were removed from the trade centers and security was cut back drastically.

9,"Why do we have so many voter Propositions in California (or any state for that matter) ? ; I consider myself a reasonably smart guy, and generally well read and up to speed on the political issues of the day.  But I do not think I should be deciding complicated legislation along with 30 million of my fellow Californians (I'm sure a few of which are not as well read as I).  I vote for a full-time legislator every two years -- in fact two at the state level (Assembly and Senate) --  who I expect will be my representative to research, draft, debate and vote on key issues important to me and others in my district.  Personally, I think the Proposition machine (that's really what it is her in Ca) is a cop out by our CA Legislature and an undue burden on an unengaged constituency (comparable to other points in our history). ; This is a representative democracy, a government ""of the people, by the people and for the people"" my friend.

It runs in my family, and it's embarassing to wear shirts because people ask if i'm pregnant WHEN I'M NOT. help i'm 13, 5'4 and 120 lbs. it's been puffy ever since i was born HELOP! ; I've had the same difficulty you have.  At the age of 29, I am able to embarass the asker by saying, ""no honey, it's just fat"" when they ask how many months pregnant I am...  But from my own experience at your age, I remember that they just won't believe you in school.  \n\nThe only things I can tell you follow the lines of your other answerers.  The crunches are a good start, and they can work well with other torso exercises.  (However, be sure you ""sit-up"" as you exhale or it can make the problem worse!)  The torso exercises are usually some form of exercise involving small weights (3lb or so, you don't want to bulk up!) and doing repetitive movements swinging from side/down to opposite side/up.  \n\nYou also might want to try walking, paired with arm swinging.  It looks strange, but if you have the bent elbows and actually move them consciously -- not just swinging by reflex -- it's supposed to help your torso get into shape.  There are also elastic stretch-bands that you can use to do leg exercises, and these will help tone as well.  \n\nOne other thing is the water suggestion.  You know the old health suggestion to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day?  Well, that's not caffeinated soda -- it's water!  Caffeine is a problem in this also.  Water will literally help to ""wash out"" your system, and initially it may help you to lose 5 lbs and its corresponding inches quickly.  It also keeps you hydrated and feeling like you have more energy, which will help you to become more active.  Moving around can help with that also.  \n\nLast, you are 13 and likely in your growth spurt stages now, and the abdomenal muscles will likely slim down as you grow.  Some of the ""pudgy"" people I knew in elementary and junior high school became the very slender people in high school!  At your age, it's never too early to begin exercising and drinking water -- but don't go to any extremes or begin starving yourself.  The exercise and water should help you now, and it will continue to be helpful all your life if you make it a regular habit.",474

9,"How should one with a libertarian viewpoint vote in the 2006 Congressional elections? ; On the one hand, the GOP has increased spending while expanding the Federal government's role in our private lives.

5,"Whats been the most exciting match of the 2006 Fifa World cup? ; What match do u think has been the most exciting so far in the world cup? ; GER-CRC, TUN-SDA, GER-POL, GHA-CZE, ARG-MEX, POR-NED, and GER-ARG were pretty exciting, as far as this tournament goes.  In terms of lots of chances, GER-POL and GHA-CZE are probably the best; in those games, Germany and Ghana really pressed forward and had exciting moments in front of goal, while Poland and the Czech Republic were able to get good counter-attacks against them, which was fun to watch.  GER-CRC had lots of goals, and was closer than the final score suggests.  TUN-SDA was just had a great second half, with a very late equalizer.  POR-NED was pretty exciting in part because it was a close game, but mainly because the referee made a spectacle of himself.  ARG-MEX and ARG-GER were exciting because they were close games that went to extra time and a shoot-out, respectively, but the quality of play wasnt the best as in some of the games.

Being surrounded by as much talent as he is hurts his money making ability as hes looked upon as ""just"" another cog in the Phoenix Suns machine , whereas Jordan was the ""main "" cog in the Chicago Bulls machine. Do you think the Bulls come even close if Pippen leads that team without Jordan? Ok now compare that to Phoenix where you have Steve Nash, Amare Stoudamire, Shawn Marion and even Boris Diaw. Don't get me wrong Phoenix would certainly miss Raja Bell if he left, but they'd still be considered a ""contending"" team  whereas Chicago without Jordan , in my mind at least ,wouldn't even be close to being a contender",608

That doesn't mean there aren't exploits for Firefox but most of them are harmless and will just cause Firefox to crash and all you have to do is clear the cache and restart Firefox, no harm done.

2,"Is it healthy to lose about 3 lbs a week? ; I'm trying to lose 37 lbs in 14 weeks and I would need to lose 2.8 lbs a week.  Is this healthy or too much?  I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963

Hematomas or contusions (or ""bumps"" and ""bruises"") develop when blood and scared tissue coagulates under the epidermis (top skin). \n\nHere is how to treat it:\n""For contusions (bruises), treatment consists of initially applying ice or cold packs a few times a day, to produce vasoconstriction (a reduction in arterial blood flow) which helps to decrease hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (swelling).\n\nIn general, the quicker you apply ice after the injury, the less bleeding will result.\n\nIf possible, elevate the bruised limb. Blood will leave the area of the wound and there may be less swelling. Resting the limb will also help to prevent further injury.\n\nIf the area is still painful after about 48 hours, apply gentle heat with warm towels, a hot water bottle, or a heating pad. The heat is applied for 20 minutes at a time to promote absorption and repair. Since heat causes swelling and increases tissue fluid, which may impair function, hot compresses may be followed by cold applications to minimize the secondary effects of heat.\n\nPressure in the form of an elastic adhesive bandage may be helpful to reduce hemorrhage and swelling. If infection should develop in the wound, the signs and symptoms might be increasingly severe pain, a fever of 101 degrees or more, swelling with surrounding redness, and pus. If any of these signs appear, your physician should be notified to make sure there are no additional problems.""",1180

The surgery consists of a plastic screw being inserted into the shoulder, the tendon is then weaved into another piece of flat plastic that is then attached to the screw to hold the tendon into place.  The recuperation time is around 6 months and you'll need physical therapy during that time.  It takes along time to heal because there's no way to actually reattach the tendon permanently.

9,"A trial period for a President? ; After the president has been in office for a year should we be able to vote on whether to or not to keep them? ; No. It sounds like a good idea given the nature of certain presidents elected in the past, but this would be way too complicated.  It's likely  registered voters of the opposing party would mostly vote against the incumbent, meaning the incumbent would need to spend his entire first year in office campaigning to protect himself against being voted out.  If this were the case, the President would have no track record to go on.  It would cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars more in campaign funds that could go to better use, and would distract the executive branch, the media, and the general public from focusing on real issues.  \n\nThe ultimate solution to this is for voters to do some more research before they vote.  Look at track records, look at the candidate's real stance on the issues, and resist being spun by the propaganda machines that dictate campaigns.  That's probably unlikely to happen though.",1314

3,"If you asked to write asucessful essay about &#92;ascool to give the students the skillsand knowwledges needed ; elements can include , but are not limited to iportant physical chracteristics of the school ; Well first, you need to be sure your grammar and spelling are impeccable so people will take you seriously. Second your question is a fragment and does not make much sense. I think you are asking what skills and knowledge should be included in a school to make it successful? If that is the case there are hundreds of possible answers. My opinion on this matter is not always liked but it would be effective. Here is what I think (you best be careful with stealing ideas though as much of this is written in a paper I did). First, you need a sound building in which to house your school so the kids will be safe, secure, and have an environment conducive to learning. You also need to be sure the building is located in an area that will serve the students you wish to serve.\nSecond, you need a well developed curricular objective. What is the purpose of your school? Vision statement? Goals? Objectives? among other questions. You also need to define what your school is. Is it a private school or a public school or something in the middle? \nSkills wise I believe we need to concentrate on the basics FIRST. Reading, Writing, Math, Science, and Social Studies are the most important subjects. Depending on the focus of your school will depend on which are the most important. The federal government would argue with you that Reading and Math are most important but I do not believe you place one core subject above another. I also believe schools do not do enough with teaching students to WRITE a good sentence, paragraph, essay, or paper. \nOther than those basic assumptions of a school it comes down to the focus of your educational mission. If your school is a high school geared toward technology then you should be providing students with skills in the fields of technology. If your school is a middle school that is to prepare students to get into a particular high school then you should tailor your program towards the requirements of that school. If you are a college prep school then you need to immerse your students in college prep classes to build the skills necessary for college study. This could go on forever!\n\nStart with a mission plan, goal, and objectives to establish your educational mission. Then the rest will flow off of that thought.\n\nhope that helps....",1398

Sitting back to defend just wasn't in their vocabulary, and in the build up to the world cup they swept all aside with some breath taking displays.\n\nThey started the world cup finals well too. They comfortably qualified top of their group, to enter a second group stage. They were unfortunate though, because in the second group stage they did not face weaker teams, as the draw had been designed to produce, but defending champions Argentina and Italy, both of whom had started slowly in the competition. However, they beat Argentina 3-1, and only needed a draw to progress to the next round against Italy.\n\nItaly started well, and scored an early goal, but Brazil piled on the pressure and brought the game back to 1-1. At this point, they only had to close up shop and see the game out - but that wasn't their mentality. They carried on attacking, and left themselves venerable at the back. The Italians scored again, and led until 20 minutes from the end, when Brazils attacking play finally made it 2-2.\n\nAnother defensive mistake was to blame for the third Italian goal, and thanks to some heroics from the Italian keeper Zoff, the game finished 3-2.\n\nBrazil had been knocked out, but had played some superb football and had, perhaps, reminded people across the world how football could be played.\n\nFor this reason there 1982 team will always be remembered as one of the greatest teams of all time.",1506

That is, in order for the universe to behave in the manner that it is, there should be enough matter to generate the proper amount of gravity, but we can only see about a third(?) of the amount of matter required.

1,"Will the spin of galaxies ever stop? ; Do the laws of physics postulate that the spinning of galaxies/planets/moons will eventually slow to a stop or is it infinitely perpetual? (Bare with me. I have no physics education) ; carljoseph has the correct answer.  The galaxies have no reason to stop spinning any more than the planets have a reason to stop orbiting the sun.  (Eric p, I don't know why you think the law of perpetual motion does not apply to circular motion.)  There is no continuous force that *keeps* them in motion ... it's just momentum from the process that formed the  galaxies (or the solar systems), and there is no counter-force (like air resistance) slowing them down.  Now it's possible that there is infinitessimal resistance due to space dust, but there's nothing in the laws of physics that says that a rotating object (like a galaxy or a solar system) must eventually stop rotating.  So they will continue to turn indefinitely.\n\nNow, some of these stars will explode at some times in their lifespan, and may or may not leave behind the burned out shells (mostly iron, the most stable atomic nucleus there is) of dead stars and planets, but the galaxies will continue to spin as long as there are stars (or star remnants) in them.",1834

Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

5,"WHAT will Ivan Basso bring to the Discovery Channel Team? ; He has signed with them ; Awesome news!\n\n  I was unaware of this, so thanks for the good news.\nIvan is a great cyclist, with a great attitude and one of the best mountain climbers in the world (easily in the top 5).\nI think Basso is a much better fit with the Discovery Team then with his old CSC team. \n\nI'm also a big fan of Tyler Hamilton, who was suspended, due to doping (wrongly) accusations two years ago. Tyler has a very similar riding style, when compared with Ivan Basso.\n\nRemember all of the past TDFs where Lance Armstrong and Hamilton where always side by side on the mountain. stages? I don't know if Ivan would be able to endure the pain that Tyler did in the 2003 TDF, where at the end of stage 1, he was involved in a 35 rider accident where he broke his collar-bone in two places. He continued on to win the 17th stage and finish the Tour in 4th place overall.\n\nSo, as far as Discovery Team taking on Tyler's 28 year old, Ex-CSC teammate, Ivan Basso?  It should be an awesome move for everyone involved. \n\nI could easily see Ivan taking the Discovery team back to the Yellow, hopefully restoring the world's confidence in an American team once again.\n\nI can hardly wait!\n\nResponse to Ross:\n\n   By the way Ross, watch that stage again!  Ivan never beat Lance! That mountain stage win was a courtesy win given as a gift to Basso from Armstrong. Lance has a lot of respect for Basso and considered him to be a rider that could one day take his place. Watch the tour footage and you'll see Lance wave Basso on before reaching the finish. Lance gave up several yellow jerseys to other riders that he felt deserved it, as long as he had the overall lead, that was all that matterd to Lance.\n\nResponse to Doping Accusations by the (angry) Europeans:\n\nI myself, have never touched a drug in my life, yet years ago I tested positive twice, by the sport I was involved in. I retested again and was found innocent on both accounts.\n\nThan again when I was 17, I failed a polygraph that I was completely truthful on. I didn't get the job I was applying for, but I learned an important life lesson, not all test are fair and without fault.\n\nAs far as Floyd Landis, I can't be sure one way or the other. I hope that Landis is innocent, but that jury is still out for now.\n\nAs far as Tyler Hamilton, I without a doubt believe that he was wrongfully accused and hopefully he will soon be vindicated.\n\nEuropeans: Get over it! The Americans are here, they're viable contenters and they're here to stay. So shut up, get in that saddle and ride.",2208

Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice.

Everyone who is mad at him needs to realize THEY aren't perfect either! Yinz are pissin me off!!! The only thing we should be worrying about is that Ben gets better so he can go on living a long happy life.\nGO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!! ; Most of the people who are calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet have been calling him dumb for not wearing a helmet for a year now. Ever since it became well known that he does it without wearing a helmet people have been saying he was an idiot for it. They aren't calling him an idiot as a general thing, it is calling him an idiot for making a stupid decision. Yes he is 100% within the law. That doesn't mean people don't think the law is stupid. Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head. Remember depending on the helmet they don't really go down enough to prevent a jaw from being broken.\n\nTo old school Yinz is Pittsburghese although most use yunz.\nAs to the one who commented about it being against his contract, sorry but you are mistaken.

Is there a way to make it so My new hard drive is my primary one or would i have to go inside and change that. or is there a way to clear my C: drive now that i have all that same info on my I: drive.? ; okay, so you put the new hard drive in your computer and saved all the files to it that's cool, but don't ever delete any program files.  What probably takes up most of the space is music or videos.  So make sure you saved them to the new hard drive then just delete them off the old.  Your operating system is on your C: drive so you can't change the new one to your primary drive.  I would go through the files on the old one save what you want to and then delete them.

1,"Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ; Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ones? \n\na)They had more volcanic eruptions in the past, which released their internal heat. \nb)They were cooler when they formed. \nc)They have relatively fewer radioactive elements. \nd)The smaller ones are farther from the Sun. \ne)They have relatively more surface area compared to their volumes. ; Of your choices, (e) is the best.  (a) is no good because it fails to account for the continuing generation of heat, as, for example, by the earth.  (b) is no good because they were all about the same temperature when they formed.  As the protoplanets grew larger, their interiors began to heat up.  (c) is no good because what matters more is density, and there's no reason to believe there are significant differences in the density of radioactive elements.  (d) is just plain false: Earth is farther from the sun than Mercury.\n\nThat leaves (e).  Surface area of a sphere is 4pr^2, where p is pi, and volume is (4/3) pr^3, so the ratio of surface area to volume varies as 1/r ... it varies inversely with radius, so the ratio for smaller planets is greater than that for larger ones.\n\nThe key connection, though, is internal <pressure>, which is a direct function of r.  Larger planets have more pressure at their centers, and that means more heat.  In fact, if the ""planet"" were big enough, it would become a star.\n\nConclusion:  Big means hot.",2680

6,"Financial institution or not?  When to dump? ; I've been managing my money for quite some time and have done very well.  I realized that I may not be making wise choices with mutual funds and gave $80K to Fidelity to manage while I manage the rest of my accounts with Fidelity.  This was 4 months ago.  My rollover has since lost 10k.  Is it time to dump or is this the stock market?  None of my other investments have lost this much.  This is 10 grand in 4 months...   I'm ready to call them and say ""we're done, I'll do it"" but I'm not sure if they've changed my funds to give me a better turnover whereas I've left my money in my other funds for years.  Am I missing something? ; With respect to the market in general, there's been a good-sized pullback from May to the current period.  Those stocks which have suffered most are the ones which have had the largest amount of growth (precious metals, emerging markets, etc.).  Many funds not only lost all of their gains Jan-Apr, but many actually dipped into negative YTD territory.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: is this money you have in Fidelity on a permanent downward trend or an overdue correction?  Are your losses due to the possibility that your investments at Fidelity were focused on the highest growth (and therefore most volatile and overdue for correction) funds?  What are the long-term performance records of the funds you've chosen (4 months is a drop in the bucket of time)?\n\nBasically, you can't just look at gains and losses.  You have to look specifically at the funds you've chosen, and balance them against your personal risk tolerance.  It's very likely that with the right (or wrong) combination of funds, you could have lost as much with T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Bridgeway or any number of fund families.  If you don't believe me, look at their Websites and check the fund performances.  Red ink all over the place.\n\nDon't dump funds just because they're going down or buy them just because they're going up.  How do you know you're not buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  You'll inevitably wind up buying high and selling low.  Understand why you're buying into a fund and if the circumstances that made you buy them still make sense, stick with them.  If circumstances have changed, that's the time to re-evaluate and think about selling.  Also think about selling if the assumptions you made originally were wrong.",2688

When I reboot PC, the boot up sequence will not complete. It keeps auto rebooting, shutting down, initialising then shutdown again by itself. I tried formatting the hard disk but then it cannot complete reading the whole recovery disk since while reading, it automatically shuts down and restarts without completing the whole boot-up sequence. I also tried reloading original configuration in the set-up mode but to no avail. No error would appear whatsoever, a clicking sound is heard to suggest that the computer has been powered-on then shutdown (no power) and then clicking sound to suggest it is again powering up. Sometimes if lucky enough, longer powering up even reaches to display the start-up screen but sometimes is too short that clicks on and off in short durations. This is like booting and rebooting done automatically by the computer. Is this a case of hardware problem and part has most probably been damaged? This is perfectly working before but not until now no new software/hardware was installed whatsoever. Please advise. ; There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors.",2780

This said, once we do, we are usually in Peace.\n\nSecond - Not all religion promote self understanding and inner Peace. Some have very specific instructions as to what to do in certain cicrumstances when one is faced with people from other beleifs. This means that if there are radically and very picky and emotially hurt people, they can apply those aspects of their scriptures and try to make them real.\n\nThird - Most all religions sees their books as a guidance and God graces passes through it. Islam's Koran is seen as the word of Allah, thus making it difficult to say that radical Islamist muslims are not following their book\n\nFourth - Many evangelical groups also focus on the Old Testament and apply intolerant and less compassionate aspects of God. In my book Jesus came to toss that understanding of God aside, but that is another subject.\n\nFifth - The Sikhs also have a sacred book and it is seen a their Guru. However, that book is treated and respected in temples...\n\nI beleive that learning how to communicate tames physical violence and brings a better way to find common grounds to share. Why we are having so much issues is when we blob religions together thinking that they give the same message of Peace. This illusion is not helping currently and creates insecurity, misunderstandings (such as the Cartoons incident) and bigger chasm. Many people really adhere to their religion and feel threathen when it is placed as something equal to other beleifs such as science, secularism, ideological and philosophical contributions to society.\n\nSo, no, religions absolutly do not have the same basis and even Goals.",3039

5,"Mortorcycles and the NFL? ; Do you think that after what happened to Pittsberg QB Ben Roethlisberger, The NFL will start putting in the players contracts banning motorcycle riding? Do you think it is right of the NFL to do that? ; here are my vview on things:\nI'm reading through some of the comments about this situation ""I hope it's not serious"", ""gee that's too bad, we hope he'll be all right""...""he's a great player, hope he can still play""... but I can't help thinking ""what a waste.""\n\nHow many of us would love to be living a dream, to be a pro football player, making millions? This kid is already on record as the youngest QB ever to win a Superbowl, he's got his whole life and career in front of him, and he doesn't care to protect all that he has to live for?\n\nOne article I read mentions how players past and present, as well as his coach have appealed to him to reconsider his celebration of freedom in not having to wear a helmet. Fellow Americans presumably equally in support of ""freedom"" yet were also able to consider what he potentially had to lose if he should meet in an accident.\n\nAnd here we are. The article I read said ""injuries do not appear life-threatening."" Will he play again? Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye. He refuses to wear facial protection, and he's out for the first month. Duh.\n\nLike everyone else in the sports world, I join in wishing Big Ben a full recovery. I hope we get to see him continue what many are now confident must be a hall of fame career. Do I feel sorry for him? Sure...but, for crying out loud, at what point do we hold people accountable for taking unnecessary risks? Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street? If we expect kids to make smarter decisions in the interest of their own safety, why is it so easy to make excuses for ""adults""?",3085
2,"Weight isssue?!? ; I am 16, since the start of the year i have gained alot of weight. In Jan i was 123lbs now i am 181lbs and i am 5'6. I was concidered attractive before, am i still attractive now or what if i became 200lbs? The reason why i have gained is because i seem to of just become addicted to food, no emotional problems.

It will spell it out for you.\n\nI don't think you can say that you are addicted to food, and that you have no emotional problems in the same sentence.  If you want to lose weight, exercise and diet are the keys.  There's no quick fix.  If you keep eating like you are, you will keep gaining, pure and simple.\n\nIf you want to lose wight: Instead of 3 meals a day, eat 6 SMALL meals. Drop your carb and fat intake, as it is obviously too high. Cut out ALL sweets... no more deserts. Treat fast food like the plague that it is... in other words, don't do it! Drink LOTS of water, drink NO sodas. Up your activity level and get on an exercise program 5 days a week. You may not want to exercise now, but after a week of it you will find it addictive and you will have no trouble maintaining it. \n\nYou either need to change your entire life style, or forget it.

I want to lose 10 lbs very quickly, what else do I need to do? ; You need to have high intensity and increase sessions to 1.5 hours here is a plan I follow. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit.  \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.",3254

I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

6,"My mutual fund has been profitable.  Should I cash in just before or after distribution day? When is best? ; Stock market looks overbought to me.  My mutual fund has done well.  Distribution will be completed December 22, but should I sell before or after?  When is best time? ; If you are cashing out, then it would not make a difference if you sell before or after the distrubtion date. However, if you can wait till next year you can differ your capital gains tax.\n\nIf you are putting money into the fund then it is best to invest after the distrubtion date. Typically when a fund pays out (dividends & cap gains) the NAV (Price) drops; however, the number of shares you own increases if you selected for dividend/cap gain reinvestment. In other words,  your total account value will remain unchanged. However, the capital gain distrubtions may be taxable (If not in an IRA), and therefore, it is best to differ your taxes to next year (Assuming that you are in the same tax bracket next year)",4878

5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.  Many people thought they'd fall apart once they lost Mulder and Hudson, but they keep contending.",5172

Fresh vegetables and fruit should be eaten before evening so not to firment in the stomach and if possible no heavy meats in the evening and if you can you last meal should be before 6 or 7 p.

1,"Can light rays bounce off other light rays? ; I am trying to find out if a light ray (or laser beam) can bounce off another light ray. If so, how it is done? ; No Way Man!  Photon-photon scattering?  Highly dubious.  Photons don't have charge. They don't self-interact, that's why the electro-weak theory works so well... right?\n\nResponse to Dr. Bob's response:\n\nI agree that this process occurs (although a photon that decays into a e+e- pair has to be close to another mass so momentum can be transfered; isolated photons cant decay into e+e-).  But in such a case, would you really say that ""one light ray has bounced off another?"" I'd say that it was ""bouncing"" off the electron/positron pairs.  Just semantics I suppose.",5889

As both houses have to pass the same version of the same legislation it goes into committee of members of both house's who try to work out a compromise bill.  This is usually where all sorts of things get added to the bill that may have nothing to do with the bill in order to get both sides to agree on the bill.  At this point it goes before both houses again to be passed, if both houses pass the same version of the same bill it goes on to the President, however if any changes have been made between the two houses it goes to committee again.  This is how many pet project's or as it is called Pork Barrel Spending is created.  It is the same thing as the President spoke of as Earmarking in his State of the Union Address.

9,"Why is there no talk by the newly elected Democrats to reopen a 9/11 investigation? ; There are so may questions surrounding the official 9/11 story that I wonder why the newly elected Democrats are not promising to reopen the investigation. From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement.

5,"why don't rugby players sustain injuries like footballers.? ; In the world cup the game is stopped every ten minutes due to somebody rolling around in agony on the ground,but in Rugby, \nplayers have broken noses and teeth missing but rarely do you see a match stopped. ; Football by the very nature of the game concentrates mainly on the feet - with the speed and standard of football increased the tackles and contact to the lower part of the body will be quite hard & frequent. With rugby on the other hand most of the contact will be experienced in the upper body - the training builds up the upper body to take the hits. Probably since there is more 'flesh' (muscle & bulk) on the upper body the degree & frequency of contact that can be sustained would be greater than around the ankles & shins. \nThe rolling around bit by the footbal players is probably due to the fact that in todays football/soccer games it is that hard to score a goal due to the high level of skill, any advantage gained will be a bonus.\nWith rugby union now being a fully professional sport, increased speed & fitness combined with the large number of games being played I think injuries will be more common place. What you will notice is that due to the reasons just mentioned before, the retirement age of the rugby players will decrease, remember Paul Rendel 'The Judge' played international rugby for England in the 1980's at the age of 36 - it will be unlikely that players will represent their country at an international level at such an age in future.",6526

0,"Bored = Afraid of Hindus or Buddhists? ; I dont fear any people of faith.  Spirituality, like someone said is entirely different.  Spiritual people's beliefs, from what ive encountered, are overwhelmingly positive and personal, as opposed to half positive, sometimes disgustingly negative.  Buddhists i think have far more sensible and positive beliefs than christians, i think eastern 'religions' are intriguing and to be learned from.  I cant say that i dont like all christians, i dont know them all, i dont like what they believe.  Dont pray for me, instead smoke a blunt for me, at least do something that accomplishes something.  If anyone cares, my belief system is very simple;  if there is a god, he will not punish me or anyone else for that matter in any way.  Beyond that big IF, i believe that i dont know, and i wont pretend to.  But i will constantly question, and never accept blindly the assertions of people who know just as little as i do.  Religion WISHES to impose its VERY conservative positions into everyones life. ; For thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry. God is not like a father in a patriarchal society, who has His favorite children to whom He communicates. This idea seems rather archaic and crude. Hinduism believes in behavior than belief and  experience over authority. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, Prophetic religion is severe, militant, uncompromising, intolerant, while mystic religions are renouncing, and peaceful. \n\nThere is no need to be afraid of world's most tolerant, religion wich never persecuted nor attcked any country in name of religion .\n\nBored?? The vast collection of Hidu philosophy is fascinating and colourfull. No one can ever be bored . \n\nIn fact it will improve your understanding of mysticism even in christianity.It is a collection of wisdom of innemerable sages are missing out a great deal.\n\nThe Hindu religious system can be divided into two major systems. The Orthodox system (called astika in Sanskrit) accepts the authority of the Vedas.\n\n1. Sankhya - founder Sage Kapila\n2. Yoga  -  Sage Patanjali\n3. Mimamsa  - Sage Vyasa / Sage Jaimini\n4. Vedanta  - Shankaracharya, Ramanuja/Chaitanya/ Madhava/Vallabha\n5. Nyaya  - Sage Gautama (not Buddha)\n6. Vaisheshika - Sage Kanda\n\nThe Heterdox (Nastika) system rejects the authority of the Vedas. This system includes Carvaka (materialism), Jainism, and Buddhism. The Carvaka system denies existence of the individual self(atman) apart from the body and rejects the notion of moksha (salvation) for the atman\n\nWisdom of Geeta is a class apart.\n\nHinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of worship. When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. For it is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. Thus, it becomes a kind of social idolatry. Highly individualistic, Hindus have always resisted any regimentation of thought.\n\nRegarding mothermulesmeals' post:\n\n I am glad I am not one of her friends at whom she is  always preaching Jesus  !!!

5,"Should Barry Bonds be allowed to keep playing baseball? ; With all the signs that he has used steriods, why is he allowed to keep playing and chasing Babe Ruth's and Henry Aaron""s records. And don't play the rascist cards. Aaron was a true gentleman, Ruth was flambouyant but also a good man. and neither used steroids. Bonds is a jerk to fans and has the same condesending attitude that many current day atheletes have. ; Absolutely. Baseball has never proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that Bonds has knowingly taken any performance-enhancing drugs. Yes, most signs point to the fact that he has, but he has never failed a drug test.\n\nUnfortunately for the sport and for the fans, baseball and the players association didn't implement a careful, thorough drug testing and penalty process until very recently. So lots of records over the past decade or so that may or may not be tainted with drug use will always have an implied asterisk next to them.\n\nAlso, the truth is that cheating has been a part of the game since the beginning. Corked bats, scuffed balls, amphetamine use, etc. have always been around and fans and baseball have looked the other way.",6743

Exercising WHILE you have the cramps only makes them worse-- trust me, I had that problem when I was 18 (at first the doc thought it might be a cyst, but then I just started working out all the time because of a school activity, and I am 21 now, still work out regularly, haven't had them since).  And you said cheaply-- exercise is free!\n\nBut speaking of cysts, it could be one of those.  My friend's sister had killer cramps, and it turned out that a cyst was the reason.  You might want to go to your gyno and ask, especially if the cramps are so bad that you cannot function, or that you have trouble standing up.\n\nOr try Motrin or Midol or something, but if those don't work, seriously, see the doc!",6767

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

Help, plz (& the prom is just around the corner...although I'm not sure if I'm going)!!!!!! ; There are none--side effects can be worse than the pill itself.  Learn to change your lifestyle and you'll be happier in the end and will end up not gaining the weight back from Drastic dieting or pills.  Once you start eating better and doing something for exercise the weight will come off --those that have more to lose will see a results faster than those that have only 5-10 lbs to lose.  For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.  No sugar, white bread, rice, fast food, processed foods, etc.  Spread them out between 6 meals a day, every 2.5 hours, this means every meal will have to be 430 calories, not bad when you break it up.

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part. Hmmm. Seems to be missing from the site you posted as well.\n\nFirst, if trying to construct an argument, you may want to pull facts from something other than a conservative spin house.

When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this.

4,"LINUX Distrubution? ; What are the rules or laws for distributing open source applications such as Linux?  I noticed several websites that sell Linux on CD if you don't want to download the application. Do these companies have partnerships or can anyone do this? ; There are a few open source licenses, the two most common are the GNU and BSD.\n\nGNU essentially states the software has to be totally free and you have to share the source code.  Anyone can do anything they want to it as long as they share the source code.  The only expection is that you cannot sell it for a profit.  The places selling linux are not charging for linux, but charging for the medium it comes on and shipping.  If you buy it in store, you are paying for the book, packaging, medium and usually a few months of support.\n\nBSD is a little different, you are free to do what you want with it.  Anyone can take and use the source code and do anything they want with, this includes packaging the code in a software package and selling it.  You also do not have to release the source code.  Two great examples, Windows and OS X.  Windows uses a lot of BSD code for it kernel and OS X uses a ton of BSD code, as the core and more are essentially BSD.  \n\nPersonally, I think the BSD license is crap.  Companies like Microsoft and Apple are taking it, using it, selling it and giving back next to nothing to the community that they wouldn't be where they are with out.",7928
4,"Internet Explorer 7 Windows/Tabs? ; with the new ie 7, featured is the tabs that allow you to have multiple web sites open at once.  What i was wondering is: Is it possible to take one of the tabs and make an entirely new window with it, or would you have to just open another ie and then go to the web site again?  I know that completely defeats the point of the tabbed browsing, but I wanted to know. ; I'm not totally sure of what you're asking, but I'll give it a go.   We have IE7.  You open IE and your home page, for instance Yahoo, comes up immediately.  If you ""pinned open"" your Favorites list, that also comes up immediately. (Like IE6, you can either have Fav open or closed).\n\nAt this point, the tab in which Yahoo came up is not fixed.  Now, suppose you want to open Yahoo Answers, you can either (1) click on Answers and it replaces the home page in the same tab (so, at this point there is just one tab open, so it's akin to being on IE6 at this point), or (2) you can hold CTRL and then click Answers, which will open a new tab for Answers, or (3) you can click on a blue arrow next to Answers if in your Favorites, which will also open a new tab for Answers.  At this point, there is one tab open with the Yahoo home page and one tab open to Answers. \n\nYou can click and search around under the Yahoo tab without affecting the Answers tab, and vice versa.  It's essentially like having two IE's open at the same time, like you have to do in IE6.  Only it's much faster and once you get the hang of it, much much easier to get around.  For instance, you can be looking at something on a multiple page site and tab it for future viewing (it'll be in it's own tab), yet continue your browsing through that site.  You don't have to back-peddle through multiple pages to find it.  It's a thing of beauty!",7931

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

But most real-world reactions aren't like that.  The reaction rate tends to slow down as product is created.  If one used just the right amounts of reactants to produce the theoretically possible amount of product, one might wait a very long time, or forever: many reactions just reach an equilibrium, and never go to completion.

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602

4,"What is the safest way to backup your digital photos ? ; Should I use DVD-R, external harddrives ... what will secure my photos 20 years from now when I want to look at photos of my kids growing up ? ; Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Hard drives have a MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) bascially this means that they will fail within a certain time or at least produce bad sectors making some of your data unrecoverable(ish). One way to try to protect data on your PC is to have a RAIDED system that means 2 or more identical drives and hardware or software replicates the software across each drive so if one drive goes down you still have your data. This does not help if the PC goes on fire or gets water damaged, you should always have a seperate backup procedure.\n\n2. DVD's are a good way of backing up your data and I would say are a more reliable way of backing up rather than Hard disks but they are limited to 4.7GB (single sided). What I do is burn a backup every week or whenever I do a big change of data but this is dependant on the old saying ""What happens if your Hard Disk died in 5 minutes would you miss any data on it"" if yes do a daily Backup. 99% of IT companies only backup there data every day so backing up every few hours is a bit extreme but again if it is critical do a backup. Buy quality DVD's!\n\n3. USB memory sticks are pretty tough bits of kit and you can give them quite a bit of grief before they fail, USB sticks use memory chips rather than magnetic media like hard disks and tend to be a little bit more robust. They can get corrupted just like any other device.\n\n4. Zip disks are a bit old hat and have the same problem as floppy disks avoid avoid avoid! Trust me I have used them and relied too much on them and lost data cos of it.\n\n5. Tape backups (DDS3/4/DAT72) have a good capacity and alot of IT companies use this type of backup but again they are suseptable to corruption similar to floppy disks if kept for any length of time as they are magnetic media, expensive to maintain.\n\n6. SD/MMC cards are similar technology to USB memory sticks as they store the data on a chip(s) but do not normally have the capacity to store alot of data (1GB?) and are very easily lost/broken as they are so small.\n\n7. Online backups are an option but most are insecure and do you want people to have access to your data/photos etc. hmmmm\n\nI suppose there is no 100% safe way of backing up your data (and keeping it safe) but I have found DVD's to be pretty good (using quality DVD's with dark ink), I use DVD-RW as my data changes alot and there is no point in me keeping the old stuff but buy high quality DVD's as cheap and nasty DVD's tend to develop problems later in life.\nI have seen alot of testing done on USB sticks and they have been found to be very tough to break.\n\nIf you are serious about the data you can buy a small fire proof safe as well.\n\nJust my opinon and experience!",8709

Or it could simply be muscle pain from a strained muscle in that area.  Your doctor or nurse practitioner could best test and determine what's going on.  I would see them though to rule out any sort of infection of one of your major organs.  It's kind of high to be appendicitis but that's possible if it's referred pain.

In System, click on the Hardware Tab, then click on the Device Manager button. A window will pop up, this is your Device Manager. Now, you should have a list of Hardware which is installed on your System. Browse down the list and look for Network Adapters. Click on the ""+"" sign to open and read the entries there. If there is no listing for Network Adapters, which there should be as you should have an Ethernet Adapter as the very least, then you do not have any adapters installed. That would be a rare case indeed. Now, the Ethernet Adapter will have either a 10/100 or 10/1000 desription, depending on how new the computer is and if you paid for an upgrade in the Ethernet Adapter. Look for a listing which is not designated as 10/100 or 1000, double click to open Properties and read the desription. You may also have your FireWire listed there, even though it is not really a Network Adaper. FireWire will also be listed in your Network Connections too, why I am not sure, but that is how Windows handles FireWire right now.

2,"how to lose weight? ; i am 11 years old and my weight is 40 kg ; It surprises many people how much weight they can lose in just one week if they start paying attention to exactly how they live their lives. Because most of us have such fast paced, busy lives we tend to do the things that are most convenient, but often this is not what is best for our bodies. Fast food, frozen food, and very little exercise is what is usually most convenient. Luckily, there are ways to make eating healthier and to even fit in some exercise, even if you are one of the very busy!\n\nFirst, you need to look at your diet. Sometimes the things that lead to us being over weight are things that we just take for granted or don’t even really think about. Oddly enough, the biggest culprits are not what we even have to chew we simply have to swallow! Drinks! When you are thirsty and you need to grab something quick you just go to the fridge or the soda machine and crack open that can or bottle of soda. While the soda is mildly refreshing, it’s also packed with calories. If you are drinking even two or three regular sodas per day you’ll find that you are adding anywhere from 600 to 1,000 extra calories every day. If you cut out the regular soda you’ll find that the pounds will start dropping within a couple days. Many people find that they can easily lose up to 20 pounds over the course of just a few months when they stop drinking soda, but the initial weight loss is seen the first week.

0,"Muslim Faith... more detail.? ; Please, no RELIGION IS FAKE ranting :)\n\nSo far all I know is that there is this guy that was illiterate. He heard a voice that was supposedly God and had someone else write it down. He is the only person that can confirm the voice, the only person that heard it, so he is the only active voice in the Koran. They explain the actions of what middle eastern people use to do when they were idolitors and heathans by saying that they just got confused and it was really done ""this way"" by Abraham or Moses or... etc for this and that reason. They pray five times a day. One of the two I know HATES white people... and ctually hates almost everything. He says that if it is not good and he can not make it good, then hate it because that is the right thing to do. He would be an extremist I guess. My other friend that is a Muslim is the most loving, easy spirit you would ever meet. \n\nNow, I know this sounds like ignorant babble, but please help. Please no hateful or uninformative ranting. Thanks! ; You've almost got it. :) God sent angel Gabriel (""Jibreel"" in Arabic) to Muhammad peace be upon him, to relay the Message (The Quran/Koran). So in every case, he got the Message from the angel.\n\nThe Quran is ""The Words of God/Allah"" to Muhammad, to tell the people.\n\nYes, prayer, the one involving prostration (called ""Salat"" or ""salah"") is five times a day. It is good for the body, did you know that oprah and ""experts"" and the like say we should meditate five times a day? coincidence? Well, I do believe it is healthier and more in tune with God to ""visit"" him often, instead of storing it all up for Sundays don't ya think? :D :D Of course, we can pray in our own words (called ""dua"") any time we want, too.\n\nWell, if you know a Muslim who hates white people, he is likely part of a religion called ""The Nation of Islam (NOI)"" which is actually different from orthodox Islam. NOI take their beliefs from Bible AND Quran. Muslims, only from Quran, recognizing the Bible to have errors and The Quran doesn't. (try reading it! you'll be shocked!) If he's not NOI, then still he is wrong to hate any ""race"", please see proof of that in the Quran itself, at http://muttaqun.com/prejudice.html\n\nPlease begin with a primer on the basic beliefs of a Muslim, at http://muttaqun.com/shahada.html\n\nYou can also read the Quran online at http://muttaqun.com/quran and I highly recommend you use The Noble Quran english translation to get the best translation. The footnotes are a super big help, too, as they crossreference verses to help you see the bigger picture, i.e. to help keep it in context.\n\nFinally, you may feel more comfortable simply joining the Muttaqiyyah egroup and ask muslim sisters any questions you want, they are very open to questions there.

I think I've gained about 25 lbs since.  Do you think it's the menopause and Temoxifen combined?  I'm 5'4 & weight about 180...I should be at 135!  Am I ever going to be that weight again? ; I do understand what you are going through.  You may not ever get back to that 135 pounds, but you can get closer to it.  The drugs make it harder, and menopause may have some effect.  But there are things you can do.\n\nIf you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose some weight. You may know that you need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need at least 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Be very conscious of your nutrition.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym.   I'd go the gym route at least to start, if you have never done weight training before.  Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.\n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss. \n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4. even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\n8.  Did your oncology team ever refer you to a dietician?   That may help you.   Also talk to them about your weight concerns and get their opinions.  \n\nI hope these thoughts help. You can do this. Good luck with it.",9143

I live in the middle of it and I know very well.\nSome uneducated or fanatic Shi'a consider the Alawieen are people who deserve utmost respect, regardless of their attitudes.
