5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13

0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

If these ""sleep hygiene"" tips don't work, you may wish to consult a doctor.\n\n1. Avoid caffeine. It sounds like you're already doing this, so good for you! (I'm posting this advice anyway in case others are having similar problems.) Also avoid smoking (as nicotine is a stimulant) and drinking alcohol (which interferes with natural sleep) before bedtime.\n\n2. Try to go to bed and get up the same time each day, even if you don't have to (e.g., on weekends). This will help your body establish a stable sleep schedule.\n\n3. Turn the lights down about an hour before your bedtime. Light sends signals to your brain that it should be awake, and this is not the message you want to send if you want some sleep!\n\n4. Exercise regularly! But avoid exercising a few hours before your bedtime.\n\n5. Take a warm bath or shower before bed. This will help relax you.\n\n6. Drink milk shortly before bedtime, or eat some turkey. Both of these foods contain substances that help promote sleep. Some people have reported success with taking melatonin.\n\n7. Do not use your bed to watch TV, play video games, read, or do your homework. You want your brain to associate being in bed with going to sleep, not other activities.\n\n8. If you find you cannot sleep, don't stay in bed and get anxious about how much sleep you're missing. Instead, get up, and find some relaxing activity you can do (e.g., reading) under dim light until you begin to feel drowsy again.\n\n9. Be careful about taking sleep-inducing medications, as these can be habit-forming and also interfere with the REM (dream) phase of sleep, which is the most refreshing part of sleep.\n\nGood luck!",27

1,"when zinc rod is immeersed in blue colour copper sulphate. blue colour fades away. give reasons.? ; chemistry ; all the information you need is in the handy periodic table.   First, think about the charges of the molecules....\n\n In the molecule CuSO4, copper has two electrons to give.  The SO4 molecule wants TWO more electrons to acheive noble gas configuration (a stable electron state).   This appears to be a match in heaven.  \n\nWell all is fine until Zinc comes along.  If you look at the periodic table, Zinc is just to the right of copper.  It too has 2 electrons to donate......but, it is more electronegative than copper. (remember, electronegativity  is the lowest in the bottom left corner of the table(Fr) and increases on  a diagonal path  with F being the most electronegarive.)  \n\nSince Zinc is more reactive than Copper,  a replacement reaction occurs.  Zinc bumps Copper off of the SO4 molucule.  Zinc can be whitiish to yellowish in solution.  As all the Zinc is coming off the rod, it bumps the copper off the SO4 and also disperses the colour of the copper.  If you had one drop of blue dye (the copper), but added a cup of milk. ( the Zinc)...... you would barely see the blue color.",43

The American People may not stand behind the leaders of the Military, but they do stand behind the troops.  After all, the troops are our Sons and Daughters.

Which team (or teams) will be the lame gimps who are rated highly but then crash and burn?  If I had to guess, my choices will be Notre Dame, Ohio State, USC and Alabama.

1,"If magnetic field of earth is changing continuosly would that effect bird migration patterns?? ; if polarity of earth is changed upside down, would that effect the birds?? ; That is a good question. Some birds and some insects use the magnetic field of the earth to give them clues for navigation, along with landmarks, and polarization of light etc. My guess is that at first they might be a little confused, but they use multiple clues, so they would soon adjust and learn the new pattern. \n\nAfter all, it flips fairly often on earth's time scale.  Apparently on average it flips every 300,000 years, and  the last flip was 780,000 years ago, so we are a bit overdue at the moment. Obviously, the birds have survived through lots of flips, and movements of the earth and landmarks etc. So they will probably survive the next flip too, but not necessarily without some confusion.",107

0,"why is christianity the largest religion in the world? Why is it dominant among other cultures and religions? ; what reasons made christianity dominant among other cultures and religions...why it had expanded over the world...i'm not asking about sentiments in religion here...i'm asking exactly WHY christianity is dominant. Like, say, the Philippines hundreds of years ago was pagan but when the adherent Spaniards came to introduce Christianity, the people of the islands embraced it. And other similar situations where Christianity had expanded. Why it had overcome the former beliefs and former culture of the people who now embrace Christianity.... ; Based on the universal meaning of Christ I will present below, I hope this may better explain why so many people across time and cultures have come to adopt or accept Jesus Christ.  \n\nIf Jesus Christ is the universal Messiah for all people, who rejoins God and humanity as one, then Christ must represent the common love that joins all humanity as one by conscience -- all souls across time, all people of all tribes and nations.  Otherwise, anything less contradicts the meaning of a universal messiah whose sacrifice saves all souls by expunging collective sins and karma from the past that otherwise trap and divide us.\n\nThus if the Bible is true, it makes sense to me that at some point all tribes, nations and tongues -- all religions and even secular systems of thoughts -- will accept Christ in the process of reconciling all our hearts and minds to unify in the spirit of truth and love for all.  Whether we make this choice out of love, out of desperation when physical life fails us, or out of 'survival of the fittest,' history shows that people eventually choose what fulfills us all spiritually, which the message of Christianity offers.\n\nThe Scriptures prophesy that ""every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess.""  And indeed all religions and even pre-Christian myths foretell that a spiritual Messiah will come to bring final salvation.  All religions have a different way of naming or describing this process.  For example, Buddha spoke of a Maitreya Buddha who would come once, and then return a second time to enlighten the world.  Even the goal of secular activists to work for the day that ""Justice will come"" is the same as Jesus coming to bring peace on earth.  And individuals or whole cultures who experience painful spiritual growth through a recovery or grieving process following great tragedy or loss, collectively go through the same process as Jesus dying on the cross to be resurrected. \n\nSince this is a universal theme across religions and cultures, it makes sense that Jesus Christ on the Cross serves as a central symbol of that ultimate break in the vicious cycle of karmic sin and suffering so that humanity can be reconciled with God, and spiritual harmony restored on earth as we visualize in heaven.\n\nAll people and all groups will need to come to a common understanding in Christ or by conscience in order to reach this final mature stage in our spiritual process.  But in that understanding, so will all religions and cultures be equally recognized and all included.  Christianity is not exclusive but all inclusive, so that the message calls to all people.\n\nNo one has to give up their past traditions in order to accept Christ, who ultimately fulfills any laws or teachings whether sacred or secular; but one has to understand the meaning of Christ in order to embrace all people and traditions equally as neighbors.  Because Christ serves as that universal link joining us all, that is why so many different people from different cultures and points in history have recognized and accepted Christ as a natural stage in human spiritual development.",125

So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night. Probably another important thing is to take something like ibuprofen because it will stop the process of inflammation in your joint and help with the pain.

John had a lot to say about lying vs. telling the truth but the tone is there throughout the bible: John 8:32 John 8:44 John 4:23, 24\n\nI’m not touching on the biblical principals vs. the pagan influences of Christmas or Easter or whatever holiday that promotes lying to children I just would like to know why good and decent people make the mistake of lying to kids only to reveal the truth when they are older. \n\nWhy do parent’s lie? ; well...to tell you the truth.....i really dont know y they do that...its pretty much gay...bcoz they give someone else credit for all that stuff that they buy their kids!!!.....but if i were to give you an answer..(this is what my parents used to say when i asked y they lied) i would have to say just to give christmas a little more *magic*...bcoz if it was just for jesus's b-day they prolly wouldnt care.....i mean y would they get all excited about the day he was born.....i for sho wouldnt...the only b-day i looked forward to was mine(of course), and my friend chelsea's(she always had parties at hotels lol).....anyways....yeah....tahts y they lie about santa...bcoz they want their kids to look forward to seeing this big fat guy in a red suit deliver presents all around the world....bcoz frankly THEY DONT CARE ABOUT JESUS'S BDAY!!..and the smae thing is wiht Easter...they want the big ol mr easter bunny to give them candy filled eggs......they dont care about his crucifiction...they care about the gifts and condy and all that good stuff!!!!  hope this helped(lol i know i babble on about bs crap..sorryy!!:D)",416

2,"how to get a flat stomach? ; i have a puffy sort of tough stomach. i've been doing crunches for a month and i see no changes whats so ever. It runs in my family, and it's embarassing to wear shirts because people ask if i'm pregnant WHEN I'M NOT. help i'm 13, 5'4 and 120 lbs. it's been puffy ever since i was born HELOP! ; I've had the same difficulty you have.  At the age of 29, I am able to embarass the asker by saying, ""no honey, it's just fat"" when they ask how many months pregnant I am...  But from my own experience at your age, I remember that they just won't believe you in school.  \n\nThe only things I can tell you follow the lines of your other answerers.  The crunches are a good start, and they can work well with other torso exercises.  (However, be sure you ""sit-up"" as you exhale or it can make the problem worse!)  The torso exercises are usually some form of exercise involving small weights (3lb or so, you don't want to bulk up!) and doing repetitive movements swinging from side/down to opposite side/up.  \n\nYou also might want to try walking, paired with arm swinging.  It looks strange, but if you have the bent elbows and actually move them consciously -- not just swinging by reflex -- it's supposed to help your torso get into shape.  There are also elastic stretch-bands that you can use to do leg exercises, and these will help tone as well.  \n\nOne other thing is the water suggestion.  You know the old health suggestion to drink 6-8 glasses of water a day?  Well, that's not caffeinated soda -- it's water!  Caffeine is a problem in this also.  Water will literally help to ""wash out"" your system, and initially it may help you to lose 5 lbs and its corresponding inches quickly.  It also keeps you hydrated and feeling like you have more energy, which will help you to become more active.  Moving around can help with that also.  \n\nLast, you are 13 and likely in your growth spurt stages now, and the abdomenal muscles will likely slim down as you grow.  Some of the ""pudgy"" people I knew in elementary and junior high school became the very slender people in high school!  At your age, it's never too early to begin exercising and drinking water -- but don't go to any extremes or begin starving yourself.  The exercise and water should help you now, and it will continue to be helpful all your life if you make it a regular habit.",474

4,"how do i resolve undetermined externals in C++ ?? ; I am working on a project right now.. and i am getting 1 unresolved external error.. what can i do to fix this? ; There are a few typical reasons for unresolved\nexternals in C++.  \n\nThe simplist cause is that you forgot to link in a\nrequired library.  I'm not proficient with Windows,\nbut on a Unix/Linux/Solaris machine, you can search\nthrough libraries using ""nm"" to find the missing\nsymbol (and then specify that library on your linker\ninvocation).\n\nMaybe the next simplist cause would be that you\nactually are missing a symbol (ie. because of an\n#ifdef or some oversight in your Makefile, some\nsource file didn't compile).  Look for the symbol\nin the source and make sure that file is correctly\ncompiled.  [By the way, it is quite possible that\nyour linker will report ""mangled"" names which\nincorporate the class hierarchy of the type of\nthe symbol.  You may wish to filter your linker\noutput through something to reconstitute the\noriginal symbol name.  On many systems, this filter\nis called ""c++filt"", but I've also seen it called\n""dem"" (as in demangler).]\n\nFinally, in C++, I've seen another cause of unresolved\nsymbols being short-comings in the template instantiation\nsystem.  In the general case, the compilation system\nshould detect the use of templates and create the\nnecessary versions where and when needed, but some\ncompilers provide more limited support.  In those cases,\nit may be necessary to explicitly instantiate the \nmissing template.  Take a good look at the unresolved\nsymbol (particularly if you can ""demangle"" the name)\nto see if it looks like it should be provided by one\nof your (or the system's) templates.  That would be\nthe clue that this is an instantiation problem.",592

GER-CRC had lots of goals, and was closer than the final score suggests.  TUN-SDA was just had a great second half, with a very late equalizer.  POR-NED was pretty exciting in part because it was a close game, but mainly because the referee made a spectacle of himself.

The main security feature of Firefox is the fact that it lacks ActiveX controls which is why IE has so many security holes... also IE is still far more common than Firefox so IE is attacked more then Firefox.  That doesn't mean there aren't exploits for Firefox but most of them are harmless and will just cause Firefox to crash and all you have to do is clear the cache and restart Firefox, no harm done.  The reason IE is so terrible is because the ActiveX controls are tied into the operating system so it is possible should an exploit be present, for someone to hijack your system.  I know of no such exploit for Firefox, though, I could be wrong.\n\nJust use Firefox, it's better, http://www.mozilla.com/",719

My friend who is a year older and went there told me that ""everyone"" plays Ultimate at Stuy. Being impressionable and younger, I figured I better learn too. I played for the boys' Sticky Fingers team through high school. I got to play at the high school national championships back when it was held in Washington DC.\n\nAfter high school, I went to Oberlin College in Ohio. I continued my Ultimate career by attending early season tryouts for the college team. There were barely enough people on the team to play 7-on-7 full size games. We played co-ed (mixed gender) in the fall, then single-gender in the spring (collegiate championships season). I eventually went on to captain the team, and the men's team made it to College Nationals.\n\nAfter college, I moved to Seattle, Washington, where I tried out for, but didn't make the second tier men's club team. I spent a season getting serious about training, and eventually made it onto one of the second tier teams. Continuing on with training, I eventually made it on to the top men's team in town. The team qualified for the club national championships where we finished second - losing to some team from Boston in the finals. I was put in for one point that game. (Which was pretty good considering there were earlier elimination games I didn't play in at all.)\n\nI eventually played for another evolution of a second tier men's team in town. After a few fun seasons with that team, I went on to start a co-ed (mixed gender) team. We finished well in the regional championships, but never good enough to make it to Nationals.\n\nMore than 22 years after I first started playing Ultimate, I once again live in Brooklyn, New York, and play casual pick-up Ultimate in Prospect Park a couple of times a month.

I dont feel sick, actually i feel pretty good, what could cause this? ; Enlarged lymph nodes such as swollen glands in the neck are lymph glands which are a part of the lymph system and an important part of your body's immune system. These swollen lymph nodes / glands in the neck, usually do not indicate acute leukemia, lymphoma cancer or lymph node cancer.  Early symptoms of leukemia, symptoms of lymphoma, the types of leukemia, and the causes of leukemia are covered below if you have concerns of lymph cancer or lymphoma symptoms or have been diagnosed. The truth is that tender and swollen lymph nodes usually indicate an infection and should be addressed by supporting the body naturally and building up the immune system to fight the problem. Another situation where swollen lymph nodes may be noticed is after injury to the body as the lymph glands are responsible for protecting the body from infection.",839

4,"Wireless Connection Keeps Disconnecting? ; I have a laptop that works perfectly when connected to my wireless network; however, whenever I am connected to a friend's network, I am constantly kicked off every 30 seconds or so.  The other people using this network don't have any problems.  Is this a configuration issue? ; It might be a configuration issue or as the other person stated a problem with the access point you are trying to connect to as well.   Part of the answer will depend how on well you know your equipment and the equipment your trying to connect to.  There are multiple versions of the 802.11 versions out there. A B G N as previously mentioned, I don't believe N has been ratified yet, and it is unlikely you have A.  Probably 802.11B or 802.11G which are pretty standard installs in most machines.  You can start by making sure that you are compatibale with the access point your are trying to connect to.  Wireless networks can be set to only accept clients from certain bands, such as only G or B clients.  If your sure you have interoperability, then check to make sure the SSID or the broadcast name of the AP is also setup in your machine.  Most SSIDs are broadcast openly and will allow a machine to connect even if the connection is unsecured and will do this automatically.  If the SSID is not broadcasting you'll have to get the name and setup a new SSID.  I have noticed on XP that sometimes, it will note the connection is unsecured and wants confirmation before connection is established.  There are diagnostic tools in most laptop machines that will give you more information that will help decide where your problem is coming from.  If the connection is not using defaults, you may be experiencing issues from a security standpoint.  More advanced users will setup security on the AP itself which will require a WEP key before connection is established.  You'll have to find out if this is the case.  Another common problem I have seen with people attempting to connect to an AP is ad-hoc networks.  People initally setting up a SSID will tell the machine to create a connection where the laptop/machine itself becomes similar to a AP although more for a peer-to-peer connection, without ever realizing it.  If your familiar with XP, it uses different icons to distinguish between ad-hocs and APs.  If you are getting stronger connection to an ad-hoc and have not told your machine to connect to an AP infrastructure by default it can also attempt to use the ad-hoc before the AP.  ( Change this on the Advanced button on the bottom of the Wireless network connection properties window.)  On a XP machine, it will usually give you an indicator in the taskbar on the right, with some idea of what might be wrong.  If your connection is leaving you without an IP address you might try to verify that the connection you are trying to establish is the correct one.  Worst comes to worse, remove all the SSIDs that are located under the wireless network connection properties window and try to reconnect.  Right clicking on the wireless icon will also give you the option to View Available Wireless Networks, which might also give you an idea of the problem.\nI am of course assuming your running an XP machine and are familiar enough to find most of the spots I have mentioned.\nHope this helps you figure out your problem.",879

I'm also a huge person, so I'd probably lose weight faster. ; If you have a lot of weight to lose you might be able to lose that much safely in that time frame, but it nmay not be easy.  I will include an answer I wrote recently about a person whose friend needed to lose over 200 pounds.  Take from it whatever makes sense for you ....\n\nYour friend definitely needs to see a doctor when losing this much weight. Yes, good nutrition and exercise will work, but your friend needs medical support to rule out and/or control some medical issues that could be going on as part of obesity - type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems, to name a few.\n\nYour friend will need gentle exercise at first. He may need to start simply by taking a five minute walk. For weight loss purposes several five minute walks throughout the day to start are better than one 40 minute walk, for example. Gradually as he gets more comfortable and more fit, increase the length of the walks until he is able to do 2 or 3 walks of 30 minutes each every day. As this is happening he will also automatically gradually increase speed as he gets fitter and so he will get more exercise. He will also need to begin, in time, to incorporate some weight training (lifting) into his routine to build muscle.\n\nYour friend needs to focus on better food choices - lots of fresh fruit, vegetables, lean meat and fish, whole grains, skim milk and low fat dairy products. A person who weighs as much as your friend does can actually eat considerably more food than a person of normal weight, especially if he is getting a little exercise. He needs to learn about the calories, fat content, protein and carb content of various foods so that he can figure out how much is ok. There are many great websites that will help. Two that I especially like are www.nutrawatch.com and www.caloriesperhour.com. They are both free. \n\nLosing this much weight is a complicated process. Your friend must really want to do this. It takes a lot of motivation and will power and self control, especially in the first few weeks. He needs to be ready to change his life style, his behavior, his eating habits. He may be eating for emotional reasons, so that might need to be addressed through counselling. It will be a long term process, not a quick fix.\n\nGood luck to you and your friend. Remember that the longest journey begins with the tiniest step. \n\n\nThe website www.nutrawatch.com may help you.",963
2,"Mirena or Paraguard? Which is more healthy? Are there significant amounts of hormones in the Mirena IUD? ; I have had problems with the Pill's hormones and having migranes. I went off the Pill and now I don't experience the migraines I used to. I want to get an IUD but don't know which one would be best for my health. Do the hormones in the Mirena IUD cause migraines in anyone? I know that Mirena is the most effective, I just don't want to suffer with migraines because of it. Advice please. ; Mirena IUD:\nHow it works:  It is inserted into the uterus and is about the size of a quarter.  Mirena contains a type of progestin called levonorgestrel, which blocks sperm and alters the lining of the uterus, interrupting implantation of a fertilized egg.  Modern IUD's don't pose a high risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.  In fact, the hormone in Mirena helps shrink uterine fibroids, decreases menstrual cramping, can reduce blood loss by 97% and may lower your risk of endometrial cancer. If the birth control pill you were taking contained levonorgestrel then you might get migraines from the IUD, but it is unlikely since you are not ingesting the hormone.  It provides protection for 5 years.\n\nParagard IUD:\nHow it works: It is inserted the same way as Mirena, but it works differently; instead of hormones, Paragard contains copper, which kills sperm.  It provides protection for 10 years. Research shows that Paragard may lower your risk of developing endometrial cancers, though experts aren't sure why.  \n\nThere is also an an implant that is not yet available, but will be soon, called Implanon.  A single matchsticklike implant is inserted into your upper arm.  The implant, which should be approved by the FDA this year, releases a low dose of Progestin into your body. It blocks ovulation and thickens cervical mucus so the sperm cannot enter for up to three years.  It is 100% effective, whereas the Paragard and Mirena is only 99% and 99.9% effective.",965

In the months following 9/11 President Bush could have asked us to do almost anything, I think. Instead he told us to go shopping and then in February he began beating the drum for the long-sought for War in Iraq.\n\nThe war isn't popular as it is. Most of us don't really have anything vested in it. I personally know ONE guy over there and he's not family. And that's when Bush has asked nothing from this country for the war---the money is borrowed from the Chinese, there's no rationing, no homefront commandos, no war bonds, no victory gardens, no raised taxes.  Supporting the war means paying lipservice and that's it. If you support the war it's because you also support the President and his ""spend and borrow, and it's all about me"" philosophy, which would naturally preclude actually doing something for the war effort.\n\n\n""Hmmm probably alot more than the anti war idiots, who do not have the guts to go to the middle east in person to kiss the terrorists *sses!""\n\nSweet Seductress,  that's a cheap shot.

Hematomas or contusions (or ""bumps"" and ""bruises"") develop when blood and scared tissue coagulates under the epidermis (top skin). \n\nHere is how to treat it:\n""For contusions (bruises), treatment consists of initially applying ice or cold packs a few times a day, to produce vasoconstriction (a reduction in arterial blood flow) which helps to decrease hemorrhage (bleeding) and edema (swelling).\n\nIn general, the quicker you apply ice after the injury, the less bleeding will result.\n\nIf possible, elevate the bruised limb. Blood will leave the area of the wound and there may be less swelling. Resting the limb will also help to prevent further injury.\n\nIf the area is still painful after about 48 hours, apply gentle heat with warm towels, a hot water bottle, or a heating pad. The heat is applied for 20 minutes at a time to promote absorption and repair. Since heat causes swelling and increases tissue fluid, which may impair function, hot compresses may be followed by cold applications to minimize the secondary effects of heat.\n\nPressure in the form of an elastic adhesive bandage may be helpful to reduce hemorrhage and swelling. If infection should develop in the wound, the signs and symptoms might be increasingly severe pain, a fever of 101 degrees or more, swelling with surrounding redness, and pus. If any of these signs appear, your physician should be notified to make sure there are no additional problems.""",1180

What do you think? ; Basically you have 2 choices stop doing activities that cause you pain or have the surgery.  The surgery consists of a plastic screw being inserted into the shoulder, the tendon is then weaved into another piece of flat plastic that is then attached to the screw to hold the tendon into place.  The recuperation time is around 6 months and you'll need physical therapy during that time.  It takes along time to heal because there's no way to actually reattach the tendon permanently.

Do it in the windows safe mode. (AVG and avast antivirus softwares are free while a 6 month free trial for Norton is available at pack.google.com. Lavasoft's free Ad-Aware is the best antispyware to my knowledge. Also Windows Defender from Microsoft is good enough for real-time protection). This should identify the problem and most probably would solve it as well. However, if the antivirus software is unable to delete the malware, go to thier website and search for the name of the malware detected. Their must be some instructions posted to tackle the problem. You might have to delete the system restore points and as well delete the particular registry entries manually if the virus still regenerates on subsequent boot up of the machine. Good Luck.\n\nPS. If you are still having trouble, use Hijack This and copy the log it generates and post it on some tech help forum. I am sure there will be plenty of people ready to help you out.",1230

It's likely  registered voters of the opposing party would mostly vote against the incumbent, meaning the incumbent would need to spend his entire first year in office campaigning to protect himself against being voted out.  If this were the case, the President would have no track record to go on.  It would cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars more in campaign funds that could go to better use, and would distract the executive branch, the media, and the general public from focusing on real issues.  \n\nThe ultimate solution to this is for voters to do some more research before they vote.

Many people know that the celebration of Christmas on December 25 was just a catholic means to fool the pagans into using their celebrations of the winter equinox as a religious event. True Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus every day. The Bible doesn’t say exactly when Jesus was born, but if you have ever been to Israel you know that the shepherds are not watching there flocks by night all seated on the ground. Any shepherd worth his salt has his sheep in a shelter and he is home in front of a good fire as winter in Israel can get very cold.\nHalloween- This one should be obvious. Christians or even JW don’t allow for the celebrating of demons. \nMother’s day and Father’s Day- This is just basics, the commandments say we should honor our Father and Mother… That means all the time not one just a special day.\nBirthday- Here is where the JW’s get a little strange; in a birthday celebration for King Herod a young girl pleases him with her dance. He gives his word that she can have anything she wanted. What she wanted was the head of john the Baptist on a platter. Herod granted this wish. So the beheading of John the Baptist has been associated with birthdays so the JW’s do nothing to celebrate birthdays.",1318

3,"If you asked to write asucessful essay about &#92;ascool to give the students the skillsand knowwledges needed ; elements can include , but are not limited to iportant physical chracteristics of the school ; Well first, you need to be sure your grammar and spelling are impeccable so people will take you seriously. Second your question is a fragment and does not make much sense. I think you are asking what skills and knowledge should be included in a school to make it successful? If that is the case there are hundreds of possible answers. My opinion on this matter is not always liked but it would be effective. Here is what I think (you best be careful with stealing ideas though as much of this is written in a paper I did). First, you need a sound building in which to house your school so the kids will be safe, secure, and have an environment conducive to learning. You also need to be sure the building is located in an area that will serve the students you wish to serve.\nSecond, you need a well developed curricular objective. What is the purpose of your school? Vision statement? Goals? Objectives? among other questions. You also need to define what your school is. Is it a private school or a public school or something in the middle? \nSkills wise I believe we need to concentrate on the basics FIRST. Reading, Writing, Math, Science, and Social Studies are the most important subjects. Depending on the focus of your school will depend on which are the most important. The federal government would argue with you that Reading and Math are most important but I do not believe you place one core subject above another. I also believe schools do not do enough with teaching students to WRITE a good sentence, paragraph, essay, or paper. \nOther than those basic assumptions of a school it comes down to the focus of your educational mission. If your school is a high school geared toward technology then you should be providing students with skills in the fields of technology. If your school is a middle school that is to prepare students to get into a particular high school then you should tailor your program towards the requirements of that school. If you are a college prep school then you need to immerse your students in college prep classes to build the skills necessary for college study. This could go on forever!\n\nStart with a mission plan, goal, and objectives to establish your educational mission. Then the rest will flow off of that thought.\n\nhope that helps....",1398

Can someone please answer that question, I just wanna know what happened to politics and when did this all hapen? ; Well who ever is in power are the good guys and the one's out of power are the rednecks.  You can track it back till the civil war.  Linclon was a Republican and until the depression they ran things so the Democrats were the rednecks.\n\nThen Roosevelt was elected and the Democrats slowly gained power.  He started setting up a bunch of welfare handout programs which was continued all the way through Johnson.  The democrats ran things for about 40 years until 1994, and the Republicans became the Rednecks.\n\nThe Republicans never were able to shake the redneck thing and have once again lost power so by next year they will officially become the Redneck party.",1488

5,"Y is that the '82 Brazil team is consider by many the best BRAZL team even tho they didnt get to the final? ; Every one tells me that the 1982 brazil team is the best team ever even though they didn't win the championship, why??!!!!!!!!!! ; The 1982 Brazil team played some of the best attacking football ever seen, and has some great players in the team. Sitting back to defend just wasn't in their vocabulary, and in the build up to the world cup they swept all aside with some breath taking displays.\n\nThey started the world cup finals well too. They comfortably qualified top of their group, to enter a second group stage. They were unfortunate though, because in the second group stage they did not face weaker teams, as the draw had been designed to produce, but defending champions Argentina and Italy, both of whom had started slowly in the competition. However, they beat Argentina 3-1, and only needed a draw to progress to the next round against Italy.\n\nItaly started well, and scored an early goal, but Brazil piled on the pressure and brought the game back to 1-1. At this point, they only had to close up shop and see the game out - but that wasn't their mentality. They carried on attacking, and left themselves venerable at the back. The Italians scored again, and led until 20 minutes from the end, when Brazils attacking play finally made it 2-2.\n\nAnother defensive mistake was to blame for the third Italian goal, and thanks to some heroics from the Italian keeper Zoff, the game finished 3-2.\n\nBrazil had been knocked out, but had played some superb football and had, perhaps, reminded people across the world how football could be played.\n\nFor this reason there 1982 team will always be remembered as one of the greatest teams of all time.",1506

9,"I'm told the U.S. welcomes Iraqi citizens fleeing their war torn country, how can i find out more on that info ; Any other countries besides jordan, iran, and syria welcoming to iraqis fleeing their war torn country? ; Amnesty International defines a refugee as: ""A refugee is a person who is outside her country of origin and genuinely risks serious human rights abuses because of who she is or what she believes. She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

McNair leaving Titans/going to Ravens- This is a good or bad move for both teams. now with mcnair gone, Vince Young has a chance to shine, which could be good or bad due to his age.

I mean, if you only see a team's weaknesses, then you'll end up not supporting any team.

When is everyone going to relize that christianity is about your own personal walk with Christ?  God gives eveybody a choice to do exactly what they want to do. So if a person wants to go to church, claim Christ as their savior, pray and then turn around and kill somebody, then they just have that choice, God didn't create robots.  You cant associate the personal choices of people with those of all christians.  That's just like saying because a white guy with a beard robbed you, then all white guys with beards are theives. If some christians judge or do wrong, then they'll have to deal with God themselves, but for a person to use that as an excuse to reject christianity is stupid. When we all go to judgement and stand before God, he's not going to accept you saying that the only reason u didn't accept him was because of someone else's walk with him. It's about what YOUR choice is. So whats your pick? ; You make a number of excellent observations, but trying to convince or convert in this type of forum is at best a crap shoot.

Why are they different ; Need it! it's urgent! ; The shape of the molecule depends on how many electrons and bonds you have in the outer shell of the central atom.\nFor NH3, N is the central atom. It has 3 covalent bonds and a lone pair. Thus the repulsion of the lone pair electrons and the bond electrons will force them to arrange at the corners of a tetrahedral. The molecule will look as a trigonal pyramid (since the lone pair is not ""visible"" in the structure.\n\nFor BH3, B is the central atom and has no lone pair apart from the three bonds.

That is, in order for the universe to behave in the manner that it is, there should be enough matter to generate the proper amount of gravity, but we can only see about a third(?) of the amount of matter required.

1,"Will the spin of galaxies ever stop? ; Do the laws of physics postulate that the spinning of galaxies/planets/moons will eventually slow to a stop or is it infinitely perpetual? (Bare with me. I have no physics education) ; carljoseph has the correct answer.  The galaxies have no reason to stop spinning any more than the planets have a reason to stop orbiting the sun.  (Eric p, I don't know why you think the law of perpetual motion does not apply to circular motion.)  There is no continuous force that *keeps* them in motion ... it's just momentum from the process that formed the  galaxies (or the solar systems), and there is no counter-force (like air resistance) slowing them down.  Now it's possible that there is infinitessimal resistance due to space dust, but there's nothing in the laws of physics that says that a rotating object (like a galaxy or a solar system) must eventually stop rotating.  So they will continue to turn indefinitely.\n\nNow, some of these stars will explode at some times in their lifespan, and may or may not leave behind the burned out shells (mostly iron, the most stable atomic nucleus there is) of dead stars and planets, but the galaxies will continue to spin as long as there are stars (or star remnants) in them.",1834

5,"Good question for BEARS fans? ; IF GROSSMAN IS ON, THEN WHO WOULD WIN IF THE 1985 BEARS PLAYED THE 2006 BEARS ; Easy one! There is no doubt whatsoever that the 1985 Bear would crush today's or the 2006 Bears.\n\nThe 1985 team was far more resourceful; it also had much better depth at each position. In 1985 one didn't ask, ""...if Grossman is on..."" because even if McMahon wasn't on one didn't wonder about the win--it was more of a question of by how much.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the 85' Chicago Bears were one of, if not the best football team of all time. They were also the team that started the ""Demolition Derby"" Super Bowl by just crushing the Pats, by the way, who was an excellent team.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, 85' had Big Mike Ditka who revolutionized the game by doing what it took to win all the way to the ""Fridge"".",1878
9,"Why do some people get off during the justice system? ; I was wondering how someone can commit the same crimes as someone else, but somehow they can hire a great attorney and they can get off with a slap on the wrist.

How do sex offenders get off with only a few years and some have to serve longer. shouldn't they all serve the same if they commited the  same cime. How do people often get off due to loop holes and technicallities that the attorney finds to get them off.

0,"Why do people keep talking about agnostics believing in a god? ; From Merriam-Webster:\n\nMain Entry: 1ag·nos·tic \nPronunciation: ag-'näs-tik, &g-\nFunction: noun\nEtymology: Greek agnOstos unknown, unknowable, from a- + gnOstos known, from gignOskein to know -- more at KNOW\n1 : a person who holds the view that any ultimate reality (as God) is unknown and probably unknowable; broadly : one who is not committed to believing in either the existence or the nonexistence of God or a god\n2 : a person unwilling to commit to an opinion about something <political agnostics> \n- ag·nos·ti·cism  /-t&-""si-z&m/ noun \n\n\nNotice that first definition... doesn't believe or disbelieve in God or a god.\n\n\nIf you are agnostic, you do not believe in a deity, nor do you deny a deity.\n\nIf you believe in a deity, you're a theist, not agnostic. ; I think they're referring to agnostic theists, those who think there is no way to know absolutely if there is a god, but believe in one anyway.\n\nAccording to Theism, the opinion that gods or deities exist, and Agnosticism is that existence unknown or inherently unknowable. Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

5,"WHAT will Ivan Basso bring to the Discovery Channel Team? ; He has signed with them ; Awesome news!\n\n  I was unaware of this, so thanks for the good news.\nIvan is a great cyclist, with a great attitude and one of the best mountain climbers in the world (easily in the top 5).\nI think Basso is a much better fit with the Discovery Team then with his old CSC team. \n\nI'm also a big fan of Tyler Hamilton, who was suspended, due to doping (wrongly) accusations two years ago. Tyler has a very similar riding style, when compared with Ivan Basso.\n\nRemember all of the past TDFs where Lance Armstrong and Hamilton where always side by side on the mountain. stages? I don't know if Ivan would be able to endure the pain that Tyler did in the 2003 TDF, where at the end of stage 1, he was involved in a 35 rider accident where he broke his collar-bone in two places. He continued on to win the 17th stage and finish the Tour in 4th place overall.\n\nSo, as far as Discovery Team taking on Tyler's 28 year old, Ex-CSC teammate, Ivan Basso?  It should be an awesome move for everyone involved. \n\nI could easily see Ivan taking the Discovery team back to the Yellow, hopefully restoring the world's confidence in an American team once again.\n\nI can hardly wait!\n\nResponse to Ross:\n\n   By the way Ross, watch that stage again!  Ivan never beat Lance! That mountain stage win was a courtesy win given as a gift to Basso from Armstrong. Lance has a lot of respect for Basso and considered him to be a rider that could one day take his place. Watch the tour footage and you'll see Lance wave Basso on before reaching the finish. Lance gave up several yellow jerseys to other riders that he felt deserved it, as long as he had the overall lead, that was all that matterd to Lance.\n\nResponse to Doping Accusations by the (angry) Europeans:\n\nI myself, have never touched a drug in my life, yet years ago I tested positive twice, by the sport I was involved in. I retested again and was found innocent on both accounts.\n\nThan again when I was 17, I failed a polygraph that I was completely truthful on. I didn't get the job I was applying for, but I learned an important life lesson, not all test are fair and without fault.\n\nAs far as Floyd Landis, I can't be sure one way or the other. I hope that Landis is innocent, but that jury is still out for now.\n\nAs far as Tyler Hamilton, I without a doubt believe that he was wrongfully accused and hopefully he will soon be vindicated.\n\nEuropeans: Get over it!

It is immoral to kidnap. I think we all agree that these crimes are wrong both legally and morally.\n\nThere are plenty of issues of morality that the law deals with that we might agree on. In several states, sodomy is illegal. Drug use is illegal. Minors buying tobacco is illegal. Are these issues morally wrong? A good debate with arguments from each side could be made.\n\nOn to Constitutional amendments. The Constitution creates and protects our beliefs as a country. Amendment 13 bans slavery. Amendment 14 banned ex-Conferates from holding national office. Article 18 banned alcohol in the US and Article 21 repealed it. All of these amendments (and many more) deal with moral issues that we, as a society, have decided are either right or wrong.\n\nConstitutional amendment are designed to deal with more specific issues rather than broad issues, and the specific areas you discuss are prime areas for a Constitutional amendment.

Eat until you are stuffed with all the fresh, raw, or canned vegetables.  Try to eat green leafy veggies and stay away from dry beans, peas, and corn. Eat along with the soup.  At dinner time on this day, reward yourself with a big baked potato and butter.  Do not eat any fruits.\n\nDAY THREE:  Eat all the soup, fruits, and vegetables you want.  Do not have a baked potato.  If you have eaten for three days as above, and have not cheated, you will have lost 5 to 7 pounds.\n\nDAY FOUR:  Bananas and skim milk. Eat as many as 8 bananas and drink as many glasses of water as you can on this day along with the soup.  Bananas are high in calories and carbohydrates and so is the milk, but on this particular day your body will need the potassium and \nthe carbohydrates, proteins and calcium to lessen your craving for sweets.\n\nDAY FIVE:  Beef and tomatoes.  You may have 10 to 20 ounces of beef and a can of tomatoes or as many as 6 fresh tomatoes on this day.  Try to drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water\nthis day to wash away the acid in your body.  Eat the soup at least once this day.\n\nDAY SIX:  Beef and veggies.  Eat to your heart's content of the beef and vegetables this day.  You can even have two or three steaks if you like with the green leafy vegetables, but no baked potato.  be sure and eat the soup.\n\nDAY SEVEN:  Brown rice, unsweetened fruit juices and vegetables. Again, stuff yourself.  Be sure to have the soup at least once today.\n\nAt the end of the seventh day, if you have not cheated on the above diet, you will have lost 10 to 17 pounds.  If  you have lost more than 17 pounds, stay off the diet for two days before resuming again from day one.\n \nThis seven day eating plan can be used as often as you like.  As a matter of fact, if correctly followed, it will clean your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being as never before.\n\nAfter only seven days of this process, you will begin to feel lighter by at least 10 and possibly 17 pounds, having an abundance of energy.  Continue this plan as long as you wish and feel the difference.\n\nThis diet is fast, fat-burning, and the secret is that you will burn more calories than you take in. It will flush your system of impurities and give you a feeling of well-being.  This diet does not lend itself to drinking any alcoholic beveragesat any time because of the removal of fat build-up in your system.  Go off the diet at least 24 hours before any intake of alcohol.\n\nBecause everyone's digestive system is different, this diet will affect everyone differently.  After day three, you will have more energy than when you began, if you did not cheat.  After\nbeing on this diet for several ",2357

Tough choice, but you can't go wrong with either, so you make the decision there.    \n\nBroussard is great at home vs. righties, but he does not start vs. lefties, so you are limited there.  You may put him on the bench and save him for the righty @ home situations and check the waiver wire for an every day 1B.  Prince Fielder?  Cuddyer?  Cuddyer could platoon with Broussard, play Cuddyer vs. lefties and Broussard vs. righties.  That will help your 1B problem and with the open roster spots you'll have by dropping 2 catchers.  \n\nVidro is average at best.  Again, check the waiver wire for someone along the lines of a Dan Uggla or Jose Castillo.  Another suggestion here is to BENCH Vidro, move Bill Hall to 2nd base, and you need to be starting Morgan Ensberg every day at 3B.\n\nBill Hall is a MUST KEEP, regardless of what I have seen others say on here.  Leave him in your team but move him to 2B as I said above and start Ensberg every day.  \n\nYou are in need of some outfielders, and if you drop 2 of your catchers, you should be able to add 1 outfielder and start him everyday.  Check the waiver wire for Marcus Thames or Curtis Granderson.  They will provide you with more HR, RBI than what you have now.  Crawford and Rios are EVERY day starters, so adding one of the guys I mentioned will solidify your outfield considerably.  If one of those 2 are not available, consider J. Encarnacion who is starting to get comfortable at the plate since he is not pulling his head as bad as earlier in the season.  He is seeing the ball well.  \n\nPitching is fine, you just need to be patient with what you have because you have a quality staff.  If you feel the need to add a starter, then check the waiver wire for Gil Meche, and any young starters who have been up for less than a month and have done well that may have snuck under the radar in your league.  If Jered Weaver is available, pick him up because although he is being sent down to the minors for a few weeks, he WILL be back within the month and have a solid 2nd half of the season.  \n\nClosers, well, depending on your league, there are probably not any closers available for the taking.  You can propose a trade I supoose, but I am not a big trade kind of guy, so.....if you propose a trade, you could use Coco Crisp and one of your cathcers as trade bait for a mediocre closer such as Fuentes(Rockies) or Rivera(Yankees) who is having a down year, but still will get you the saves you need.  Wagner is your only save guy, Howry is pretty worthless in the fantasy baseball world, so he could be dropped and you could utilize his rister spot for some of the players I listed above.  You could use one more quality closer to ensure you get more opportunities for saves.  Call me crazy but, the closer for KC, A. Burgos(3 for 3 in Save opps in last 3 opportunities) has been getting better of late and may be worth a look if he is available.  \n\nHope this helps your team.  Good Luck the rest of the year.",2427

What's done is done. But that does not mean that we should not TRY to take measures to keep them out, or that we should give up all our laws and throw open our hands and borders to any and everyone.  I mean if you knew that your house was infested with termites, would you just let them destroy your house? or would you do something about it? I dont believe that illegal immigrants are termites.  Just trying to make a point.  Just because the problem already exists, does not mean that you dont take measure to try to protect yourself.\n\nAnd I think the whip should be cracked. This issue is not a matter of free speech, because our rights are reserved for the ""legal"" citizens of this country. I think it is not very smart to be doing something illegal, and then making it known that you are doing it. \n\nPeople who are here illegally are breaking the law. There are steps that can be taken to be here legally and they should take them. It may be a difficult process, but as we all know Freedom isn't free, and if you want it bad enough, you should be willing to do what it takes to get it through legal means.\n\nI mean, the protests of illegal people in this country bothers me. I mean what would happen if child molesters decided to protest the laws against child molesting. We would all say, that's crazy! How can they be ""in the wrong"" and demand the laws be changed so that they can do what they want. I don't think it is right. The best way to resolve the problem is to make it prohibitive for illegal people to be here, and beneficial for legal immigrants to be here. Our laws are there for a reason, America is not a free for all...and if you want to be a part of its citizenry, then you must follow the laws like the rest of the citizens. \n\nWhat gets me is all these people using emotionalism and saying that ""human rights"" are being violated. How is it a violation of human rights to tell people who entered this country illegally, got jobs, and basically are squatters and cheaters that at long last, YOU MUST DO THE RIGHT THING! \n\nI think they do not understand what the definition of ""Human Rights"" is. They are not being treated inhumanely, they are actually fortunate. Because they are being treated as any other American Citizen who breaks the law. ACTUALLY they are being treated BETTER than any other American Citizen who breaks the law. How many U.S. citizens do you know, can break the law, admit to it, protest about it....and not be punished unless or until congress decides to re-write the law in an effort to be as fair to THEM as possible. Come on! Just because they took low paying jobs and work hard at them, does not mean that they are free to break the law. And if we allow them to do it, then the country they are so eager to live in will cease to be the country it is supposed to be. \n\nIf what illegal immigrants want to do is to work, raise families, and live in a free society. Then, follow the LEGAL process to do so, learn the language, and the culture, pay your taxes, and become an American the right way!\n\nDon't break the law and then scream victim! You are not victims. The tax payers who support social programs are victims, the people who migrate to this country and become legal citizens are victims. Illegal immigrants are people who made a ""CHOICE"" to do the WRONG thing, and think they should be excused or rewarded for that choice. I say WAKE UP, take responsibility for your actions, and GET LEGAL or leave.",2551

Actually the law is kinda stupid considering that passengers are still required to wear a helmet. Guess that way if the driver only has one and picks someone up they can hand theirs over. Personally I hope he gets better, yet I still think he should proably wear a helmet. Although depending on the one he wore all it would have prevented was the gash to the back of his head.

Please, only serious replies, no jokes...... ; Well, he can start out by changing the way he eats.  Help him out, both of you make it a point to eat healthy.  He will start to lose weight from a better diet.  As far as exercise, he should just walk as far as he can, a few times a day.  He will gradually be able to go for longer and longer.  He should shoot for 30 minutes of activities a day, even if he can only do it 5 minutes at a time.

1,"Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ; Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ones? \n\na)They had more volcanic eruptions in the past, which released their internal heat. \nb)They were cooler when they formed. \nc)They have relatively fewer radioactive elements. \nd)The smaller ones are farther from the Sun. \ne)They have relatively more surface area compared to their volumes. ; Of your choices, (e) is the best.  (a) is no good because it fails to account for the continuing generation of heat, as, for example, by the earth.  (b) is no good because they were all about the same temperature when they formed.  As the protoplanets grew larger, their interiors began to heat up.  (c) is no good because what matters more is density, and there's no reason to believe there are significant differences in the density of radioactive elements.  (d) is just plain false: Earth is farther from the sun than Mercury.\n\nThat leaves (e).  Surface area of a sphere is 4pr^2, where p is pi, and volume is (4/3) pr^3, so the ratio of surface area to volume varies as 1/r ... it varies inversely with radius, so the ratio for smaller planets is greater than that for larger ones.\n\nThe key connection, though, is internal <pressure>, which is a direct function of r.  Larger planets have more pressure at their centers, and that means more heat.  In fact, if the ""planet"" were big enough, it would become a star.\n\nConclusion:  Big means hot.",2680

I realized that I may not be making wise choices with mutual funds and gave $80K to Fidelity to manage while I manage the rest of my accounts with Fidelity.  This was 4 months ago.  My rollover has since lost 10k.  Is it time to dump or is this the stock market?  None of my other investments have lost this much.  This is 10 grand in 4 months...   I'm ready to call them and say ""we're done, I'll do it"" but I'm not sure if they've changed my funds to give me a better turnover whereas I've left my money in my other funds for years.  Am I missing something? ; With respect to the market in general, there's been a good-sized pullback from May to the current period.  Those stocks which have suffered most are the ones which have had the largest amount of growth (precious metals, emerging markets, etc.).  Many funds not only lost all of their gains Jan-Apr, but many actually dipped into negative YTD territory.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: is this money you have in Fidelity on a permanent downward trend or an overdue correction?  Are your losses due to the possibility that your investments at Fidelity were focused on the highest growth (and therefore most volatile and overdue for correction) funds?  What are the long-term performance records of the funds you've chosen (4 months is a drop in the bucket of time)?\n\nBasically, you can't just look at gains and losses.  You have to look specifically at the funds you've chosen, and balance them against your personal risk tolerance.  It's very likely that with the right (or wrong) combination of funds, you could have lost as much with T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Bridgeway or any number of fund families.  If you don't believe me, look at their Websites and check the fund performances.  Red ink all over the place.\n\nDon't dump funds just because they're going down or buy them just because they're going up.  How do you know you're not buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  You'll inevitably wind up buying high and selling low.  Understand why you're buying into a fund and if the circumstances that made you buy them still make sense, stick with them.  If circumstances have changed, that's the time to re-evaluate and think about selling.  Also think about selling if the assumptions you made originally were wrong.",2688

I tried formatting the hard disk but then it cannot complete reading the whole recovery disk since while reading, it automatically shuts down and restarts without completing the whole boot-up sequence. I also tried reloading original configuration in the set-up mode but to no avail. No error would appear whatsoever, a clicking sound is heard to suggest that the computer has been powered-on then shutdown (no power) and then clicking sound to suggest it is again powering up. Sometimes if lucky enough, longer powering up even reaches to display the start-up screen but sometimes is too short that clicks on and off in short durations. This is like booting and rebooting done automatically by the computer. Is this a case of hardware problem and part has most probably been damaged? This is perfectly working before but not until now no new software/hardware was installed whatsoever. Please advise. ; There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors.",2780

5,"any good baseball magazines? ; Hi all\n\nAs baseball fans, which baseball magazines will you recommend?\n\nThanks a lot ! ; This probably depends on your level of interest. \n\nSports Illustrated is my personal favorite, devoting plenty of space to baseball in season. The writing is always great. ESPN the magazine has its share of baseball material. It targets a younger audience than SI.\n\nThe Sporting News has good team reports and some features, although it is not as comprehensive as ""the good old days."" Baseball America is like the old Sporting News in that it covers the minor leagues and other baseball (draft, colleges) quite well. Some teams have specific newspapers covering just the club (Diehard for the Red Sox, Yankee magazine, Inside Pitch for the Mets, I believe, etc.) USA Today's Baseball Weekly does a pretty good overall job, although it has added other sports in the last couple of years.",2799
2,"Depression caused by cerazette? ; Anyone experienced bad side effects with this mini pill? ; Yes.  I have switched from pill to pill trying to find one that didn't make me depressed.  It happened to me every week before my period and every week after.  One moment I would be fine and the next I couldn't stop crying over trivial matters.  It did not matter what pill I was on and a lot of doctors couldn't help me, they just kept prescribing different methods of contraception.\n\nI tried Spirulina (vitamins made from Seaweed) for stress purposes and that seemed to help a bit.\n\nEventually I found a very knowledgeable lady.  Apparently (and I kbow it sounds far-fetched but its true) during certain times of the month, women retain water and the pill exacerbates this.  With the extra water, there is more pressure on the brain which sends mixed messages to it causing the emotional rollercoaster you're on.  She prescibed very mild water-tablets for me.  It helped a lot.  The reason the Spirulina seemed to work was because its also a diuretic to some extent.  However, for me it never cleared up completely so I also took Vitamin B6.\n\nNow I'm off the pill and I don't seem to be suffering like I used to.",2803

1,"What would happen if you dropped a small black hole on a planet? ; Say, about 1 -100 kg. Would it absorb the planet, or wolud it stabalize itself in the core? ; A 100 kg black hole would be incredibly small. A black hole is an object that has a density so great its escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. For a 100 kg weight to be that dense it would have to have a radius smaller than 1.48*10^-25 meter. That´s smaller than a quark. If such an absurd object could form it would still be just a 100 kilo weight. It wouldn´t suck the earth in. Immediately... Earth still weighs more. It would simply fall towards earth but when it reaches the surface it would just keep on falling as it would be too small to hit anything. It would fall straight through the core and start falling upwards until gravity would make it settle there. Eventually though some matter in the core would come so close it would be captured by it. Remember that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light to escape a black hole. So the mass of the black hole would increase with time, feeding on earth. And as its mass grows it would capture matter in an increasingly greater rate. Eventually you would have a black hole with the mass of earth (+100 kg) orbiting the sun instead of the lush, blue planet we all know and love.",3003

This said, once we do, we are usually in Peace.\n\nSecond - Not all religion promote self understanding and inner Peace. Some have very specific instructions as to what to do in certain cicrumstances when one is faced with people from other beleifs. This means that if there are radically and very picky and emotially hurt people, they can apply those aspects of their scriptures and try to make them real.\n\nThird - Most all religions sees their books as a guidance and God graces passes through it. Islam's Koran is seen as the word of Allah, thus making it difficult to say that radical Islamist muslims are not following their book\n\nFourth - Many evangelical groups also focus on the Old Testament and apply intolerant and less compassionate aspects of God. In my book Jesus came to toss that understanding of God aside, but that is another subject.\n\nFifth - The Sikhs also have a sacred book and it is seen a their Guru. However, that book is treated and respected in temples...\n\nI beleive that learning how to communicate tames physical violence and brings a better way to find common grounds to share. Why we are having so much issues is when we blob religions together thinking that they give the same message of Peace. This illusion is not helping currently and creates insecurity, misunderstandings (such as the Cartoons incident) and bigger chasm. Many people really adhere to their religion and feel threathen when it is placed as something equal to other beleifs such as science, secularism, ideological and philosophical contributions to society.\n\nSo, no, religions absolutly do not have the same basis and even Goals.",3039

7,"About Roger Taylor, the drummer of Queen...? ; Does anyone out there think that he was really hot when he was younger? Oh my gosh, he was soooo handsome back in the day, but now he's not as much. Of course, he is in his fifties now. What do you think? \n\nAlso, can anyone tell me where I could watch the American Idol episode where Queen's music was the night's spotlight? I'm not even sure if there is a website out there where I could watch it, but please tell me if you know of anywhere. Thanks so much! =) ; Roger was so hot. He was amzing, by far the most handsome of all four of Queen. When he was sitting behind his drums it was even better, how he is drumming. I like to watch the Wembley 86 DVD and then the Roger Cam :). As much Roger as possible. Now he is indeed less handsome, although he lost a lot of weight for the European tour. I've some pictures were he looks very hot again. But later in the American tour he gained weight again :(. And he looks less attractive again. Though if you have seen him in his white outfit singing these are they days of our lives, I can say he still is a very good looking guy.

5,"Mortorcycles and the NFL? ; Do you think that after what happened to Pittsberg QB Ben Roethlisberger, The NFL will start putting in the players contracts banning motorcycle riding? Do you think it is right of the NFL to do that? ; here are my vview on things:\nI'm reading through some of the comments about this situation ""I hope it's not serious"", ""gee that's too bad, we hope he'll be all right""...""he's a great player, hope he can still play""... but I can't help thinking ""what a waste.""\n\nHow many of us would love to be living a dream, to be a pro football player, making millions? This kid is already on record as the youngest QB ever to win a Superbowl, he's got his whole life and career in front of him, and he doesn't care to protect all that he has to live for?\n\nOne article I read mentions how players past and present, as well as his coach have appealed to him to reconsider his celebration of freedom in not having to wear a helmet. Fellow Americans presumably equally in support of ""freedom"" yet were also able to consider what he potentially had to lose if he should meet in an accident.\n\nAnd here we are. The article I read said ""injuries do not appear life-threatening."" Will he play again? Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye. He refuses to wear facial protection, and he's out for the first month. Duh.\n\nLike everyone else in the sports world, I join in wishing Big Ben a full recovery. I hope we get to see him continue what many are now confident must be a hall of fame career. Do I feel sorry for him? Sure...but, for crying out loud, at what point do we hold people accountable for taking unnecessary risks? Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street? If we expect kids to make smarter decisions in the interest of their own safety, why is it so easy to make excuses for ""adults""?",3085

If you want to lose weight, exercise and diet are the keys.  There's no quick fix.  If you keep eating like you are, you will keep gaining, pure and simple.\n\nIf you want to lose wight: Instead of 3 meals a day, eat 6 SMALL meals. Drop your carb and fat intake, as it is obviously too high. Cut out ALL sweets... no more deserts. Treat fast food like the plague that it is... in other words, don't do it! Drink LOTS of water, drink NO sodas. Up your activity level and get on an exercise program 5 days a week. You may not want to exercise now, but after a week of it you will find it addictive and you will have no trouble maintaining it. \n\nYou either need to change your entire life style, or forget it.

5,"Why do they bid to negotiate Japanese pitcher's? ; I don't understand why they have to negotiate to talk to Japanese pitcher's? who gets that money the player? We don't do it here when a player is a free agent. What the story on this. ; It's a system called ""posting"" that they initiated after the Dodgers signed Hideo Nomo after his ""retirement"" from Japanese baseball, and it was done to prevent MLB from poaching all the young Japanese talent.  MLB agreed to the provisions of the agreement because it keeps them from having to fight in court for the rights to Japanese players.  The NHL doesn't have any such system, which is why they could end up in the courts over players like Malkin, and that could cost them a lot of money.\n\nThe bid money goes to the Japanese team that owns the player's rights, assuming that the bidding team is able to sign the player within 30 days.  If they are unable to come to an agreement with the player, then the transfer fee is not paid.  So, if the Sox were unable to sign Matsuzaka, they wouldn't be out $50 million.  \n\nTo see a list of players who have been posted in the past, you can check out this link:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_system",3124

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

Lean forward, almost as if you're trying to look over the nose (front end) of the board. Now push down quickly with your back leg, slamming the tail into the ground, and slide the edge of your front foot up the griptape.

Oscar has the one key weapon to beat the tuck and roll style that all the Mayweathers used, the same weapon Julio Cesar Chavez used to dismantle Floyd's Uncle Roger, the left hook.\n\n      When Julio fought Roger, who Floyd fights exactly like it was the left hook that landed and hurt Roger and allowed Julio to go upstairs on Roger. Gilberto Reyes came up with the plan to attack Rogers body at all cost, no matter what Roger threw Julio was to stay on the body and keep throwing his left hook to Rogers liver for the first 5 rounds nothing but BODY, BODY, BODY. Any fighter who tries to stand there and exchange and unload bombs on Floyd's head will lose. He's way too slick for that. The body attack is key here.\n\n   Oscar is a converted Southpaw meaning when he was a little kid his father switched his left handed stance around and made him fight as a right handed fighter all Oscars power is in his left hook. Oscar knows the value of a great body shot, a perfect example would be his fight with Hopkins. Floyd Sr. knows that this is key to beating his son and jumped on the Bandwagon for a estimated 3 million dollars, so he can look like the brain trust and Architect who came up with the plan to beat Floyd when Oscar had the tools all along.\n\n     Thank you for the great question Loverly Lady Vette.",3231

I want to lose 10 lbs very quickly, what else do I need to do? ; You need to have high intensity and increase sessions to 1.5 hours here is a plan I follow. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit.  \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.",3254

1,"Why there is redshift & violetshift if planets move close or away?If wavelength changes then why? ; I understand that the redshift and violetshift is due to change in wave-length. What is my doubt is that why there is change in wavelength. Is it like wave is compressed or stretched? Is is like that, that wave has to accomodate it self between earth and corresponding planet? ; good question....its kind of complicated but basically, one type of Red Shift is similar to the doppler effect for sound. When an ambulance screams towards you the siren gets noticable higher pitched, then when it races away the pitch drops. This is because the sound waves are traveling at a fixed speed  toward your ears, but the fast movement of the ambulance is changing the frequency, or the rate at which those waves hit you. it is essentially smushing more of the sound waves together as it approaches you and stretching them out as it moves away. This same principle applies to light and all electromagnetic waves. \n\nThe other type of red shift include cosmological redshit, and gravitational or (relativistic red shift). \n\nCosmological red shift can occur as space it self expands, this expansion of space expands the actual photons and inturn drops the frequency of the light towards red. \n\nGravitational Red Shift can occur when ever light passed through a gravitational field. Gravity imposses a time dilation effect on anyting in the field and so photons are also subject to this. The result is the drop in frequency towards red. \n\n(it is also important to note that the red shift also applies to all electro magnetic waves visible or not, and in cases where the light would be infra red or already at a lower frequency than red, a red shift would actually shift that wave further away from red.)",3363

If we travel towards that star with velocity of light, the rate of information we will receive will be double.

Curious if I continue to wait what the risks might be.  My husband are trying to have a child with no luck and it is painful to make love.  We want a child desperatly but I am not sure if I can handle the pain after sex much longer.  Any suggestions? ; I have polycystic ovary syndrome, and part of that is that I have lots of little cysts on my ovaries.  The most common potentially dangerous thing that I have heard of happening with cysts is that they can burst (depending on what kind of ovarian cyst that you have).  I had this happen once.  It was extremely painful and I felt nauseous, but after a few hours I was completely fine.  Ruptured cysts almost always heal on their own, but they're painful and have a small chance of infection.  I know you want to have a child, but sometimes birth control pills help with cyst problems (also depends on what kind of cysts you have).  If you can't get your surgery scheduled any sooner, perhaps you should ask about going on the pill just until something else can be done for them.  Besides, you don't want to get pregnant just before having surgery ""down there""...odds are they wouldn't do the surgery if you were pregnant.",3560

Your body has to open up your uterus to a certain extenet to get the baby out, but when it's just your period, it opens it up only so much to let the blood flow through.

9,"After Saddam is executed, shall we next have GW Bush tried for war crimes? ; Considering that Saddam was responsible for the unwarranted deaths of perhaps 10,000 Iraqis, tops... while Bush was responsible for the unwarranted deaths of at least ten times that number of them.  Then... isn't it a shame that IF Bush could be convicted and sentenced to death -- that there's no way that he could be executed 10 times?  That would be only fitting, after all.\n\n    And... failing any of that, then the next-best thing would be to simply turn Saddam loose with our apologies and reinstate him as President of Iraq.  He then could do that which we've been ABYSMAL at:  reunify that country and re-stabilize it.  Meanwhile, his people would idolize him!  (Too bad it had to cost anywhere between 100,000 and 600,000 innocent Iraqi lives (and those of around 3,000 of our troops) for us to get to this point.) ; Graig C, I don't believe that Saddam is going to be executed. His next trials will drag on for 2 more years until next president will forgive him. Bush only hyped Saddam's execution before the election for political purposes. Bush can't be charged for mass murdering innocent people and thousands of our troops because of the patriotic act he signed. That was indeed shrewed of the neoconservatives. Yes, Saddam was a bad dictator and perhaps deserves to be killed, but he was not the worst dictator. Why is Bush picking on Saddam? USA built him up and made him bad. Rumsfeldt dealt with Saddam and supported him in the past. USA saved Saddam's butt in the past from many assassinations designed by his Shiites rebels. They gave him all the weapons and chemicals to defend himself from those Shiites rebels. Now because Saddam refused to cooperate with the USA like Qaddafi did and because we need Saddam's oil, so he is no good? What about Sudan's President Al-Bashir, who is killing innocent people left and right in Darfur? What about Libya's president, Qaddafi the horrible dictator? What about Egypt's president, Mr. Mubarak, the selfish bad dictator? What about Syria's President, Mr. Al-Assad, who is killing and jailing his opponents every day? What about Saudi Arabia King and his Sheiks, who hate Christians and oppressing outsiders (not Saudis)? Should we invade their countries and execute those dictators as well? C'mon Republicans, Is this logical? It is fine if you want to bully people around and control the oil resources in the world, but this is not the way to do it. Brutal Military Action as we are experiencing, destroying other countries and killing innocent civilians does not match our Great American Values and Morals.

1,"why are energy levels assigned negative values? ; I am refering to Bohr's theroem of hydrogen. He used a formula involving the ""Rydberg constant"". My question is why are energy levels assigned negative values  is it because the negative sign says that the energy is giving off to the surroundings? or is it because the negative sign signifying that the energy of the electron in the atom is lower than the energy of a free electron? Thanks for helping ; Negative energy can refer to several concepts:\n\n    * Negative rest energy, which corresponds to negative mass, which has many unusual physical consequences.\n    * Energy in any system below the conventionally-defined ground state. Examples are positrons under the dirac sea model of electron behavior, and the region of reduced vacuum energy associated with the Casimir effect. This type of effect typically occurs under exotic or unexpected conditions, as the definition of the ground state is usually chosen because it is the state of lowest expected energy within a system.\n    * Energy in any system below an arbitrarily defined zero level. Examples include electron potential energy within an atom under the Bohr model of atomic structure, and gravitational potential energy in Newton's model of gravity.",3884

I have seen too many reports that show the people are greatful for our intervention.  I think there is still a possibility that there are weapons hidden somewhere.",3921
2,"What to eat post gall bladder surgery.........(HELP!)? ; After just having my gall bladder removed I am finding that what ever I eat causes stomach upset and I was hoping that others who have gone down this path would share what worked for them.\n\nIt was an emergency surgery on March 9th/06. I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922

She should dig deep down inside herself and express her opinions freely and without fear of being judged.  She should comment on what she thinks about what is happening, what others did about it and whether she agrees or disagrees with what was done.  Then she should state what she would have done about it if she could do anything.  A personal commentary is written in the first person as if she is reporting the news and giving her opinion on the story.

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

All that matters is that you are right for each other for however long it lasts.  If you get along, then to heck with what your friends say or how loud they laugh.  if they are really your friends, they'll accept it and have compassion and understanding and not mock you or put you down.  To joke when you gals are alone, well jokes, alone, that's okay.  But to gossip or hurt your feelings, their not friends and never really were.\nGo with your heart and forget what others will say.

9,"Why can illegal immigrants work for less? What are all the reasons?

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

Ok over the last 6 months I lost 45lbs.  I researced the web over looking for the easy answers. But it comes back to age old news.. Nutrition and exercise.  I chose a low fat diet, much like a diabetic's diet.  Lots of fruits and vegetables, and my special touch was diet green tea made by arizona tea which has ginsing which helps promote the metabolism.  I exercised 3x a week 30 min at curves just cardio.  Believe it or not you do not have to starve, just eat healty and eat in portions, and exercise.  Eating portions I think was very important. When I started portioning my food I really realized at that point how much I had been over eating. An example.. I love spaghetti, but an acutal portion is 1 cup.  Put one cup on your plate lol and look at the difference from your normal portion.  And I thought oh god I'm still going to be hungry. Not... I added a salad, with low cal dressing and 1 slice of bread no butter only garlic.  You can balance your meal. And not be hungry.

If you think about what things you are eating that cause you to gain weight & cut back on them, as well as maintain a moderate exercise routine, you should start to shed pounds. I have lost over 150 lbs. in the last few years & did not do one minute of dieting. I eat whatever I want but I keep in mind what I am eating & have trained myself to be aware of when I am full, etc. It takes awhile to make changes that will last a lifetime but, once made habit, you will be surprised at how easy it is to maintain whatever weight you wish & still not deny yourself what you want to eat.",4241

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

Having altered your \nnormal hormonal cycles when using the Pill, you are more prone to \nsymptoms at midlife as well as potentially more serious health problems. \nThis is because the synthetic estrogens and progestins used in the \nPill can interfere with the body’s own progesterone receptors. The \nprogestins are more potent and may inhibit the product of your body’s \nown sex hormones.\n\nNeed more info?\nE-mail me!\nBlessings~\nMichelle Jones",4542

2,"I'm on a v.low fat diet due to gall bladder probs. I also have a wheat & peanut allergy and IBS. Eating out? ; I'm a little bit sick of cooking for myself :) I'm on holidays and would like to just once be able to go out to a restaurant with my partner and order something I know won't make me sick (that isn't plain boiled rice). Any ideas? ; 1. as far as your gall bladder problem, several studies have shown that fatty meals may not play as much of a role in the colicky type of pain associated with either stones or a malfunctioning gall bladder, however all the patients I treat and including myself who has what is called ""cholelithiasis"" find that certain meals will set off an attack. It is probably a good idea when you eat to have several small meals per day rather than the traditional three meals. Smaller portions throughout the day may help with your gall bladder pains.\n2. Now for your diagnosis of IBS. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion which means you must rule out other more ominous causes, ie. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis both can be detected with a colonoscopy. Additionally, you should be tested for what is called ""gluten sensitivity"" and ""celiac sprue"". There are blood tests that can shed light on these disorders such as a test called ""gliadin antibodies"". Your GI doctor may also want to take some biopsies of your colon during the colonscopy so a Pathologist can microscopically determine what type if any inflammation is going on and what the mucosal lining of the intestine looks like. Flattening of the mucosa may be indicative of some of the diseases I mentioned previously. \n3. When you go out to eat, the problem is that if you are allergic to peanuts, many times they will cook with peanut oil and there may even be remnants of peanuts or the oil in preparing your food. This can be very dangerous. I had a patient several years ago who was allergic to peanuts and ate out at McDonalds I believe and there were trace amounts of peanuts or peanut oil which threw him into anaphylactic shock; thank goodness he survived. So you have to be very very careful and let the restaurant know that you are allergic to peanuts, oils, or any by product of peanuts. \nI hope this helps you. You should speak to a Gastroenterologist and have a colonoscopy and some blood work to check for the antibodies. Gluten sensitivity usually goes hand in hand with wheat allergies. There are newer medications that will help with irritable bowel syndrome. Zelnorm is the one that comes to mind. For some reason when it first came to market it was only for women, I assume because most cases of IBS are in females, but more recent studies show that it can be effective in relieving the symptoms of IBS in men too.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",4564

It is my right to ask and yes, I'll admit it is your right to insult.\n\nI need complete sentences that anyone in general can understand. ; Bush supported a plan to allow a company in Dubai (not the UAE government) to provide security services for ports.  He did not try to ""sell the ports.""  As to why, it's probably lobbyists.  You will find that shipping companies are multi-national entities, with companies from all over the world handling the work.  For example, the port at Long Beach is run by the Hanjin corporation, which is Korean.\n\nAt some point, the world is going to have to do business with Middle Eastern companies, and maybe someone thought this was a good way to go.  However, the security of a port should be undertaken by local government, not by a commercial entity.  To bad local governments may not have the money to do so.",4613

1,"how are michelson's interferometers used ?(to calculate wavelength of light  etc)? ; can someone help it with diagrams ; A Michelson interferometer is like a very very sensitive ruler that measures in wavelengths of light. Visible light has a wavelength between about 400 and 800nm (10^-9 meters). Thus the distances we can measure are pretty small.\n\nThe basic operation of a Michelson interferometer is like this: You take a laser (because laser light is monochromatic and coherent), and then split the beam. We need the light to be monochromatic, that is, having only one wavelength present (633nm for a HeNe laser, common in the lab). Once split, the laser is put on two different paths, these should be at right angles to each other. They are then reflected back along the same path and recombined. If the distance in one leg was greater than that in the other leg, we'll see an interference pattern due to the different number of wavelenghts that fit along the different paths.\n\nSo it is an instrument for measuring differential length. The idea was that you could use this to look for the ""ether."" This was an idea in the early 20th century that there must be some medium for light waves to ""wave in."" By analogy, water waves are movements in the medium of water. So there should be (the thinking went) that there is an ether that carries light waves.\n\nWell, the way to test  this idea is to think about how the earth moves. If there was an ether the earth would be moving through it at some speed, in the direction that the earth is moving, we'd measure a different speed of light than in a direction at a right angle (orthogonal) to the motion of the earth. So you set up your Michelson interferometer, and see if you can get interference patterns that could only be due to the different speeds of light in different directions.\n\nThe experiments revealed that there was no such thing as an ether.",4633

Many of these thieves draw expenses amounting to £150,000 pa on top of their already bloated salaries of £60,000.  God only knows what government ministers are paid - something resembling a telephone number I should think.\n\nOn the whole I think the British people are let down badly by their representatives most of whom pay little or no attention what so ever to what we the people are saying, once they're elected that is - another five years on the jolly waggon at our expense.  And to cap it all, these people want us to pay for their political parties and their profligate spending.  Oh, never mind, the tax payer will foot the bill.  VOTE NO to that by the way.",4767

For $$$.\nBible edits: Over time the bible has had many chapters changed, added, omitted.\n\nhttp://flushaholybook.com ; The important things (dogma) do not change:\n+ The Church has always believed that Christ was divine\n+ The Bible has not changed since the canon was established (see below)\n\nSome traditions do change over the years as the Church is continually guided by the Holy Spirit and may continue to change:\n+ Priestly celibacy (see below)\n\nSome mistakes started by very human, incorrect, and even sometimes evil people are corrected:\n+ Indulgences for money\n\n+ The Bible + \n\nThe New Testament canon of the Catholic Bible and the Protestant Bible are the same.\n\nThe difference in the Old Testaments actually goes back to the time before and during Christ’s life. At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.\n\nThe Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities. Many of these Jews spoke only Greek.\n\nThe early Christian Church was born into this world. The Church, with its bilingual Jews and more and more Greek-speaking Gentiles, used the books of the Septuagint as its Bible. Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint. \n\nThe books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).\n\nThe Christian Church did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint.\n\n1500 years later, Protestants decided to change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon. The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.\n\nHere is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/\n\n+ The Celibate Clergy + \n\nThe celibate clergy did not come into full bloom until about 1000 A.D. There were many married priests, bishops, and popes before this time.\n\nFirst, Judeo-Christian tradition has always held that single people be celibate. This is taught by Judaism and Christianity from before the Scriptures were written down.\n\nThe question should be: Why can't priests marry?\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nA priest is ""married"" to the Church. Some people think that a priest who takes his duties seriously cannot take proper care of a wife and family. ""A man cannot ser",4992

About 3 months ago I told her (casually) that I was seeing somebody. She immediately suggested that she was coming to my town and wanted to hang out for awhile. We did. She asked how things were going with the g/f, and I told her they were ok and that we were reaching the make or break point of the relationship. I asked her if she was seeing somebody, and she hesitated (what does the hesitation mean) before saying that she had been seeing somebody for a year. I told her I was happy for her.

If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.

I live in very clean environmental conditions, and I'm the only one in my household suffering from this. \n\nThe itch lasts for about 15 minutes. Sometimes its really bad! Can someone help please??? ; It could be several things. You may need to try a soap that has no fragrance or additives in it, like Ivory. Changing soaps often isn't good to do either. You may also have ""hard"" water in your area which will leave a soap film on your skin which can cause itching. Your skin may be extra sensitive to it. Try having your water tested or get a water softener installed. Your shower water may be too hot which pulls all the natural oils from your skin, causing drying which could also be the culprit. Try taking a cooler shower. Keep in mind that it will take a few days for your skin to regain it's PH levels so the itching may continue for several more days.",5458

Certain people are angry that the "" U.S. might \nprotect its own borders, might make it harder to sneak into this country \nand, once here, to stay indefinitely. Let me see if I correctly \nunderstand the thinking behind these protests. \n\nLet's say I break into your house. Let's say that when you discover \nme in your house, you insist that I leave. But I say, ""I've made all \nthe beds and washed the dishes and did the laundry and swept the floors; \nI've done all the things you don't like to do. I'm hard-working and \nhonest (except for when I broke into your house)."" \n\nAccording to the protesters, not only must you let me stay, you must add \nme to your family's insurance plan and provide other benefits to me and \nto my family (my husband will do your yard work because he too is \nhard-working and honest, except for that breaking in part). \n\nIf you try to call the police or force me out, I will call my friends \nwho will picket your house carrying signs that proclaim my right to be \nthere.

Keep a food diary. Try to go with the old saying: Eat like Rich in the morning like middle class for lunch and poor in the evening. Fresh vegetables and fruit should be eaten before evening so not to firment in the stomach and if possible no heavy meats in the evening and if you can you last meal should be before 6 or 7 p. But one thing you need to remember your body has been through a lot it's trying to hold on to everything to stay and get health. Keep working out eat health, drink plenty of water. Diet drinks are not the best and you will do wonderfully. A use of another crutch is not what you need. Just your determination and the thought that ""no matter what my mind and body will be at it's healthest."" Watch the processed sugar intake.",5625

It is not a foul if you hit the ball away from opponent's hand, assuming you only made initial contact with the ball, and not the opponent's hand nor other body parts in the process.\n\n2. Player with ball can not push the opponent. \n\n3. Player can attempt to take the ball away from any position, assuming they only make initial contact with the ball, and don't make contact with the ball holder's hand, body, etc.\n\n4. Kicking the ball accidently results in a stoppage of play. The team that did not kick the ball gets possession.  It is not considered a personal foul.\n\n5. It is legal, thus not a foul, to throw the ball at any bodypart of the  opponent in the hopes of it going out of bounds to maintain posession.

1,"What came first, the chicken or the egg? and why? ; must be the chicken ; In nature, living things evolve through changes in their DNA. In an animal like a chicken, DNA from a male sperm cell and a female ovum meet and combine to form a zygote -- the first cell of a new baby chicken. This first cell divides innumerable times to form all of the cells of the complete animal. In any animal, every cell contains exactly the same DNA, and that DNA comes from the zygote.\n\nChickens evolved from non-chickens through small changes caused by the mixing of male and female DNA or by mutations to the DNA that produced the zygote. These changes and mutations only have an effect at the point where a new zygote is created. That is, two non-chickens mated and the DNA in their new zygote contained the mutation(s) that produced the first true chicken. That one zygote cell divided to produce the first true chicken.\n\nPrior to that first true chicken zygote, there were only non-chickens. The zygote cell is the only place where DNA mutations could produce a new animal, and the zygote cell is housed in the chicken's egg. So, the egg must have come first.",5797

It's yahweh, you slide the vowels into each letter including the W.\n\nThose who are qouting jehovah from the O.T. are using an incorrect translation. The KJV is a horrible translation  that is nowhere near the greek of the Bible. ; In the Hebrew OT, YHWH (still to close to the name of God for Hebrews to feel safe) was frequently replaced with Adonai - Hebrew for ""Lord."" (which is why the Greek NT uses Kurios - ""Lord"").  Your 13th Century monk used the vowled from Adonai with YHWH to form YaHoWaH - but in Ecclesiastical Latin 'J' and 'W' did not exist, so it became Jaehovah.\n\nMajor literary works, like the KJV, do as much to create language as to use the existing language.

Other homo-erotic acts were also performed by then private citizen George Bush because I performed one of them on him personally. \n\nI am the woman this website (bushssecretlifein84.tripod.com) speaks of that has been posted on the net nearly two years now. None of this would be the business of anyone but President Bush's little ruse to save his failed presidency by using DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] to divide Americans one from the other has to be exposed as the act of a desperate closeted homosexual man. The only crime in being GLBT is in the hiding. The President needs to come clean with the American people about his own past sexual behavior before he tries to besmirch the humanity of people in search of sincerely committing to the same bonds of matrimony he's afforded. He violated his own vows of monogamy having a homosexual affair with a long time family friend of whom his wife had no knowledge. His hypocrisy seems to know no bounds. \n\nI had planned to run for governor of Nevada without going into any of this but his planned nationally televised address to the nation makes it necessary for me to address his attempt at division in as public a way as he picked to try this Bushification of reality regarding same sex marriages.\n\nSincerely,\nLeola McConnell\nLiberal Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada\n --------------------------------------\nNow, aint this special!?",5819

1,"How astronomer measure the distance between galaxies? ; If a galaxy is 50 million light years from earth, it means it takes 50 years for light to travel from the galaxy to earth. How astronomer knows the light from a galaxy is 50 million years old? ; By the red shifts of the measurement. Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

If that is true, what must have happened to the original rocks? ; I will answer first the easy one. The oldest rocks are found in the pacific plate, the ones near the marianes trench, but their age is not 4.6 bya. Because old rocks return inside the earth through subduction zones. \nRefer to rock cycle.\nNew rocks are produce at the MOR (mid-oceanic ridges) and old ones are consumed at the subduction zones.\nThere are no very old rocks in continental crusts because they were weathered and eroded and brought to seas through rivers.\nNow about fossils. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks forms when sediments accumulates and cemented. Like lakes, and seas. Usually these place occur life. For example a leaf fall from a tree and left at the bottom of the river. Sediments pile over the leaf and thus preserved.\nIf lava piled over a life (like a leaf) the life or existence will burn and thus not preserved.\nFor fossil to occur it must be preserved.

0,"Is it superstition? ; I know someone who always says ""Bless You"" when someone sneezes.  It is as if she HAS to say it.  What is going on with that?  Is she superstitious or is that part of her religion or what? ; It's an old superstition / nicety to say something like that from the days of ignorance of illnesses and when a sneeze could be the sign of something far more serious than a cold such as bubonic plague which ravaged Europe in 1665. It was thought that God would, somehow, cure you. Naturally this belief was fostered with the fact that if it was only a cold or tickly nose then the sneezer would eventually recover so, to people at that time, saying 'Bless You' would appear to be effective.At that time it was fashionable to carry nosegays, small handkerchiefs doused in perfume or wrapped around aromatic flowers, to disguise the terrible smells in towns where there were no sewer systems and rotten stuff and excrement littered the streets. Sneezing at such filth would be quite common.\n\nHowever like all superstitions it doesn't work and is now merely regarded as a courtesy. If your friend is so obsessed that she feels that she has to say it try two things. Firstly explain that all superstition is bunkum and is based on ignorance and stupidity. not fact and secondly offer yourself as a guinea pig to prove it.

Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined comment on the case.\nHouse Democrats, accusing GOP leaders of abusing the legislative process, have asked for another vote. On the last vote Feb. 1, the bill passed by the narrowest of margins, 216-214.\nThere is ample evidence to support the fact that Neocons attack Women, the poor and the elderly at every chance. ; A Bill is introduced in one House or another, if it passes it goes on to the other House, where they either pass the same version or more likely their own version of the Bill.  As both houses have to pass the same version of the same legislation it goes into committee of members of both house's who try to work out a compromise bill.  This is usually where all sorts of things get added to the bill that may have nothing to do with the bill in order to get both sides to agree on the bill.  At this point it goes before both houses again to be passed, if both houses pass the same version of the same bill it goes on to the President, however if any changes have been made between the two houses it goes to committee again.  This is how many pet project's or as it is called Pork Barrel Spending is created.  It is the same thing as the President spoke of as Earmarking in his State of the Union Address.

I actually like Macs better. I just wondered why they are not as popular. ; I think if you looked at the percentage of Mac users who are enthusiastic about their machines, as opposed to the percentage of Windows users who are enthusiastic about their machines, you'd see a big difference in 'popularity!'  (Can ya tell I'm a Mac addict?!)  :D\n\nAnyway, the real issue goes back much farther than the other answerers suggest:  Right from the start, Apple kept tighter control over its OS and hardware technology, which was not the case for the PC world.  As a result, anybody & their dog was out there putting together hardware & software for Windows, with the freedom to do things their own way inside.  Back then more so than now, that meant much more competition (& lower prices,) but also meant that there were lots of compatibility issues with 'tricked out' PC systems.  Different peripheral vendors would do their own thing, & when you put the wrong two parts in the same machine, they would freak out the whole system.  Mac users simply didn't have that problem.  (Every now & then something would crop up, but not NEARLY to the extent that it did for the PC world.)  Still, enough users were looking primarily at the up-front savings, and lots of people did a minimum of customization, anyway.  All that allowed MS-DOS (which evolved to Windows) to build up a larger base of customers, and that momentum built on itself.\n\nIn most ways, Windows has finally (mostly) caught up with Macs in stability & usability.

Then lost the 36 lb with a job i had where i had to run and move a lot. Now two years into my waightloss Im at 202 lb and not fat anymore but i do have some waight around my belly and here and there. It seems as if the waightloss stopped completely.. any idea how can i adjust my died or exercise to burn about 10-15 more pounds? thanks fellas ; I had this same problem after I had my son, I just couldn't seem to get back those last few inches off my belly and ass. Here is what I did, and maybe it will work for you...Up your cardio by an extra 15 minutes and hit the floor for some serious sit-ups. And don't forget to modify the number of carbohydrates and sweets you are eating. Sugar (from both sweets and fruit) turns into the same thing in your body as carbs, meaning that you have to be careful with how much of that sort of stuff you are eating. Cut out all white and enriched flours and starchy products. Toss in whole grain, not just whole wheat, and lay off the potatoes, if you can't give them up competely, substitute them with sweet potatoes, they have about half the carbs. I hope this helps! Good luck!",6258

9,"Why is there no talk by the newly elected Democrats to reopen a 9/11 investigation? ; There are so may questions surrounding the official 9/11 story that I wonder why the newly elected Democrats are not promising to reopen the investigation. From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars. The victims of 9/11 have also embraced them. \n\nBelow are some links to some films that will enlighten you on the subject. \n\nWarning: if you have your mind made up that the government holds no responsibility whatsoever and if you unconditionally defend those in power despite overwhelming evidence that proves otherwise, don't bother clicking below. Your patriotism is the cheapest and weakest one possible. It is the type that never questions authority, a direct opposition to what the founding fathers urged all of us to do when they drafted the Constitution. \n\nLaugh, scoff, or give thumbs down if you are weak in this regard. \n\nIf you are strong, truly patriotic, and willing to face the truth no matter how painful, and if you have some time to spare, click the links below. Or at least add to favorites for future viewing. \n\nIf you are convinced ny viewing this evidence that suggests 9/11 needs further investigation, then urge your Congressional Reps and Senators to re-open 9/11. There are both Democrats and Republicans who have already joined in this effort. \n\nPeace and God Bless.",6306

8,"Just A Question? ; Ok, I have a few questions LOL.  Here is some background to my relationship.  I've known my boyfriend since I was 14, I'm now 21, he's never cheated on any of his past girlfriends.  My problem is this, I get extremely jealous.  His best friend is a girl, which really tears me up inside.  Her sisters are also really good friends of his.  He looks at other girls when we are out, and talks about past sexual experiences.  This past weekend he went out with some friends and was dancing with his friends sister.  This totally killed me.  Am I being over dramatic, or what.  I love him so much, and I don't want this to pull us apart, but I just can't get this feeling to go away.  Like I said, I know he won't cheat on me, but females in general just irratate me when it comes to him.  I don't know what to do.  I've talked to him about this, but I just can't seem to kick this jealousy thing.  Can anybody help me? ; This is tough.  Part of it is that you sound insecure.  You say he won't cheat but you don't seem to believe it.  Trust is hard sometimes.\n\nAll of us guys look at other girls (sorry it's true, we just don't act on it).  I wouldn't look at another girl when I'm with my girlfriend because I wouldn't want her to feel bad.  \n\nHe may like the attention of other girls because it makes him feel attractive. But he's not making you feel secure, making you feel like the only one so there is a problem.\n\nMost people do get jealous.  Try to have more trust him and believe that in yourself more that he wants to be with you.\nAs long as nothing is going on he should be allow to have girl's who are friends same as you are allowed to have guys who are friends.

5,"why don't rugby players sustain injuries like footballers.? ; In the world cup the game is stopped every ten minutes due to somebody rolling around in agony on the ground,but in Rugby, \nplayers have broken noses and teeth missing but rarely do you see a match stopped. ; Football by the very nature of the game concentrates mainly on the feet - with the speed and standard of football increased the tackles and contact to the lower part of the body will be quite hard & frequent. With rugby on the other hand most of the contact will be experienced in the upper body - the training builds up the upper body to take the hits. Probably since there is more 'flesh' (muscle & bulk) on the upper body the degree & frequency of contact that can be sustained would be greater than around the ankles & shins. \nThe rolling around bit by the footbal players is probably due to the fact that in todays football/soccer games it is that hard to score a goal due to the high level of skill, any advantage gained will be a bonus.\nWith rugby union now being a fully professional sport, increased speed & fitness combined with the large number of games being played I think injuries will be more common place. What you will notice is that due to the reasons just mentioned before, the retirement age of the rugby players will decrease, remember Paul Rendel 'The Judge' played international rugby for England in the 1980's at the age of 36 - it will be unlikely that players will represent their country at an international level at such an age in future.",6526

I ask because just to say I want to run a business is one thing and to actually do it is something else.\n\nSo I you do have the business experience and savvy and a couple of thousands to invest then check out and research the various types of franchises out there and see which one suits you. Entrepreneur magazine and others of this type should lead you in the right direction.\n\nIf you do not have ""running a business"" experience then let me recommend what a lot experts have been saying. Get into Network Marketing. The reasons being are:\n\n1- The Training - The good companies work with organization who will help you develop you knowledge in all aspects of your business and you before the product or service. This means time and energy will be invested on developing you and a person and business-owner vs pushing you to move products.  Not to say that you shouldn't be moving products, that's why you're in business. \n\n2- Developing a Network - In order to have a strong and prosperous business you need repeat business. These organizations of  business owners will help you in the developing strong networks so that your business keeps moving forward.\n\n3- Global Opportunities - No more do you have to limit your self to just you neighborhood  with the advent of the Internet you now have access to a global marketplace. The larger companies and organizations can help you in expanding you business into the international arena if the opportunity arises for you.\n\n4- Low Risk - Most companies have a low start-up investment\nwhich means that you can work it on a part-time level until you are making enough to go full-time. So you don't have to quit your job or quit school. Also the highly reputable ones have a money-back guarantee.\n\nPoints -\n1- You may of heard for people failing to succeed in this type of business most of it is attributed to  some people fail to treat it like a business. \n\n2-A business is a business and you won't get anything out of it if you don't put anything in it.\n\n3- As a very wealthy man once told me ""Check the fruit on the tree"". Be careful of who you take advice from, check the fruit on their tree. Are they where you want to be or are they even going in that direction. \n\n\nSo keep up in doing your research and the best is yet to come.\n\n\nMy recommendation is Quixtar. They're a 6-billion dollar company. I've dealt with some of the people before. Lovely people. What I like is that they have a wide variety of products and services to offer so a person is not limited to just one or two things. Also they also seem to be on the cutting edge of product technology. Let them help you get in contact with someone in your area who can help you.",6618

They believe because they broke the laws, risked being captured they have earned the right to be in America.  And, they have no right claiming to be immigrants.  Our country takes in Millions of legal immigrants every year, and the mass majority are in far worse shape than the largest group of illegals in our country, the Mexicans.  Why should someone who comes across the border illegally be able to call themselves an immigrant, when every day real immigrants are joining the millions of Americans in Poverty? ; You're right - immigration isn't the problem. It's people willing to overlook the illegal aspects of it. Our country was built on immigrants but when people come here and step on the laws and expect to get rewarded it really gets me going.",6664
2,"How long after I eat should I throw it up if I want to try bulimia for a while? ; I'm a size 12. I want to get back to an 8 (at least) and I want to try barfing to see how quickly I can drop the weight. I want to know from those who've done it before what's the best way. How do you keep your energy up and keep from passing out? \nAnd I've excersized before and I hated every second of it so you work out junkies need not reply. \nAnd I already know I'll be taking the less intelligent lazy route, but I really don't care so you need not reply with that either. It's my body and I can do what I want with it. At leasy I'm not doing crank to get skinny.\nRemember, I just want to do it for a few months and loose about 20-30 lbs. ; Bulemia is not a good way to lose weight.  Apart from the health factors,\n1. After you throw up you get hungry again quickly.  So you're right back where you started.\n2. If you don't eat you *will* have less energy and you *will* be faint.  The fact that food briefly visited your gut does not change this.\n\nPure bulemics don't tend to be thin, in my experience.  Rather the opposite.  Thin bulemics usually are anorexic, who starve themselves and then occasionally vomit when they have betrayed whatever arcane rules they have set up for ""acceptable"" food consumption.  Bulemia also tends to be obvious to your friends and family, which will set you up for a visit to the psych ward.\n\nIt's a serious mental disorder.  Not a game.",6672
0,"Is 'tongues' valid for the church today? ; I was recently in a church with some friends and people were 'praying in tongues' at the altar.  Is this real.  I studied 1 Cor. 14 and it had a lot to say about tongues.  Paul set down guidelines in fact because everyone was talking in tongues.  Is this still for today's Christians or was it just for the early church congregations.  Did the 'gifts of the Spirit' terminate somewhere in history or are they still appropriate today?  If they did terminate, when did that happen and why? ; Jesus said, these things and more will you do, because I go to the Father. . .there was no statute of limitations.  In fact, the Bible says spirituality will increase in end times.  Yes, it's valid for today.  The guidelines in Corinthians are important safeguards, but it doesn't do away with the reality of the gifts.",6674

If you are eating ANY kind of fatty foods, you are simply pouring gasoline on that fire.  Also, have they given you any other tests such as an ERCP, Endoscope, Colonoscopy, Upper GI, Lower GI or maybe even an MRI?  I just recently spent 14 days in the hospital getting regular doses of pain and nausea medication and had all of these test ran.  Luckily I do not have Pancreatitis, but I do have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which is also diet related (lack of fiber usually); also there is a disease known as Crones Disease that have the same type of symptoms.  I think that maybe you should seek medical attention from a well known Gastrointestinal specialist.  It could be more than your pancreas.",6694
0,"Bored = Afraid of Hindus or Buddhists? ; I dont fear any people of faith.  Spirituality, like someone said is entirely different.  Spiritual people's beliefs, from what ive encountered, are overwhelmingly positive and personal, as opposed to half positive, sometimes disgustingly negative.  Buddhists i think have far more sensible and positive beliefs than christians, i think eastern 'religions' are intriguing and to be learned from.  I cant say that i dont like all christians, i dont know them all, i dont like what they believe.  Dont pray for me, instead smoke a blunt for me, at least do something that accomplishes something.  If anyone cares, my belief system is very simple;  if there is a god, he will not punish me or anyone else for that matter in any way.  Beyond that big IF, i believe that i dont know, and i wont pretend to.  But i will constantly question, and never accept blindly the assertions of people who know just as little as i do.  Religion WISHES to impose its VERY conservative positions into everyones life. ; For thousands of years India has been a veritable laboratory of religion: everything imaginable has been tried out, and nothing ever has completely been rejected. India remains a predominantly Hindu country. Its ethos has evolved down the ages through its the ancient Hindu traditions, customs, philosophy and culture.  In spite of many attacks on Hinduism by varied invaders, in spite of rumors of decay and disarray, Hinduism has outlived all announcements of its impending demise. \n\nWhen religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. It is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. It is not faith, but just social idolatry. God is not like a father in a patriarchal society, who has His favorite children to whom He communicates. This idea seems rather archaic and crude. Hinduism believes in behavior than belief and  experience over authority. In the words of S. Radhakrishnan, Prophetic religion is severe, militant, uncompromising, intolerant, while mystic religions are renouncing, and peaceful. \n\nThere is no need to be afraid of world's most tolerant, religion wich never persecuted nor attcked any country in name of religion .\n\nBored?? The vast collection of Hidu philosophy is fascinating and colourfull. No one can ever be bored . \n\nIn fact it will improve your understanding of mysticism even in christianity.It is a collection of wisdom of innemerable sages are missing out a great deal.\n\nThe Hindu religious system can be divided into two major systems. The Orthodox system (called astika in Sanskrit) accepts the authority of the Vedas.\n\n1. Sankhya - founder Sage Kapila\n2. Yoga  -  Sage Patanjali\n3. Mimamsa  - Sage Vyasa / Sage Jaimini\n4. Vedanta  - Shankaracharya, Ramanuja/Chaitanya/ Madhava/Vallabha\n5. Nyaya  - Sage Gautama (not Buddha)\n6. Vaisheshika - Sage Kanda\n\nThe Heterdox (Nastika) system rejects the authority of the Vedas. This system includes Carvaka (materialism), Jainism, and Buddhism. The Carvaka system denies existence of the individual self(atman) apart from the body and rejects the notion of moksha (salvation) for the atman\n\nWisdom of Geeta is a class apart.\n\nHinduism is a religion of freedom. It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of worship. When religion becomes organized, man ceases to be free. For it is not God that is worshipped but the group or the authority that claims to speak in his name. Thus, it becomes a kind of social idolatry. Highly individualistic, Hindus have always resisted any regimentation of thought.\n\nRegarding mothermulesmeals' post:\n\n I am glad I am not one of her friends at whom she is  always preaching Jesus  !!! It only shows their maturity and her own childish ignorance.\n\nReally she takes advantage of their being tolerance in it. She seems to be blissfully ignorant how irritating it is. Or may be she does not care about it in her zeal.\n\nHow would she feel if they start telling her how immature, egoistic and narrow , is the idea that God asked everyone to follow Jesus !\n\nGod does not his favourite children. Religion is an experience. To think that any human being or institution has the monopoly of God's truth is to commit the sin of pride.",6701

And don't play the rascist cards. Aaron was a true gentleman, Ruth was flambouyant but also a good man. and neither used steroids.

Baseball has never proven beyond the shadow of a doubt that Bonds has knowingly taken any performance-enhancing drugs. Yes, most signs point to the fact that he has, but he has never failed a drug test.\n\nUnfortunately for the sport and for the fans, baseball and the players association didn't implement a careful, thorough drug testing and penalty process until very recently. So lots of records over the past decade or so that may or may not be tainted with drug use will always have an implied asterisk next to them.\n\nAlso, the truth is that cheating has been a part of the game since the beginning.

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

Thanks for any advice. ; Hey whats up dude im glad to see you stuck with the Haro and  got it, If it has the heavy gauge steel pegs you can lighten up a little bit by takin those off and trying to find lighter ones, You can also try to find an aluminum seatpost to replace the one that came on it but make sure the one on it isnt aluminum already. Haro makes their bikes heavier nowadays but they are well made and once you get to know the bike it will be much easier to manuever.

Learn to change your lifestyle and you'll be happier in the end and will end up not gaining the weight back from Drastic dieting or pills.  Once you start eating better and doing something for exercise the weight will come off --those that have more to lose will see a results faster than those that have only 5-10 lbs to lose.  For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.  No sugar, white bread, rice, fast food, processed foods, etc.  Spread them out between 6 meals a day, every 2.5 hours, this means every meal will have to be 430 calories, not bad when you break it up.

5,"Could a good Judo Black Belt hold there own grappling with a Black Belt in Jujitsu? ; I've been training in Judo and Jujitsu and found that some Judo players are really skilled on the ground.  It seems very common now for Judo players to cross train in Jujistu and to spend at least a 1/3 of the class on the matwork.  I don't know if it is the same in all regions and clubs.  I know some clubs even in my own area spend more time on matwork than other clubs.  With the popularity on MMA and jujitsu I just think the trend has been to go to more matwork and maybe the Judo players are catching up?  Or maybe the Jujistsu fighters will almost always beat the Judo guys on the ground? ; Judo is a fantastic art, in my experience a skilled judo player will have the advantage on a juijitsu trained person.\n \n However If the Judo player has no experience in practical application of Judo techniques in real life situations, or again does not know the tools of juijitsu and how to be wary of them then some of the quick applications of juijitsu groundwork may be effective. As could any technique.\n\n The only judo trained player I have seen in action was from a third world country where he had ample experience in using judo to protect his health, i do not think any juijitsu player would have stood a chance against him.\n\n In my eyes its impossible to say this stystem over this one, it is often more a case of the player. Juijitsu certainly has some technical advantages on the ground as does judo when standing\n\n however this means very little, its all very hypothetical\n if opposing players trained in each squared up, they would surely be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that each style potentially has, and do thier best to try and avoid these\n\nmat work is not very good if the judo master has just thrown you fifteen feet into a tree",7094

3,"What do you think about Ohio Wesleyan University? Is it a great school? ; what have your heard?  Is it well respected?  academically and reputation wise, etc?  What are some similar schools to compare to...\n\nI just wanna hear some opinions and insights from people. ; If you're looking for reputation rankings, you should look at the US News and World Reports annual rankings.  If, however, that doesn't mean much to you, then you're in my boat and wondering by what measure should we determine what is the best school?\n\nThe best way to judge for yourself is to visit the campus and talk to people there - formally (the public face) and informally (the face you'll get without admissions office control).  For example, talk to some students at random in the union.\n\nBeing from Ohio, I know a bit more about Ohio Wesleyan.  My POV is that, as a private school, it was not Harvard and I had the opportunity to go to Harvard.  If I was going to pay that much, I might as well have attended Harvard, so OW was off my list.  I have a tough time imagining who would attend outside of Ohio kids that had lots of money but were not bright enough to be admitted to Miami Univerisity, Oberlin, or Kenyon (back when I was searching) or OSU (today).  Maybe there is some specialization that draws people there like Oberlin draws music and arts students, but I don't know anything about it.  Basically, OW wasn't even in my list of places to consider.  Perhaps some things have changed in the last 15 years or perhaps not, but no new news has prompted me to change my opinion.  I made a point of visiting quite a few universities when I was searching in 1990.  I probably visited OWU, but I don't recall.  It had that much of an impression on me.  In the meantime, Harvard, Yale, Oberlin, Kenyon, Baldwin Wallace, Maimi U, OSU, and some schools in SE Michigan DID make an impression on me and I still wonder if some of them would have been a better choice.  As it was though, I made the decision based on finding a program that was relatively unique and that I found very attractive so that it wasn't the university, but the degree program that won me over.",7102

I know it sounds hard but unless your really really out of shape you can do these espeacilly if you start easy like 6 or eight reps then repeat 2-4 times with 30 seconds rest in between. Every other day should be fine. When this gets easy move it up 4, try to get up to 20 then you'll be looking really good. Make sure while your doing this to suck in your gut(even if you dont have one suck in your stomach) so you can shape your abs to look their best, otherwise your stomach will just look akward.

Why or why not? ; I think that the prospects of life on Mars could exist, after all water did supposedly exist once on Mars and if there was life, it would probably have been some type of a microorganism existed on life and possibly even before life existed on Earth. If science does discover that life did exist on Mars, it will be the greatest science event to occur in the history of the world. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars ; Statistically, it is very hard to believe that we (Earthliens) are along in the universe, there must be something else out there.\nAt the same time, the odds that life would develop independently on both Earth and Mars in the same solar system is pretty slim (unless life is actually not nearly as rare as we might think).\n\nThere is of course a chance that life may have developed on Mars in the past when the conditions were more suitable, but so far, we havent found anything.  Although there is the possibility, I am leaning towards no.\n\nBut think what that would mean if we discovered life outside of Earth (especially on Mars), it would be the most important discovery...ever.  If life can develop independently on two planets in the same solar system, either we are very lucky, or it the whole universe must be crawling with life (or you could throw the God factor in if you wish).",7110

2,"in what kind of a diet can a person be when they only have time to cook once a week and is low income.? ; am very low income and i work several jobs and mostly their fast food rest. i have off once a week and thats when i can cook but i just cook something fast. can some one help me ; (long but hopefully helpful!!)\nYes exactly what I was thinking: salads.  But don't just get the basic lettuce and tomato/carrot kind, to make them really healthy and make sure you get your protein and other nutrients like beta-carotenes and amino acids...add beans like garbanzo, adzuki, pinto, lima etc....whatever you like.  Add beets, carrots, tomatoes, jicama, potatoes, corn, peas, tofu, nuts of all kinds like cashews, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts.  Then make sure you get a good salad dressing that is not full of hydrogenated fats and MSG.  IN fact, avoid all that stuff if you can.  If you want to be healthy, then read ingredient lables and avoid things like hydrogenate/trans fats, MSG, food colorings, preservatives and sugar if possible.  Those will certainly decrease your health overtime.  \nHere's something else very viable for someone who only has once a week cooking time and is low income.  I feel for you girl!  I was the same while living in LA and it just about killed my spirit.  Hang in there!\n\nGoto a $dollar store or somewhere they have very cheap tupperware or those kind of disposable containers that you can use over and over until they're dead.  But a bunch.  Like 6 or 8+.  THen goto Costco or another large chain store where you can buy bulk for less $.  \nBuy salad makings, canned beans/corn/peas etc...salad dressing and look for ground turkey too. \n\nYou can then make up salads for a few days and put them in the tupperware.  Make sure you drain all  the beans and stuff of water so that they don't wilt the salad lettuce.  Don't add dressing either, it will wilt it.  Add that later.  Buy a tupperware thingy for dressing too..a small one. \n\nThen make a large turkey meatloaf or chicken soup and split it into containers for the weeks.  I know it's boring but do a different meal each week.  It's what you sometimes have to do when  you're poor.  It sucks but it's better than eating crap at a fast food place.  You know!  \n\nTry making large meals and spliting into many containers, freezing them  until ready for use.  Meatloaf, stuffed cabbage with meat and rice in tomato sauce, tuna casseroles and soup and stuff like that freezes well. Let all the food cool first.  You can also make cheap stir frys with veggies and rice and soy sauce which is cheap and goes a long way.  Just watch your salt intake.  Make sure you drink a lot of plain purified water if you can.  \n\nRecipe for meatloaf:\n\nleast one pound or more of ground turkey/beef(turkey's better and better for you). \ncan of tomato paste\ncan of tomato sauce(not flavored yet)\none large carrot cut in small bits\none large zuccini cut in small bits\none large egg\ndash of spices if you have it, at least salt though\n\nmix together well and then bake for like 30 minutes at around 350-400˚.  sooooo friggin good.  \n\nchicken soup:\n\nwhole already cooked chicken like at safeway or something like that.  cheap and good.  \nagain, two carrots cut into small bits\nzuccini into small bits\ncelery into small bits\npotatoes into small bits \netc...of whatever you like\n\nchop up chicken pieces and save a couple of bones to put in pot while cooking.  it adds flavor and minerals from the bone. \ncut up veggies add them to 5+ cups of water.  eyeball it and see if you need more.  don't add salt.  the meat is salty enough.  do that later to taste. \nsimmer that for a couple of hours.  1-2.  \nadd cilantro if you can afford to.\n\nStuffed cabbage and meat:\n\nagain take the meat either turkey or beef you bought \nboil rice-2 cups\nget a cabbage and boil it for around 1 hour until the outter leaves are soft.  be careful, extremely hot!!\ntomato sauce and spices/salt\n\nmix rice and meat and sauce into large bowl with spices\nagain, hot be careful! \n\npeel off outter leaves while being careful not to break or split.  keep them intact. \ntake some of the meat mixture and stuff into leaves and roll them up around mixture. make a bunch ",7283

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!  Generic accusations or repetition of charges that have been DIS-proven (e.g., many on the left still seem unaware of the major media recounts of Florida in early 2005 and how they showed Bush won on ANY reasonable recount method).  Are they lying?  Some perhaps.  But others are just SO convinced already (and so mad about it all!) that they are UNABLE to look at evidence that doesn't fit their convictions.\n\nI can think of TWO other reasons or contributing factors.\n\n1) Some of the examples of fraud you cite were SO baldfaced that it is a bit difficult to believe anyone would have tried them!   They SOUND like nutty conspiracy theories!  (And note that much of the media HAS refused to give much ",7490

1,"At what temperature is Chlorophyll destroyed. I can't  find a boiling point for it ... if it even has one. ; How hot do you have to heat a green leaf before it turns brown indicating  the chlorophyll is destroyed? ; Chlorophyll is a rather complex and most of all large molecule, which means that the pure substance will be a solid.   In a leaf the chlorophyll is in solution.\n\nLeaves turning brown most likely involves encymatic digestion of parts of the molecule. The core construction of chlorophyll is quite hardy - a flat system of five- or six-atom rings with a central magnesium ion held in place by nitrogen atoms pointing to it in a square. (Hemoglobine and one of the vitamins have a similar basic structure, hemoglobine with iron in the centre and the vitamin with cobalt.)\n\nYou can dry a leaf and keep the chlorophyll intact at temperatures up to 120°C without any browning effect. Such a dried leaf will remain green, unlike a wet leaf where encymatic digestion will destroy the pigment.\n\nThe leaf will turn brown at temperatures where paper also begins to turn brown - when the cellulosis of the plant cells begins to split off water. This may start around 451°F...",7538

4,"what is DD-RAM? ; answer my question plz... ; I dont know if You mean DVD-RAM\n\nA dvd is a digital video/versatile disk and RAM is Random Access Memory.\nThe DVD-RAM format is based on PD-RW (Phase-Differential) drives, and actually uses a cartridge to hold the media (just like its PD-RW predecessor). Some DVD-RAM cartridges are double sided, making them ideal for companies to use as system backup, hence DVD-RAM is usually found only in commercial applications, and most end-users won’t ever need to use or see this type of drive. The DVD-RAM standard is also supported by the DVD Forum just like the DVD-R/RW format. However, because of its use of a cartridge (limiting it’s compatibility), and the scarcity and price of the media used, DVD-RAM is a distant third when compared to the DVD+R/+RW and DVD-R/–RW technology.\n\nThe +R/+RW and –R/-RW formats are similar, and the main difference DVD+R technology has is the ability to record to multiple layers (with its new DVD+R DL format), where DVD-R can only record to one layer (not all +R drives are capable of dual layer burning, but no -R drives are). The Plextor PX-504U is an example of an external DVD+R/+RW drive capable of recording single layer discs in the +R/+RW format, but also able to read discs recorded by a DVD-R drive.",7559
4,"Delphi Indy TCP Client / Server send recive Files using latest version 10. >? ; Hi, i am new to using Indy and is trying to create a simple client server chat program and need to add file transfer to it so fare no luck with it any demo/ advice would be appreiated thank ; I've used the Indy 8 and 9.  The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

Many, many Jewish people over the last 2000 years have given their lives to the Messiah yet retained their Judaism.\n\nThe Messiah is Jewish.

But why?  Should we not celebrate the Feasts & Festivals and observe the same Fasts as He did?  Should we, as Jews, turn our backs on His heritage in order consider ourselves Christians?\n\nHowever, we should strive to live the way God intended, not the way the Rabbi's have fenced off the law and made it more of a burden then it was ever intended to be.

1,"Physics Collision and Impulse? ; Basilisk lizards can run across the top of a water surface.  With each step, a lizard first slaps its foot against the water and then pushes it down into the water rapidly enough to form an air cavity around the top of the foot.  To avoid having to pull the foot back up against the water drag in order to complete the step, the lizard withdraws the foot before water can flow into the air cavityIf the lizard is not to sink, the average upward impulse on the lizard during this full action of slap, downward push, and withdrawal must match the downward impulse due to the gravitational force.

In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part.

By the way, the same goes for liberals. I'm tired of seeing people posting links to places of strong bias.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to this. The part your missing is when Clinton got the smack layed down on him.\n\nYou see, he had the authority in 1993 but he didn't use it  (or get caught rather) until a few years later. When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this. At least, amongst the people I knew then (many of them liberals).\n\nMy view on the whole thing is to get rid of it. It's to dangerous in the hands of the executive, especially when said executive has granted himself to power to declare whether or not someone is an enemy.\n\nI don't want to see ANYONE with that power.

2,"I have anxiety and my worst symptom is naseau, is there medication to cure only this? I do not take medication ; i can handle the battle in my head its just the nausea panic attacks that kills me, i usually get them when i get overexcited and when i eat, it just feels suddenly like im going to vomit, and the room seems to close on me and i have to run to the bathroom, i dont usually throw up, but get gaggy. Please help! ; Id be curious to know whats causing the anxiety. As for the nausea, I used to get that after being dehydrated. \n  With most anxiety there is an increase in heart rate and an increase in the metabolism often with unpleasant side effects (insulin problems, nausea, dizziness from dehydration). For that Id say try a fruit drink or bottled water(non-mineral water can increase that nausea feeling). Also try to avoid anything too cold! \n  Apparantly food and anxiety dont mix with you!\n\n  As for the panic, well, Ive found that meditation can WORSEN the effect if you have trouble emptying your mind. Sit down, empty your mind, think about something pleasant with your eyes closed. Do this in the morning and at night regardless of whether you feel the need or not. The best time to meditate is when you ARENT panicing!\n\n  Create goals in your mind -Im gonna have this, Im gonna overcome that, or this job or this car or whatever. Dont leave your mind guessing. ""Its all good"" doesnt ease the restless mind.\n\n  When you meditate?-Remind yourself that its YOUR world, and every time that sun comes up its for YOU and noooobody can change that!

4,"LINUX Distrubution? ; What are the rules or laws for distributing open source applications such as Linux?  I noticed several websites that sell Linux on CD if you don't want to download the application. Do these companies have partnerships or can anyone do this? ; There are a few open source licenses, the two most common are the GNU and BSD.\n\nGNU essentially states the software has to be totally free and you have to share the source code.  Anyone can do anything they want to it as long as they share the source code.  The only expection is that you cannot sell it for a profit.  The places selling linux are not charging for linux, but charging for the medium it comes on and shipping.  If you buy it in store, you are paying for the book, packaging, medium and usually a few months of support.\n\nBSD is a little different, you are free to do what you want with it.  Anyone can take and use the source code and do anything they want with, this includes packaging the code in a software package and selling it.  You also do not have to release the source code.  Two great examples, Windows and OS X.  Windows uses a lot of BSD code for it kernel and OS X uses a ton of BSD code, as the core and more are essentially BSD.  \n\nPersonally, I think the BSD license is crap.  Companies like Microsoft and Apple are taking it, using it, selling it and giving back next to nothing to the community that they wouldn't be where they are with out.",7928
4,"Internet Explorer 7 Windows/Tabs? ; with the new ie 7, featured is the tabs that allow you to have multiple web sites open at once.  What i was wondering is: Is it possible to take one of the tabs and make an entirely new window with it, or would you have to just open another ie and then go to the web site again?  I know that completely defeats the point of the tabbed browsing, but I wanted to know. ; I'm not totally sure of what you're asking, but I'll give it a go.   We have IE7.  You open IE and your home page, for instance Yahoo, comes up immediately.  If you ""pinned open"" your Favorites list, that also comes up immediately. (Like IE6, you can either have Fav open or closed).\n\nAt this point, the tab in which Yahoo came up is not fixed.  Now, suppose you want to open Yahoo Answers, you can either (1) click on Answers and it replaces the home page in the same tab (so, at this point there is just one tab open, so it's akin to being on IE6 at this point), or (2) you can hold CTRL and then click Answers, which will open a new tab for Answers, or (3) you can click on a blue arrow next to Answers if in your Favorites, which will also open a new tab for Answers.  At this point, there is one tab open with the Yahoo home page and one tab open to Answers. \n\nYou can click and search around under the Yahoo tab without affecting the Answers tab, and vice versa.  It's essentially like having two IE's open at the same time, like you have to do in IE6.  Only it's much faster and once you get the hang of it, much much easier to get around.  For instance, you can be looking at something on a multiple page site and tab it for future viewing (it'll be in it's own tab), yet continue your browsing through that site.

The fact of the matter is that no woman wants to run for president other than hillary. The thing is, women in politics are much more scarce as the field is primarily run by males and it is hard for women to get into a position that could win them the election.\n\nThus far, due to Hillary's presidential background, she is the best woman candidate thus far and the democractic party sees this as a means to run a tough race that might get her elected.\n\nPolitical parties aren't going to vouch for anyone (nominate them for presidency) if they don't think they'll be a viable asset to the party. Typically, parties as a whole will nominate for three reasons: They're easy to use as a pawn, they'll have an easy victory with the people, or they're an all around great person. The chances of the last are rare, and its normal to nominate people that can be viewed by the U.S. Voters as a good vote. This ensures a party victory, and normally the executive office will be run more by the president's cabinet and other party officials through the president.

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use.

2,"Naproxen or Ibuprofen?  Which is better for sciatic problems? ; I am experiencing shooting pain when I move ""wrong"" but not all the time. ; Most sciatica pain responds well to self-measures.  You'll heal more quickly if you continue your usual activities but be sure to avoid the move that triggers the pain.  For pain relief, you'll have to see what works best for you.  NSAIDs such as aspirin, naproxen sodium and ibuprofen will alleviate both pain and inflammation.  Acetaminophen alleviates pain only.  But there's a limit as to how much pain these can control.  Make sure your doctor is aware of what you take, how much & how often and how effective it is.  For more severe pain that is unrelieved or inadequately relieved by NSAIDs or Tylenol, your doctor may want to prescribe an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxer, a tricyclic antidepressant or an anticonvulsant.  You can also use the hot-cold method.  When the pain starts, apply ice packs or a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a towel to the affected areas for 15-20 min. 4x a day.  After 48 hrs. apply heat (heating pad on the lowest setting, heat packs commercially sold or a heat lamp).  You can alternate hot and cold if necessary.\n\nGentle stretching for the lower back may relieve nerve root compression and make you feel better but try not to jerk or twist your back.\n\nProlonged rest will worsen your pain.  FYI:  Naprosyn (naproxen sodium) is available over-the-counter.   You don't need a prescription.  And Aleve IS naproxen.",8176

The more closely you read it the more 'goodies' for various interest groups jump out that weren't even covered in news of the debates.  \n\nAlso, what seems to be holding it up is the guest worker/amnesty discussion.\n\nWhile this discussion continues, the border remains open.

2,"Is it normal for a person who has had bells palsy  have their eyes water 3 years after? ; I have had bellspalsy in the past in fact i have had 2 bouts in the last 6 yrs. im pretty much normal now, but my last  episode was in 2003, three years ago and my eyes still water  more when i eat or drink.. does anyone know if this is normal? im tired of looking like i been crying all the time, im really a happy person . ; Hello,\n\nAs I am sure you know by now, Bell's palsy affects the VII cranial nerve.  That is the nerve that controls the facial musculature, including eye lids.  So the first question is, do you think you have a normal blinking pattern in the affected eye.  Compare it with the normal eye.  If both eyes are tearing, that is less likely due to Bell's as that is a local and thus one-sided process.  Additionally, the facial nerve carries nerve impulses to the lacrimal or tear glands, so it may be at work here, but again that would usually be a one one sided process. \n\nAs far what to do about the tears...manually blink your eye using the back of your finger at regular intervals, and especially when it feels dry.  If blinking is not a problem, or if the tearing continues, I'd see an ophthalmologist.  Hope that helps.",8574

1,"melting glass? ; Is it possible to melt a hole in glass with a normal blow torch. ; No\nNot only does the torch not get hot enough (by ""normal"" I'm assuming a propane torch) but the flame isn't concentrated enough.  Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.

5,"What do you think about shootouts and golden goals? ; It's time again! I have a love/hate relationship with shootouts. As an American sports fan, I love the high drama of the moment, but as a student of the game and one who has played it as well, it is a horrible, horrible way to decide a match. The kicker has an enormous advantage and to blame — or credit for that matter — a keeper for a loss that has already gone overtime and where perhaps all who played “left it all on the field” is not justice. The golden goal concept I like much better. It forces all to give what is left and if a mistake is made, so be it — bring out the goat horns.\n\nAll that having been said, EITHER of these ways is preferable to a REFEREE deciding a match. This bumper crop of officials working this Cup have been very marginal in my book and straining unsuccessfully to fill what I call the “Collina void.” It seems like every match I see has at least one very glaring official’s brain-fart (witness that gift-wrapped PK given to Ghana, Shevchenko’s fflop in the box that netted a similar reward, a French goal that a blind man could have seen being ruled not a goal, to name a FEW) which may eventually lead to instant replays at least in some situations. ; I agree with most of your points. I do like the golden goal rule. The problem with it, is that if a team scores in the first minute of overtime, the other team could come back and tie the game. \n\nI still like the penalties to decide the winner. I feel these days, goalies are just as good penalty blockers as the shooter is at making them.",8602

4,"What is the safest way to backup your digital photos ? ; Should I use DVD-R, external harddrives ... what will secure my photos 20 years from now when I want to look at photos of my kids growing up ? ; Here are some thoughts:\n\n1. Hard drives have a MTBF (Mean Time Before Failure) bascially this means that they will fail within a certain time or at least produce bad sectors making some of your data unrecoverable(ish). One way to try to protect data on your PC is to have a RAIDED system that means 2 or more identical drives and hardware or software replicates the software across each drive so if one drive goes down you still have your data. This does not help if the PC goes on fire or gets water damaged, you should always have a seperate backup procedure.\n\n2. DVD's are a good way of backing up your data and I would say are a more reliable way of backing up rather than Hard disks but they are limited to 4.7GB (single sided). What I do is burn a backup every week or whenever I do a big change of data but this is dependant on the old saying ""What happens if your Hard Disk died in 5 minutes would you miss any data on it"" if yes do a daily Backup. 99% of IT companies only backup there data every day so backing up every few hours is a bit extreme but again if it is critical do a backup. Buy quality DVD's!\n\n3. USB memory sticks are pretty tough bits of kit and you can give them quite a bit of grief before they fail, USB sticks use memory chips rather than magnetic media like hard disks and tend to be a little bit more robust. They can get corrupted just like any other device.\n\n4. Zip disks are a bit old hat and have the same problem as floppy disks avoid avoid avoid! Trust me I have used them and relied too much on them and lost data cos of it.\n\n5. Tape backups (DDS3/4/DAT72) have a good capacity and alot of IT companies use this type of backup but again they are suseptable to corruption similar to floppy disks if kept for any length of time as they are magnetic media, expensive to maintain.\n\n6. SD/MMC cards are similar technology to USB memory sticks as they store the data on a chip(s) but do not normally have the capacity to store alot of data (1GB?) and are very easily lost/broken as they are so small.\n\n7. Online backups are an option but most are insecure and do you want people to have access to your data/photos etc. hmmmm\n\nI suppose there is no 100% safe way of backing up your data (and keeping it safe) but I have found DVD's to be pretty good (using quality DVD's with dark ink), I use DVD-RW as my data changes alot and there is no point in me keeping the old stuff but buy high quality DVD's as cheap and nasty DVD's tend to develop problems later in life.\nI have seen alot of testing done on USB sticks and they have been found to be very tough to break.\n\nIf you are serious about the data you can buy a small fire proof safe as well.\n\nJust my opinon and experience!",8709

First the Bible alludes to Him being glorified in some sense after the resurrection.  This could mean that His appearance was somewhat different than before.  Second, the Bible also says that Jesus had been beaten nearly beyond recognition (ever seen the Passion?) perhaps after three days He was either so black and blue He was unrecognizable, or...

2,"how to lose weight? ; i am 11 years old and my weight is 40 kg ; It surprises many people how much weight they can lose in just one week if they start paying attention to exactly how they live their lives. Because most of us have such fast paced, busy lives we tend to do the things that are most convenient, but often this is not what is best for our bodies. Fast food, frozen food, and very little exercise is what is usually most convenient. Luckily, there are ways to make eating healthier and to even fit in some exercise, even if you are one of the very busy!\n\nFirst, you need to look at your diet. Sometimes the things that lead to us being over weight are things that we just take for granted or don’t even really think about. Oddly enough, the biggest culprits are not what we even have to chew we simply have to swallow! Drinks! When you are thirsty and you need to grab something quick you just go to the fridge or the soda machine and crack open that can or bottle of soda. While the soda is mildly refreshing, it’s also packed with calories. If you are drinking even two or three regular sodas per day you’ll find that you are adding anywhere from 600 to 1,000 extra calories every day. If you cut out the regular soda you’ll find that the pounds will start dropping within a couple days. Many people find that they can easily lose up to 20 pounds over the course of just a few months when they stop drinking soda, but the initial weight loss is seen the first week.

He heard a voice that was supposedly God and had someone else write it down.

They explain the actions of what middle eastern people use to do when they were idolitors and heathans by saying that they just got confused and it was really done ""this way"" by Abraham or Moses or... etc for this and that reason. They pray five times a day. One of the two I know HATES white people... and ctually hates almost everything. He says that if it is not good and he can not make it good, then hate it because that is the right thing to do. He would be an extremist I guess.

So in every case, he got the Message from the angel.\n\nThe Quran is ""The Words of God/Allah"" to Muhammad, to tell the people.\n\nYes, prayer, the one involving prostration (called ""Salat"" or ""salah"") is five times a day.

NOI take their beliefs from Bible AND Quran. Muslims, only from Quran, recognizing the Bible to have errors and The Quran doesn't. (try reading it! you'll be shocked!) If he's not NOI, then still he is wrong to hate any ""race"", please see proof of that in the Quran itself, at http://muttaqun.com/prejudice.html\n\nPlease begin with a primer on the basic beliefs of a Muslim, at http://muttaqun.com/shahada.html\n\nYou can also read the Quran online at http://muttaqun.com/quran and I highly recommend you use The Noble Quran english translation to get the best translation. The footnotes are a super big help, too, as they crossreference verses to help you see the bigger picture, i.e. to help keep it in context.\n\nFinally, you may feel more comfortable simply joining the Muttaqiyyah egroup and ask muslim sisters any questions you want, they are very open to questions there. That's at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/muttaqiyyah\n\nKeep asking questions! Islam highly encourages everyone to seek knowledge!\n\nTake care and good questions/observations/study!",8892

Don't get me wrong, I think Powell and Rice are highly qualified for the positions, but I'm guessing there are others of many other races that are equals to them.  So either they are better suited to the position (Very Likely) or Bush needed some help and decided to make himself look good while also bringing on highly qualified people (More likely).  I hate to say that, but with everything else the administation has done and the way they spin everything (They aren't the only side doing it might I add) to fit a need makes me question it.\n\nI do think for the most part things have stayed the same, excpet for Muslims which are now viewed as some sort of enemy (A great example of this is Army commercials that feature soldiers watching ""Terrorists"", all of which are wearing turbans and in deserts.\n\nOh and I think Powell quit because he couldn't sacrifice his integrity for Bush.

It's also a good way to place blame, even if she didn't write the words, she said them and to most people, whoever said the words is guilty of creating them.  We do the same thing to any other political official good or bad. For example, people giving presidents credit for speeches that they didn't write.  For speaking the way they do takes practice which is also coached, it's more and more common now.

Am I ever going to be that weight again? ; I do understand what you are going through.  You may not ever get back to that 135 pounds, but you can get closer to it.  The drugs make it harder, and menopause may have some effect.  But there are things you can do.\n\nIf you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose some weight. You may know that you need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need at least 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Be very conscious of your nutrition.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym.   I'd go the gym route at least to start, if you have never done weight training before.  Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.\n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss. \n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4. even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\n8.  Did your oncology team ever refer you to a dietician?   That may help you.   Also talk to them about your weight concerns and get their opinions.  \n\nI hope these thoughts help. You can do this. Good luck with it.",9143

9,"Is Italy a Police State? ; I lived in Italy for five years and was repeatly horrified by the brutality of the police there. Italy is a member of the EU and I am shocked that such behavoir is allowed to continue. Whenever this matter is mentioned to higher authorities in the EU they simply say that police brutality in Italy is not within their remit. If the police in the UK acted the same way there would be hell to pay. Why is it not the same in Italy? ; In Genova, Italy 2001,the government of Silvio Berlusconi imposed a veritable police state on tens of thousands of demonstrators protesting against the meetings of the heads of state of the eight leading capitalist powers (the Group of 8). On July 20, carabinieri (paramilitary national police) charged into a peaceful demonstration and as protesters scattered, they shot an “anti-globalization” demonstrator, Carlo Giuliani, in the head, rolled over him twice with a jeep and drove away. It was an execution. \n\nThat night squads of riot police broke into the Diaz school which housed many protesters and the independent media center that was sending out news of the demonstrations. The blood-stained walls recorded the horrors that took place as scores of youth were brutally clubbed and hauled off to holding pens. As they were carrying out the attack, the cops repeatedly shouted “Viva Il Duce!” (Mussolini) and “Viva Pinochet!”",9283
0,"I believe in Christianity and Evolution. Whare are your thoughts on that? ; It's not like Satan planted Fossils and such to trick us. \n\nIt's truth.\n\nA faith that requires you to close your mind in order to believe isn't much of a faith at all. \n\nThe theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth. To reject it is to deliberately embrace scientific ingorance and transmit such ignorance to our children.\n\nI believe among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator.\n\nI mean consider it. It's observation, hypothesis, and testing. That's what science is. It's not religion. Evolution is a fact. It's not a theory. An example is antibiotics. If we don't use antibiotics apropriately, bacteria become resistant. That's evolution, and evolution is a fact. To not acknowledge that is not ot acknowledge the world around you.\n\nBottom line: I completely accept and affirm the view of God as creator, but I accomadate evolution within that.\n\nYour thoughts? ; A belief in god and evolution is mainly a problem for closed-minded bible literalists...typically fundamentalists, who believe that every word in the bible is written as god intended.\n\nThe problem you face is this. If the bible isn't taken as a literal document of belief, how do you choose which bits to believe and which bits not to believe? So, is execution right or wrong...because the bible is both ""for"" and ""against"". Same for homosexuality (although not in modern terms).\n\nMost scientists I know who are christians accomodate this dilemma by using the bible as a broad belief framework - which is perfectly acceptable - and they talk about how they are able to draw their values from this position, but they keep an open mind about what science discovers and how science can help. \n\nBible literalists have a hard time trying to present their ideas without attacking science, as though science is some kind of enemy - the kind of enemy that will end up saving their lives from cancer or serious accident someday. The greatest disservice these people play in society is to present the idea to children that science is somehow seriously flawed and that nothing can ever be proven - unlike their belief system, however, which has a complete video record of god creating the earth in 6 days (sorry, that was sarcasm...something bible literalists will have a hard time understanding).\n\nTo Vangyblue below - that's the biggest pile of nonsense I've read for for at least 30 minutes.

After destroying the reactors, we would probably end the fighting.\n\nThis is similar to the 1981 bombings of that Iraqi nuclear plant by the IDF-AF (Israeli Defense Forces/Air Force). Except this time, we'll be fighting with a coalition.\n\nI am not sure if Israel should participate in this war.

Now that is priceless. Leave everyone to there own religion, just ask your questions, and let peace be with everyone. No matter who there God is, most here have genuine questions. ; It is true that Jehovah's Witnesses are not loved by everyone.\nhttp://jw-media.org/newsroom/human_rights.htm\nSome people hate Jehovah's Witnesses out of ignorance, or over some misunderstanding. A few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a Jehovah's Witness, and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire Christian religion.\n\nHowever, it seems that the majority of anti-Witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry. A few may even be motivated against their Christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things', Satan the Devil.\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:4) the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\n\nInterestingly, such ""hatred"" should be expected by true Christians in this time of the end, and it actually helps identify Jehovah's Witnesses as Christ's true disciples:\n\n(John 15:19) If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you.

However, we always only see one side of it. How is this possible? ; It turns one revolution for every orbit it makes.  This happens because of tidal locking.  Basically that means the part of the moon closest to the earth gets pulled slightly more then the further side.  This means a slight bulge forms on the moon facing earth.  This side has more mass then other part of the moon thus is ""heavier.""  The earth's gravity then pulls on the buldge more then the rest of the moon making the moon slowly slow down or speed up in its rotation until the bulge always points towards the earth, thus one side always faces us.",9441

""The magnitude of changes that are entailed in this bill -- and are largely unknown -- rival the impact of the creation of Social Security or the creation of the Medicare program,"" said Robert Rector, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation who conducted the study. Although the legislation would permit 193 million new immigrants in the next two decades, Mr. Rector estimated that it is more likely that about 103 million new immigrants actually would arrive in the next 20 years. ; Latinos will be the majority in the US in 20-25 years!\n\nWhat then?

Everything will be in Spanish, then English, the dollar will be incredibly LOW (look at Mexico today - look at ANY hispanic country today)...  Civil war???  Maybe...  \n\nLook at what happened to countries in Europe.  Most recently - Yugoslavia.  Quick history lesson for those that don't know, might bring a wierd, yet possible new perspective to this thing.  One that could happen.  Got me thinking anyway.  I would hate for something like this to happen:  I was in Kosovo during that whole war (and stuff leading up to it).  The whole deal was over ethnic Albanians that came to live and settle, then over-populate the southern area of Serbia (Yugoslavia).  Within 30-40 years, they completely re-populated the region (10 to 1 ratio of Albanians to Serbs), took jobs, changed the language, changed the religion, lowered living standards (dirty streets, neighborhoods, more crime).  Pissed off the Serbs something fierce!  Granted, what they did under SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC (that sick bastard) was disgusting, by deciding to ""ethnically cleanse"" the area - BUT it just goes to show how a MADMAN could rile up what the local people who were frustrated TRULY felt about being having their country essentially ""taken over.""  MILOSEVIC just played on their frustrations and nationalism to the Nth degree.  Then took the still somewhat communist style army and started whacking away at the Albanians in Kosovo.  It was pretty grim.  I'd hate to see our country ever delve into such dire territory.  YET IT IS NOT COMLETELY UNIMAGINABLE.  HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS HAVE YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW HAD ABOUT WANTING THEM ALL TO JUST GO BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM, ya know?\n\nBad stuff.  Anyways, I'm not saying some ignorant crap like they should all go back to where they came from - casue we're all essentially related to immigrants.  Yet we have to examine what we can handle in this country.  Our principles that our forefathers read as they came to the US fresh off the boats from Europe of ""Give us your poor, etc.."" should be held near and dear to us as principles, but REALITY needs to kkep us in check.  How much more can we afford right now?  ESPECIALLY when old G.W. is spending BAZILLIONS on the war!  We're sorta bankrupt right now.  We need to close the doors, lock 'em, fix up our own house, ask our friends that want to visit (prospective immigrants) to wait a little longer while we clean our house up for guests, then maybe let some more in.  We should let them in on an equal basis, too.  Right now we have WAY TOO FREAKIN MANY MEXICANS (and CENTRAL AMERCIANS are quickly climbing the ranks)  Where are the CANADIANS?  Seriously?  Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the country (and ballooned to that number in record time).  We need to balance the books as far as immigrants go.  How about from the EUROPEAN continent - any takers?  ASIA?  AUSTRALIA?  ANTARCTICA (I heard it's pretty cold there)?  SOUTH AMERICA?  Once we even out our supposed ""melting pot"", then we can re-examine letting in some more MEXICANS.  \n\nWE NEED A GREAT WALL, NOW!!!  Vicente Fox (Mexican President) said he will SUE the US if we start to violate the rights of his people who are illegally crossing the border (that he knows about and is obviously complicit in).  This was spuured by Bush's recent decision to put National Gaurd troops at the US border as a stop-gap measure (hopefully just temporary until we get a ton of new border agents).  Dude will SUE us???  Gimme a break!  ASS!  Then he said he might start sending his troops to the border to make sure we are not hurting his people.

The problem with my theory is that the main idea of Hypothyroidism is that it slows your metablism (as the thyroid's perpose is to release hormones that regulate the metabilism) and I'm not fat. I'm actualy below my recomended weight and the average for my age and height. Does this mean I have no chance of being diagnosed with Hypothoroidism? ; Ok, I'm a little confused by your question, do you think you have hyperthyroidism or hypothyriodism?  You said hypothyriodism more times so  I'm gonna just assume you only mis-typed your question title.  I get the two confused all the time but hyperthyroidism means your thyroid makes too much thyroid hormone and hypothyroid means it makes not enough.\n\nThe answer to your question is yes, a young thin person can have hypothyroidism.  I should know, I was recently diagnosed and I am also young and thin.  \n\nThe pediatrition won't laugh at you, he or she will talk to you about your symptoms and if they think you might have a thyroid problem then they'll do a blood test.  If you do have it, they'll probably put you on medication.\n\nAs I understand it, hypothyroidism isn't that big of a deal, it's easily treatable with medication and the medication doesn't have any side effects or anything like that.\n\nIf your mom refuses to believe you and won't make you an appointment to test for hypothyroidism, tell her you want to see a doctor to figure out what's causing the chills and twitching.  \n\nHope that helps!",9850

5,"Tough Choice: Caddy or Addai? ; I'm in a tough situation. I can only start 2 RB's, and i have Ronnie Brown, Joseph Addai, and Cadillac Williams. \nI drafted Caddy with my #1 Pick, but he's played very poorly. Addai has found the end zone the last few weeks, and has outscored Caddy. \n\nWho should i start between Caddy and Addai? (I know i'm starting Brown) ; So easy. I'd go with a trade. Addai is stuck in a Manning offense, and Cadillac stinks this year (sophomore slump). Trade Either of them for someone sorta like LT or LJ. May I suggest Mike Alstott?\n#1denverfan",9917

And especially not Judging others - at all. Matt.7:1-... and we can never take all the logs out of our own lives. This would take a lifetime.

2,"Unilateral kidney hydronephrosis? ; I am 26 years old and have a history of kidney problems including stones and unilateral hydronephrosis due to a narrowing/blockage of my right ureter.

This morning I urinated and passed strings of bright red blood in my urine....does anyone know why this might have occured. I had a microscopic urine analysis done about 4 days ago and no infection of bladder/kidney or urinary tract. ; Is your ureter narrowing or blocked again?  Strictures or inflamation in the ureter, due to a kidney stone even, could cause the blood in the urine.  You mentioned you're having a cysto in a week; I wouldn't wait.

2,"detox diet?? ; Has anyone heard of a detox diet? If so what are some of your views on it? ; Right now there are several diets being called the detox diet, so I am not sure if you mean the one with maple syrup or not.\nIf it is the one with maple syrup---forget it. It's not healthy.\n\nYou are much better off visiting your local health food store (or GNC or Costco) . On their shelves you will see several variations of detoxing diets. There is one where you take 2 capsules a night for 30 nights. It's a slow detox but it does work. There is also one that works over 14 days.\n\nIf you are new at detoxing you will find yourself with very unpleasant side effects. Like: flu symptoms, coughing, fever, tiredness, being cranky, dizzy and several more. \n\nThat is why the slow detox is best to start out with. It slowly detoxes the system so you don't notice the side effects.\n\nOnce you detox slowly, then you can detox more agressively.\n\nThe first time I detoxed, I started with the 30 days, then went to the 14 days, now when I do a 2 day fast/detox there are no unpleasant side effects.",9949
