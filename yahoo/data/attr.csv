5,"Where does the term Grid Iron originate and how did it get applied to a football field.? ; What is the original meaning of gridiron. Who applied it to a football field and why? ; Hi there...\n\nHere is the answer I found from the Word Detective site:\n\nThe use of ""gridiron"" as a metaphor for the football field, and, by extension, to the game itself, dates back to 1897. The original ""gridirons"" were just that: grids made of iron, used to cook fish or meat over an open fire. Early on in the history of football, someone in the cheap seats high in the stadium must have noticed that the parallel yardlines marking the field resembled a ""gridiron,"" and so the metaphor was born. The first use of this sense of ""gridiron"" in print came in an account of the annual Harvard-Yale game carried in the Boston Herald.",0

5,"I need thoughts on a volquartsen stainless receiver vs, aluminum receiver.? ; I am considering purchasing a volquartsen ultra light. Then i found the super ultra light with the aluminum receiver. Does anybody know the differance between the two. Will the aluminum one hold up? Thanks ; Volquartsen makes a good receiver, regardless of what metal it's made of. If you're shooting off a bench, then it matters very little how heavy the receiver is. Get the stainless in that case; it's less expensive and will last longer. Of course, ""longer"" is measured in tens of thousands of rounds.\n\nBy the way, make sure you get the threaded receiver and marry it to a threaded barrel if you're talking about a 10/22 receiver. The original 10/22 is held together with this wedge that pulls the barrel into the receiver, but it's not a great fit. Threaded barrels take care of any slop and really improve your accuracy.",15

9,"Can anyone tell me the address...? ; to reach the Dixie Chicks by? This is a serious question, so please don't post whether or not you support them about their comments on Bush. All I need is the address. Thank you! ; Hello,\n\nI was not able to find an actual address, but I did find their website where you can sign up for their mailing list and I did find this information as well:\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have very recently changed management.  I do not yet have a new address for fan mail.  Once one is available, I will post it here immediately.\n\n \n\nBoth the old Nashville P.O. box address for ""Senior Management"" and the Beverly Hills address for ""The Firm"" are no longer good.  And of course, the Dallas addresses found in the Wide Open Spaces liner notes and some old fan club materials have been shut down for years.  Mail sent to any of those addresses will be returned to you.\n\n \n\nWriting to or calling the Chicks or their management is not likely to increase your chances of meeting them.  In fact, they will probably never see it.\n\n \n\nIf you believe that you are the first person to write to them and tell them that you are their “biggest fan,” and that they have changed your life, you are kidding yourself.  They get thousands of fan letters per week, and they all sound alike.  So if you still can’t resist the urge to write to them, at least strive for a little originality.  Unfortunately, they will probably never see it.  But if by some slim chance they do, you are much more likely to be remembered if you have something unique to say.\n\n \n\nThe Dixie Chicks do not answer their fan mail.  They are only human, and they simply do not have time to read or reply to thousands of letters per week.  Not even mail from their “biggest fan.”   But their office personnel will sometimes send photographs to fans that request them.  Your best chance of a reply is if you include a stamped and self-addressed 8x10 envelope with your request.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps you....................................................  :-O",35

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",48

Sometimes it can even ban sites without SysOp permission. Even if you *do* find one, it will probably only work for about a week. What's more, not all blockers are created equal.

5,"How to fix hand calisus/rips from gymnastic bars? ; I do gymnastics bars and I come home from gymnastics with my hands ripped up with white calisus! I do bars once a week, and my hands stay sore all week. It's not severe enough to go to a doctor, but something needs to be done to it! I purchased grips (leather things you put on your hands to help you slide) but they are too big right now. I use chalk, but it doesn't work very well. Any remedys? Water soaking strategies? HELP!!!! Anything! ; First, when not in the gym, keep your hands clean.  Calisuses that split open can become infected.  My hands were rough and calused from rowing each morning along the river.  The wooden oar would pull and pull.  In college, the horse and bar both pulled at my hands at the base of my fingers.  As a rock climber, my hands become scraped now and then.  Avoiding infection is top priority because it will stop your routine dramatically.\n \n Second, you develop a calus because of friction that is ""cooking"" your skin into a tougher, flat pad.  This friction is almost unavoidable, because it's also what gives you grip.  A bit more chalk may allow for some slip, but of couse don't lose your grip.\n\n That said, you may simply need to give your hands some time to heal.  Like a pair of shoes, your skin will adjust to the wear they encounter.  If you want to see the most incredible example of this, ask a commercial sailor/fisherman.  Their hands are like gnarled rocks.  If possible, just wait an extra day and do a workout that doesn't involve hands.  When not on the bar, I went diving or did floor routines.  It's not the same, but it'll give you a nice workout while you wait.",66

One, mass 80 kg, pushes the other and, according to Newton, is simultaneously pushed back in the opposite direction while the other, mass 50 kg, goes flying off across the ice at 4 m/s. This is a closed system, right? So where did that 200 kilogram meters per second of momentum imparted to the lighter skater come from? Yikes! Could the heavier skater have acquired the SAME momentum in the opposite direction? Is it possible that, after all this time since Newton, momentum is STILL conserved? Does MV = mv, where M is the mass of the heavier skater, V the velocity of the heavier skater, m the mass of the lighter skater, and v the velocity of the lighter skater? Does (80) V = (50) (4)? Does V = 2.5 meters per second? Nah! Lard butt's extra mass caused their skates to dig into the ice, and created enough friction to slow them down to 0.0025 meters per second... probably.",70

I don't remember his GPA, but it was like mine, somewhere above a 3.5 (but not a 3.97 - my mum set the bar WAY high.)\n\nThey both pointed out a couple of advantages and disadvantages to going back so late - one advantage I remember my mum and dad both mentioning was that when they did get placed in a job, they were able to start at slightly higher pay rates and were placed into supervisory positions fairly quickly due to other experience (ie, my dad did 18 years in the military and had been trained in management techniques which transferred over, etc).  A disadvantage I remember them discussing was that you have a harder time forming study groups and such while you're in class, because a lot of younger students aren't that responsible, although by med school I bet a lot of that's eliminated.\n\nGood luck, you're going to stress over tests, practicals, and clinicals, but don't stress too much, I'm sure you'll do fine.

0,"Holy Numbers...? ; Are 11, 7, 9 and holy numbers? ; There is only one Holy Number Known as Divine Proportion or Phi\nPhi ( = 1.618033988749895... ), most often pronounced fi like ""fly,"" is simply an irrational number like pi ( p = 3.14159265358979... ), but one with many unusual mathematical properties.  Unlike pi, which is a transcendental number, phi is the solution to a quadratic equation.\nPhi is the basis for the Golden Section, Ratio or Mean\n\nThe ratio, or proportion, determined by Phi (1.618 ...) was known to the Greeks as the ""dividing a line in the extreme and mean ratio"" and to Renaissance artists as the ""Divine Proportion""  It is also called the Golden Section, Golden Ratio and the Golden Mean.\nCircle with a diameter of 1 and circumference of piPhi, like Pi, is a ratio defined by a geometric construction\n\nJust as pi (p) is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, phi () is simply the ratio of the line segments that result when a line is divided in one very special and unique way.\nDivide a line so that:\n\nSectioning a line to form the Golden Section\n\nthe ratio of the length of the entire line (A)\nto the length of larger line segment (B)\n\nis the same as\n\nthe ratio of the length of the larger line segment (B)\nto the length of the smaller line segment (C).\n \nThis happens only at the point where:\n\nA is 1.618 ... times B and B is 1.618 ... times C.\n\nAlternatively, C is 0.618... of B and B is 0.618... of A.\n\nPhi with an upper case ""P"" is 1.618 0339 887 ..., while phi with a lower case ""p"" is 0.6180339887, the reciprocal of Phi and also Phi minus 1.\n\nWhat makes phi even more unusual is that it can be derived in many ways and shows up in relationships throughout the universe.\nPhi can be derived through:\n\n    *      A numerical series discovered by Leonardo Fibonacci\n    *      Mathematics\n    *      Geometry\n\nPhi appears in:\n\n    *      The proportions of the human body\n    *      The proportions of many other animals\n    *      Plants\n    *      DNA\n    *      The solar system\n    *      Art and architecture\n    *      Music\n    *      Population growth\n    *      The stock market\n    *      The Bible and in theology\nPhi in the Bible: Although perhaps not immediately obvious, phi and the golden section also appear in the Bible.  Also see the Theology page.\nThe Ark of the Covenant is a Golden Rectangle\nIn Exodus 25:10, God commands Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant, in which to hold His Covenant with the Israelites, the Ten Commandments, saying,\n    ""Have them make a chest of acacia wood-\n    two and a half cubits long,\n    a cubit and a half wide,\n    and a cubit and a half high.""\n\nThe ratio of 2.5 to 1.5 is 1.666..., which is as close to phi (1.618 ...) as you can come with such simple numbers and is certainly not visibly different to the eye.  The Ark of the Covenant is thus constructed using the Golden Section, or Divine Proportion.  This ratio is also the same as 5 to 3, numbers from the Fibonacci series.\n\nNote:  A cubit is the measure of the forearm below the elbow.\nNoah's Ark uses a Golden Rectangle\n\nIn Genesis 6:15, God commands Noah to build an ark saying,\n    ""And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.""\n\nThus the end of the ark, at 50 by 30 cubits, is also in the ratio of 5 to 3, or 1.666..., again a close approximation of phi not visibly different to the naked eye.  Noah's ark was built in the same proportion as ten arks of the covenant placed side by side.\n\n\nNoah's Ark\nThe Number 666 is related to Phi\nThe relationship of phi and 666\nRevelation 13:18 says the following:\n    ""This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is a man's number. His number is 666.""\nThis beast, regarded by some as the Anti-Chri",117

I have read that it isn't always effective? ..Taking into consideration factors like weight of ammo you can carry, range,recoil,accuracy,and effectiveness against hostiles,vehicles and buildings would you prefer something else? Maybe the 7.62x39 or what about the new 6.8 Special Purpose Cartridge? Any news on how this last cartridge is performing in action? Maybe they have finally found the right balance of cartridge size and effectiveness? ; Unhappy.\nHowever there are many different and important factors to keep in mind. The 556 is a small round. Its actually a 22 caliber round.  It is very light weight. Much less then the 7.62x51 (308 winchester). However the 556 is meant to be fired at full auto. The 7.62x51 (by which i will refer to as the 308) is much heavier much more powerful and has too much recoil for full auto. The 308 is still used as a sniper round, even though several others are much better, such as 30-06, or several other (e-mail me and i will tell you why they use the 308) and the 308 is the ammo used for the M240 light machine gun. the 208 is the perfect round for the light machine gun. Say any different and my brother will mix words with you. \nWhatever the government says, the 556 was designed to penetrate soviet body armor. It mushrooms when passing through body armor and actaully has more shock value (due to increased surface area) despite going through the armor. It takes too many hits to take down an opponet and wastes too much ammo. Its really a shame, because there are civial loads of 556 (teachnically 223, because they are on the civilan market) that have much heavier bullets and have far greater stopping power.\n\nthe 6.8 is too dangerous.  Say you are a Marine Force Reacon guy, or Amry Ranger and you are shooting these great 6.8 bullets and killing every enemy. No problem, right? But wait.... You have run out of ammo. you can not resupply from friendly troops, and no one has 6.8 anywhere. You are screwed.  \n\n6.8 is battering M16's to death too. its way too powerful for the gas operating systems and the recievers.\nIf we had new guns built to stronger tolerances then 6.8 would really be great.",140

1,"Is there a thing called as God?I believe there a scientific explanation of everything.? ; There are no evidences and everything in world has a scientific explaination but everyone says there is God.But there really isnt and everybody wants a support and so they create an imaginary thing called as God. ; This was written as a personal email so it won't read very well.. \n\nI know you believe in science and love science. I believe in science\nand love science. And for both of us it is beyond science. It is the\npower and the beauty and the generosity and the love of nature, mother\nearth, and this world we inhabit. We believe in the gift of life given\nto us in the air we breathe, in the purity of water that purges our\nbody of toxins, in the energy of fire that gives us warmth and guides\nus in darkness, in the fascinating complexity of soil which enables\ngrasses and bushes and trees to grow and provide sustenance to the\nliving. Am I in awe of nature? It never ceases to amaze me and make me\nfeel grateful for its bounties.\n\nDo I feel the presence of God in nature? I do.  Do I believe that God\ncreated everything as a master planner or a designer who had every bit\nand every piece in his mind and who had the power to create the\nuniverse with everything that inhabits it? I don't. I believe that\nthere was a big bang in the universe. That everything was created from\na single source of matter and energy. That before the big bang time\nstood still. There was no space. There was no gravity. There was no\ntime! That there was carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen and\nphosphorous after that amazing event and everything that we see around\nus and we know exists around us has come to us from these elements.\nJust like a baby in the womb starts off that single cell. And from the\nmother's body it draws food and air and grows into a wonderful living\nbreathing beautiful child. Do I believe we evolved from apes? Yes I\ndo. Do I believe that there is lightning when static electricity gets\ndischarged into the Earth? Yes I Do. And I laugh at the Hindu belief\nthat Lord Indra wields the power of lightning and rain in his hands. I\nlaugh without fear or shame that I am rebuking God.\nSo what is God for me now. I say 'now' because I also have prayed in\ndesperation to God for help or forgiveness. But I have rejected the\nidea that God is an entity who will judge me for my actions, who will\nreward me or punish me for my karma. I believe I will receive my due\nfrom the society, from my family and my friends and every life I\naffect and every life that effects my in any way. While I am alive.\nAnd when I die I will become one with the earth or water or fire or\nair. I don't care which. So who is God for me? God for me is the\nbeauty of life. The happiness that beauty brings us can never be\ndescribed by or encompassed by Science. It is God that makes me smile\nwhen a bird picks up a worm and puts it in a little bird's hungry\nbeak. Will I be able to ever explain it by science? Never! The poor\nworm died. But still there is such a power in the act of a mother\nfeeding its baby that the death of a worm is joyous. The beauty of a\nflower blooming. When I was a kid I used to sit in front of the\nevening Lily plant and watch its petals open one by one. Love and\nBeauty and the Joy they bring to us are God to me. Then God is within\nus and it is outside us. God has always existed ever since any living\nthing has existed. God is everywhere. And it is the knowledge itself.\nAnd it has the power to move every person who has God in his heart. An\nOmnipresent, Omniscient, Omnipotent entity. That is the definition of\nGod I feel all religions lead to. Our capacity to experience love, joy\nand beauty is God to me.\nJesus was the son of God. He did not walk on water. I will never\naccept that. Krishna was the son of God. He did not have the power to\ndisplay his stupendous universal form to Arjuna in the battlefield and\nmake him see the entire universe present inside his mouth. I will\nnever believe that there were events that happened as literally as\nthat. No miracles, no magic, no superhuman powers, no healing of the\nill and no decimation of the devils. Jesus loved humanity. His love\nempowered him to amazing peaks",153

Thanks alot. =) ; Bio Magnetics, treatment for the human body using magnetic therapy, was first recorded by the Chinese in circa 3000 BC. It is found in most civilizations throughout human history around the world. BioMagnets have been found to help relieve Carpal Tunnel, Tendonitis, Toothache, Headache, Backache, Arthritis, knee, (or other joint) injuries, sore or knotted muscles. \n\nBy using a proper magnetic field, the electrical condition of the specific problem area of the body can be manipulated into a healing attitude. Forcing the electro-bio-chemical activity of the cells to assume a high-energy, healthy circuiting, Biomagnetics can help the body return to proper health known as Homeostasis.\n\nMost manufacturers advertise their magnets’ internal gauss ratings instead of their surface gauss ratings. However, the actual gauss at the skin’s surface is much lower than the internal gauss rating. So, in our example above, a magnet rated at 45,000 internal gauss may have a surface strength of only 2,200 gauss.\n\nThe penetration of a biomagnet’s field is dependent on both its gauss and size: Length, width, and depth. So, the field penetration of a small biomagnet with a high gauss rating may equal that of a much larger magnet with a low gauss rating. The earth’s ½ gauss field extends far because of the earth’s large size.\nMore power = more energy = more depth of penetration.\n\nFor more info click the links below.\n\nThat's My Best Answer!

In about the next hour, I had landed about 25 pounds worth of bass in 5 fish.  \n\nI've fished plenty of tournaments, and I would have killed to have been in one that day, but as they say, ______ happens.\n\nMeanwhile, spinnerbait boy is over there in the corner w/ no bites at all.

""I missed it, I'll get him again.""\n\nThree or four more times, the bite is in the same place, and he keeps missing it.  (I'm starting to think it's a log, weeds, rock, etc. but I didn't say anything)  On the next cast, he got to the spot where he had been getting a ""bite"" and set the hook violently.  He fought and fought and fought and said he had a big one.  ""Get the camera, this one is going to be a good one""  <== Exact words.  \n\nWell when the monster surfaced, it was about a 4 ft. stick.

It's your job as a parent to teach them the rights and wrongs. Christian or not. Better to teach them about safe sex than having them come up to you to tell you that they are pregnant out of wedlock with a guy that they just met or, worse, that they contracted STDs, HIV or AIDS!!! Talk to them and inform them. Best wishes and take care.",179

9,"Copyright infringement question re online image? ; A friend of mine in Southern California has a small business (hypnotherapy) and, some time ago, asked a web designer to design a website for him. He did so. A year later, my friend got a letter from Getty Images saying, in a nutshell, that he owes them $1000 because he has a copyrighted image on his website. There was no prior cease-and-desist letter, though they apparently knew he started using the picture a year ago. He called the web designer, who said that he grabbed the image off a free-image website via a Google search (he can no longer locate that particular website), and that the image has no copyright imprint on it. He's not sure what to do and has until Dec. 1 to pay, oer Getty Images' demand letter. Anyone know what he should do? Your advice would be greatly appreciated. ; Advice: Get an attorney.\nThis really depends upon any contract he had with the website developer.  There could be an argument that, in absence of a ""work for hire"" agreement, that the webdesigner owns the copyright on the website, and your friend's business shouldn't be sued.  Certainly, there's an argument that the web designer has to indemnify your friend (i.e. pay for any damages) for his own intentional actions -- like copyright infringement.\n(P.S. an image does not necessarily have to have a copyright imprint on it to be copyrighted.  This may raise the issue of ""innocent"" infringement, which may lower statutory damages, but probably will not change the analysis much in this instance, where there is a definite market for the images.)  \nSo, have your friend get a lawyer; and if he cannot get a lawyer by December 1, have him write back and say that he is in the process of getting an attorney who will get back to him by _____. Although attorneys often send demand letters with fast deadlines, they usually (read: USUALLY) do not take further legal action right away if they receive some response (because it's always cheaper to settle these issues than it is to file suit and litigate).\nIf your friend cannot afford an attorney, just make sure he keeps in contact with the other side. These sorts of disputes are rarely settled for the first demand.  (Your friend can consider a counteroffer based on the use of the image, or agree to pay a much smaller license fee and remove the image, for example.) Your friend also needs to forward this to the web designer to put him on notice that the web designer may be on the hook to indemnify for these damages.\nGet an attorney.",191

Tull was educated at Oxford, England where studied law, he later studied agriculture during his travels across Europe. Jethro Tull inherited land in the southern part of England where he put into practice his study of agriculture. \nHis seed drill would sow seed in uniform rows and cover up the seed in the rows. Up to that point, sowing seeds was done by hand by scattering seeds on the ground. Tull considered this method wasteful since many seeds did not take root. The first prototype seed drill was built from the foot pedals of Jethro Tull's local church organ. \n\nJethro Tull was part of a group of farmers who founded the Norfolk system, an early attempt to apply science to farming. In 1731, Jethro Tull published ""The New Horse Houghing Husbandry: or, an Essay on the Principles of Tillage and Vegetation"".",201

1,"How does consuming alcohol affect ones body temperature, particularly in cold conditions? ; I am a bicycle messenger in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. Tommorow the temperature is supposed to be -30 Celsius. Also it will snow and be a slow day. So to keep warm is it really a good idea to take a flask of scotch on route?\nWhat would be the best alternatives as far as diet is concerned for maximum heat? ; Contrary to what is believed, alcohol may make you feel warmer but it actually lowers the temperature of the body. When alcohol enters the blood, it causes the blood vessels to widen.  More blood flows to the skin's surface.  The drinker's body temperature drops as the increased blood flow to the surface allows body heat to escape.  People who drink alcohol in cold weather to get warm actually accomplish the opposite.\n\nThough carbohydrates are known to be the best source of heat and energy, all what you eat are actually contributing in producing your body heat. So eat a well balanced diet and wear sufficient clothing to combat coldness while you go out. Instead of bringing a flask of scotch on route why not bring a flask of hot drinks instead?☺",207

The warrant must describe the person wanted pretty clearly like height, weight, hair, eye colors, and will have identifying numbers to Id's as well.

7,"Who do you like best, Gaara or Sasuke? Why? ; I like Gaara because he is just so cool. ; I like Gaara better than Sasuke because:\n\n1. Gaara has cooler hair. He's a redhead (which is totally cool), and Sasuke's hair looks like a cockatoo.\n\n2. Gaara crushes people with sand. This is cooler than fire because he can make armor out of it. Can you do that with grand fire ball release or chidori? I think not.\n\n3. Gaara has the tragic past factor. Yes, I know, Sasuke's brother killed off his entire clan, but he did it himself. Gaara's dad made other people, including Yashamaru try to kill Gaara for him, so that just makes him a skank and Gaara's past more tragic.\n\n4. Gaara makes his older sibblings fear him. This I can respect because I wish I could make my younger sibblings fear me the way Gaara does to his.\n\n5. He has an inner demon. Come on. Don't we all? In Gaara's case, this just shows what happens when we let other people see our inner demons.\n\n6. He has a tatoo. What else is there to say?\n\n7. He gets killed and then revived.

9,"How could I succeed in my ezaminations? ; In Law studies. ; I don't agree that just reading cases is effective in the study of law. Memorization won't help you in the long run.\n\nThe point of having law students read cases (and the point that often gets overlooked) is that the value is in learning how to digest and understand the material. Briefing the case let you practice how to quickly go through a case, and pull out the important statements of law. That's the same thing you are going to have to do as an attorney, when researching appropriate legal precedent.\n\nYes, the facts of the case also help form an association to assist us in remembering the rule. Anyone who has taken Remedies will probably remember the egg-washing-machine case. \n\nBut the point of the learning process is to understand the general concepts and to learn how synthesize simple rule statements from complex holdings. The other part is to be able to understand why certain fact patterns trigger the application of certain rules.\n\nMost law schools just assume that students will figure out why they are reading cases as they go along. But if you understand the purpose of the reading, and take advantage of the reading to actually practice the relevant skills, you can be more effective in your studies and your practice.\n\nIf you are asking how to do good in your exams, then practice is also the key. The goal is to Learn to recognize fact patters and understand what rules should apply. For learning the rules, see above. For writing the essay, remember your IRAC. Don't skip the analysis portion. Be thorough, and write simply. \n\nWhen in doubt, do practice exams from past classes. Most professors are willing to read your practice exams and give you feedback. Practice is the key.",244

1,"How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? ; I really want to know. ; Dear Chucky,\n\nA woodchuck would chuck wood until he could no longer chuck would or no longer felt like chucking wood was a good thing to do or perhaps if he/ she chucked wood and got a heart attack he would have to stop. If the woodchuck met a freind while chucking wood and decided to go for a beer and a clice of apple pie he or she might stop and then that would be it. So perhaps the correst answer is that the woodchuck would chuck as much would as he or she felt like or was able too depending on the relative circumstances of this animal's reality. I hope this helps. My neighbour is a woodchuck and often is not very consistent when chucking. At least we know that they actually can chuck and it is not a question could anymore.

9,"Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? ; Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? \n\n\nBy Derek Shaw \nThe Daily Trojan\nOctober 4, 2002 \nGeorge Orwell's ""1984"" depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. The threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the ""Party,"" the single political power in the totalitarian state of Oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people.\n\nSound somewhat familiar? Well it should ...\n\nAs the likelihood of war in the Middle East continues to escalate, American citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing Americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. \n\nWithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in ""1984"" to the affairs of today.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nIn ""1984,"" the bold slogan of the Party is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" This set of socio-political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. The assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption.\n\nThe state of Oceania in ""1984"" is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever-shifting enemy. The government leads the public to \n\nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact \n\nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. One day the enemy is Eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is Eastasia and has always been Eastasia. The people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. The real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred.\n\nToday we are facing imminent war with Iraq. A year ago our target was al-Qaida and bin Laden. Then it became a battle within Afghanistan. And just to be sure, President George W. Bush openly labeled Iran, North Korea and Iraq as the ""axis of evil."" In a later speech, he added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIndeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. On Aug. 22, 2002, Bush called Saddam Hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. Granted, Hussein is not the first person on most of our Christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? Surely it is a mere coincidence that Bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting Iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world.\n\nIn many ways, Bush has become the physical manifestation of Big Brother, the omnipotent, all-knowing symbol of leadership in Oceania. In ""1984,"" Big Brother is both feared and loved by the people. His power goes untested. Similarly, the Bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the American people have responded with a show of faith and support. In fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show American pride with stickers, T-shirts and flags. A frenzy of nationalism has infected our country; and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the United States.\n\nAs a result, American freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. In ""1984,"" signs re ; With massive data bases of information piling up in government and corporate computers as well as security cameras around every corner and on every cell phone, I often get the feeling Big Brother is watching.  However, I feel Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is better example of the direction we have been moving as a society.  Everywhere people are seeking their own ""Soma"" to cover up our social flaws.  We are also pushing closer and closer to his predictions of class and family structures .",272

The reason that there are still other apes is that they and we had a common ancestor several million years ago.  Chimpanzees, for example, have evolved just as much in the intervening time as we have - Biologists do not say that chimps or monkeys we see today are our ancestors, as is sometimes mistakenly claimed.\n\nHence the ""why are there still apes?"" question is invalid, and due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nAgreed? ; Yep. I totally agree that it is due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nI once was told, as an example of why evolution was faulty, that ""you cannot put a typewriter into a closet and open up the door a few days later and expect it to be a computer"".

I know several very ""girlish"" and very good engineers. \n\nThere are some very real and practical questions you must address before you sink $50k and about 5 years of your life into engineering school (high school counselors and even college counselors don't really understand this part). What do you LIKE to do? What do you think ""feels"" like a natural skill to you? Is this electrical work, gears and mechanics, chemistry, computers, etc? Go with a natural fit, don't force yourself to try and love computers just because you think it's the most successful route. After you have that hammered out, find out what is in demand in your area or someplace that you want to move (yes, there are unemployed engineers with skills that don't fit the location). An easy way to do this is look at some of the job boards and find out what types of engineers people are hiring. \n\nPicking a school: this is VERY important. You must make sure the engineering school is ACCREDITED by ABET. Anyone can legally hand out non-accredited engineering degrees. ABET schools are a whole different ballgame. Don't waste your time and money! \n\nOk, you picked a school, great! At this point, there are 3 things you need to do: 1. keep your GPA over 3.2. 2. Join at least one engineering association that fits your discipline (ASME, SAE, ACM, AUVSI...many to choose from). 3. Participate in internships and/or co-ops.

Adding to natural embarrassment of sexual assault victim to report the sexual offences, there is the additional fact that it is considered to be funny.\n\n\nMOVIES, TV, COMMERCIALS, THEY ALWAYS MAKE BELIEVE THAT IT IS JUSTIFIED TO KICK SOMEONE IN THE PRIVATES FOR STUPID REASONS, AND IS FUNNY, AND IT ONLY HURTS BUT DO NOT CAUSE ANY DAMAGE(they use the “kick in the balls” to sell because it is something controversial, but then forget to make people believe that is a bad thing and that the person who did it was a villain in the movie, and then in real life others will pay the price). \nWomen think is funny and hot by nature, but men are brain washed to think is funny, and think not a big deal, with the big help of TV. That is why men sometimes laugh or hide their TRUE DEEP feelings about it.\n\nAnd btw, most women try to hide that they get sexual satisfaction from kicking men in the balls(to me that was always obvious), they only admit that it is funny. \nEven with the foot it is touching; and the laughing they make when they do it or see it happen it is not like the laughing when they laugh about a good joke, it is very different, it is the sexual aroused laughing that is natural on females when sexual aroused. Not to mention other facial, body and behaviour expressions that also indicates sexual arousal, which is their main motivation(other related motivations are enjoying “male only” PAIN done by a women, enjoying sexual HUMILIATION, and all those things are FUNNY).\nAnd I have many other prove of that, I have their opinions on surveys about this issue, I video interviews with random women on the streets and also professional “ballbusters”, they talk about their feelings and about the other girls feelings and also conversations with other girls with different ages(age do not matter, the always fell the same way about it, so the “immature” excuse is not valid), and they also talk about their and other girls experiences.",292

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",302

If that theory is correct then we are all descendants of Africans fairly recently.\n\nThe second theory is that  different human groups evolved from different pre-human ancestors. So people in south east Asia evolved from Homo erectus in that part of the world, people in western Europe evolved form Neanderthals and people in southern Africa evolved from local erectus populations there. Since then the various populations have commingled and interbred. If that theory is correct then there may well be people with little or no recent African ancestry.",306

1,"Marine Biology? ; PLEASE read my entire paragraph before answering, i am asking two things.\nI am very interested in oceanic life, especially deep sea life, and i was wondering if one could find a job in marine biology and earn a good wage? I am a sophmore in HS and i am trying to find out what my carreer will be. Also, a friend of mine that will be joining the military this summer said that there i can be a marine biologist in the navy. I am not absolutely sure if i can get into college atm because i only have a ""b"" GPA (weighted), so i might be considering a military life. Would it be better to join the military even if i am accepted at a college? The military pays 100% of the cost to go to college and i can also get a retirement fund. Does anyone, preferably a biologist, have any suggestions of what i should do? \nThis is a repost becuase the limited amount of people that DID reply didnt go into detail, please be specific, it would be a shame for me to have to post a third time ; You most definently do not have to go into the military to be a marine biologist. There are a large number of marine biology programs worldwide, a B average will get you into most of them. DO NOT join the military just because you have a B average, that is more than sufficient to get into a good program. I am a biologist with a BS, MS and am currently working on a PhD, after having been an average high school student. The first step is to buy one of those college guides, you will be able to find all the schools that have marine biology programs. Pick a few that seem most interesting based on geography, reputation and cost. Apply when you are about to graduate and pick from among the ones that accept you. Good luck!",336

Me and my family moved in another house in september. So obviously I changed my school, too, because it was to far away from our house. But the thing is that in the other school I moved from, my father teached there. So everyone knew I was his daughter and most of them didn't dare to say anything to me. And the teachers didn't treated me like any ordinary child, I mean... they didn't give me a small note if I didn't learn something that day, they would've forgive me and told me to learn for the next day or something like that.

So it was something like that: \nIn the first day in my new school, I was so scared!

When she was in her early twenties, and before she had a child, she ate everything and still maintained her 125 lb. weight at 5'8"".

She has cut the fast food down to twice a week and no supersizing and she's an amazing cook at home, but  she's gained probably 50 lbs. I cant get her to go out with me because she's ""too fat"", all she wears is my brothers t-shirts and her sweats. She's got the ""pear"" shape so she won't wear shorts in 90 degree weather and she tells me that she just loves certain foods so much, she cant control the cravings. I understand somewhat, I try to keep a healthy diet, and to be honest, if you dont have time to make it happen, food that helps you lose weight tastes like crap! Btw, she can't do Weight Watchers etc., she tried once and couldn't afford it. Her love for fried chicken and doughnuts is tearing her up emotionally! ; Hello Christifsu\n\nSo much is made of the food people eat and that is the cause of their weight gain. the answer to your sister seems to be in the statement you made of her. ""When she was young she could eat everything and not gain weight"" This demonstrates there is not much wrong with her genetically as she spent many years eating normally. The reason she cannot stop herself now is as a result of an Anxiety that is similar to the feeling of hunger that she cannot relieve in other ways so she takes the message of hunger and tries to relieve that. This type of hunger can never be satisfied. Look for the source of her anxiety. some seven years prior to her first starting to gain weight. \n\nHope this is help full for you both.",365

I teach 8th graders and I can't believe that I see in them the same attitudes you are speaking of.  They are getting this 'spoon feed me attitude' from their parents.

She is the most perfect girl I've ever met and wouldn't give her up for the world. (She also has a 1-year old son but that isn't vital information for the situation.) The problem is, I've been military for the past 4 years and don't live that close to her. I used to live in Virginia, but, when I return from my tour in Korea, I will be moving to Idaho. I'm really moving there for college, but it also places me closer to her. The problem still is she lives on an island that can't be driven to easily from Idaho. The best way to get there is to fly, which costs roughly $450. I can't really afford to go there often due to the price, so we're going to be able to see each other only about 3-4 times per year. What is the best way to make this work? ; Dude, if she is such a great girl then this is really quite easy.  You sure as heck don't walk away.  School is going to take up a lot of your time and it is taking up a lot of her time also.  So in reality you two aren't really missing out on a lot of time together.  The key is to plan the times you can be together and make the most of them.  If you can see each other 4 times a year for 2 or more weeks each time then that is over two full months together a year dedicated to spending time together.  A lot of couples who live together barely spend that much time together.  Hold on to what you got and hopefully by the time you each graduate she will be ready for marriage and you two can then be together.",384

7,"what is your dream job? ; (i wanna be an actress) ; I really really really want to manage my own inn. When I was in high school, I was actually a science stream student. I took up science because my parents wanted me to be an engineer (sigh). I have always been dreaming of running a hotel. MY hotel. The steakhouse would be superb. The lobby would fit a wedding ceremony. The bar would be the talk of the town. All of the customers would be well-attended and personal preferrence of each and every regulars would be noted. When I was choosing a course for my undergraduate studies, my parents asked me to take up mathematics, but without their knowledge, I changed my option to Business (majoring in Tourism and Hospitality) - the degree that I ahve been eyeing since 5 years back! I knew it was a risk because I don't have any basics in Business. I even failed my accounts when I was 15! But I was thinking to myself - Nick, either you take up this course and finally you can own a hotel you've been dreaming of since you were a kid, or you can take up Mathematics or Engineering and die without achieving your greatest dream."" So I opted for my dream course - and they accepted me. To me, the only key to success is that, if I love what I study, I can prove to others that even WITHOUT basics in Business, I can get good grades. I'd do almost anything to make my dream come true. Now, I've made a lot of contacts with the personnels from several hotels around town (I even knew the Human Resource Manager of one five star hotel) and also several travel agents...and I actually just finished my first year of studies. My grades? For the first semester, suprisingly, I got 3.42 (a mere 0.08 shy from getting Dean's List) and last semester, I got 3.77. Were the lecturers helpfull? You might be suprised if I tell you that some mentioned to the class that ""Oh, you've learned this chapter when you were in high school, so I'd skip this one"" - most of the time. (99% of students have Business backgrounds). Were last semester's subjects easy? Most of my friends' grades were going down...and they were frantically suprised to see me, knowing NOTHING on Business the first time they met me, emerged as the best student among 300+ students from my faculty. What was my motivation? ""I'd do almost anything to make my dream come true"". And I hope you would too.\n\nSincely,\nNick Ramzey\nFuture Manager and Owner of Kipalli's Inn",430

1,"Memetic evolution? ; Need references and opinions on whether this realy is the new DNA. ; Memes are things passed down culturally from one generation to the next such as religion.  Memetic evolution is the change of cultural customs that are passed down from generation to generation over time.  Memes are not a form of DNA at all and are just mental thoughts that are passed down verbally or otherwise over time. Memes exist, but there are no genes or DNA involved in memetic evolution.  So this is not the new DNA, but is a reference referring to the fidelity with which culture is passed on from one generation to the next.\n\nThe term meme was coined by Oxford evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book, ""The Selfish Gene"", which I believe was first published around 1973.  Any Dawkins text would serve as a good source to study memes or memetic evolution.

This is causing them to question whether or not the biblical account of Noah's ark could be true. Many people are rereading the Biblical description of the Ark to ascertain the feasibility of such a vessel to fulfill its designated purpose in light of present day knowledge of both zoology and our present day knowledge of shipbuilding.\n \nSize comparison between average size one-story home and Noah's Ark. Illustration from The World that Perished.How big was Noah's Ark?\n""And God said unto Noah… Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt though make in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of… the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."" (Gen. 6:14-16)\n \nA cubit is the distance between an adult's elbow and tip of the finger, no less than 18-inches [45.72 centimeters]. (Scene from The World that Perished.)Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been no less than 18 inches long [45.72 centimeters]. This means that the ark would have been at least 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716000000000001 meters]. Noah's Ark was said to have been the largest sea-going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood.\n\nThese dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 cubits in all directions and with nine decks. Such a vessel would spin slowly round and round in the water and from the standpoint of stability, would be a disaster.\n\nWas the ark big enough to hold the number of animals required?\nThe total available floor space on the ark would have been over 100,000 square feet, which would be more floor space than in 20 standard-sized basketball courts.\n \nAssuming an 18-inch cubit [45.72 centimeters], Noah's Ark would have had a cubic volume equal to 569 modern railroad stock cars.The total cubic volume would have been 1,518,000 cubic feet [462,686.4 cubic meters] --that would be equal to the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars.\n\nNow comes the question, how many land dwelling air breathing animals would have had to be taken aboard the ark to survive the flood?\n\nAccording to Ernest Mayr, America's leading taxonomist, there are over 1 million species of animals in the world.\n \nGod only provided the Ark for the protection of humans and land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures. A huge number of animals would not need to be taken aboard the Ark because they are water dwellers. Representatives would be expected to survive the catastrophe. With God's protection against extinction during the Deluge, survival would have been assured. (Scene from The World that Perished, a Christian motion picture about the Flood)However, the vast majority of these are capable of surviving in water and would not need to be brought aboard the ark. Noah need make no provision for the 21,000 species of fish or the 1,700 tunicates (marine chordates like sea squirts) found th",457

Thanks and Regards - JON ; You can store it in batteries and it lasts as long as the batteries last.\n\nThe sun produces a huge amount of energy every day (173 millions of billions Watts). The amount we receive generates wind (converted into electricity through windmills), heat, photosynthesis of plants and trees and 1.37kw of energy per square metre. This energy can be harnessed by PV cells and converted into electricity. In fact, less than 1% of our planet’s desert areas would generate all the electricity we need if it was covered with PV panels.\nGenerating electricity this way is quite simple: light hits a cell made of a thin layer of silicium over a metal support which generates electrons. The motion of these electrons generates current. PV cells are assembled in panels, generating up to 100w/h of DC power (14v approximately). These panels are connected to a regulator, which controls the electricity production, sends some to appliances, some to battery storage and dumps any excess. PV panels generate electricity when subjected to sunlight. This means they do not produce at night. This is why most systems store electricity in batteries.\n \nHOUSING APPLICATIONS\nA modern house does not require a lot of electricity and it does not seem very efficient to burn diminishing fossil resources in huge plants located far away and then transport this electricity over hundreds of kilometers to houses. By having a few PV panels on the roof, any ordinary house can generate its electrical needs; this power can be supplied in DC (for halogen lighting for example) and AC (220V) through an inverter to power standard appliances.\n \nA house connected to the grid can then sell electricity by day and buy some back at night.\nAn independent house generates all its needs by storing electricity in battery banks. In windy areas, a windmill can be a very good complement to PV systems.\n \nPV systems do not require fuel, have no moving parts that can wear, require virtually no maintenance and last for a very long time (some PV systems have a 30 years warranty).\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\nThey constitute the bulk of the applications today, for remote lighting, transmitters, satellites in space, etc. Industrial buildings could also produce part of their needs through PV.\n \nCOST MATTERS\nIs PV technology expensive? Prices are now going down and make it ever more competitive. PV systems last a very long time and over say 50 years, they should become extremely competitive.\nThe cost of fossil fuels is expected to increase over the next 20 years. Furthermore, fossil fuel generators require heavy maintenance. Another aspect to take in account is the pollution they generate: this has a heavy cost in terms of global warming, poor air quality, health problems and logistic costs (transport of fossil fuels, electricity on high power lines and their waste), not to mention collateral damage such as oil slicks, Chernobyl type accidents, respiratory diseases, chemical runoffs and other nasty results.",473

1,"is this even possible to solve and if u can how? ; After the parade, the ppl on the float I was on shook hands with eachother. The Mayor came over and shook hands with only the people he knew. How many people did he know if there were 1625 handshakes altogether? ; The answer is that the mayor knew 29 people. And, although you didn't ask it, there were 57 people on the float.\n\nProof:\nGiven a group of n people, if everybody shakes hands once with every other member of the group then there will be (n(n-1))/2 handshakes in total.\n1. If there were 58 people on the float then there would have been ((58*57)/2)=1653 handshakes. But this is more than the total number of handshakes specified in the question so there must have been less than 58 people on the float.\n2. If there were 56 people on the float then there would have been ((56*55)/2)=1540 handshakes. This would mean that the mayor would have had to shake hands with 85 people in order for the total number of handshakes to equal 1625. But if there were only 56 people on the float then it is impossible for the mayor to shake hands 85 times (assuming he only shakes hands once with each person he knows). So there must be more than 56 people on the float.\n2. If there were 57 people on the float then there would have been ((57*56)/2)=1596 handshakes. If the mayor shakes hands with 29 of the 57 people on the float then there would have been 1596+29=1625 handshakes which is what you wanted to know.\n\nBTW: Next time vote for a female mayor - she might have been gracious enough to shake hands with everybody on the float :)",497

5,"when was the first time someone used a snowboard and what country or if in usa what state.? ; please answer this correctly it for a school assiment. ; Did you know that the first of the snowboards goes back all the way to 1929? Back then they has skis, but the first person to come up with the idea of a snowboard was a man named M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett. He cut out a plank of plywood and tried to stick his feet to the wood with the help of some clothes and horse reins. It was over 30 years after Burchett that the next step was taken towards the evolution of snowboards. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a chemical gases engineer in Muskegon invented the “The Snurfer”. The name was given by his wife. He came up with the “The Snurfer” in order to entertain his daughter. He made the Snurfer by putting two skis together and putting a rope at the nose so that the rider could hold it and keep it stable. Many of his friends were interested in this Snurfer and that inspired him into licensing his idea to a manufacturer. The Snurfer sold over half a million in 1966 but was only seen as a toy for kids, not something serious enough for adult entertainment. Poppen organized competitions in order to make the Snurfer even more poppular. Jake Burton was really into the Snurfer and participated in the competitions organized by Poppen. Since Burton’s parents wouldn’t buy him a board and let him surf, he amused himself with the Snurfer. He was also very into skiing alongside the Snurfer, but he broke his collarbone in a car accident and couldn’t participate in ski competitions anymore. Meanwhile, a college student, &#92;Dimitrije Milovich started making snowboards in 1969. He came up with the idea after sliding down with a cafeteria plate in College. He started his own company in 1972 with the name “Winterstick”. He got reviewed on Newsweek and Playboy, which increased the popularity of snowboards. Although he left the business in 1980, he is still recognised as one of the most important pioneers in developing snowboards. In 1977, Burton, after graduating from NYU moved to Vermont and started producing new versions of the Snurfer which he still remembered from childhood. He came up with the first binding and he amazed people when he won the Snurfer competition with his very own board with the bindings on it.",500

1,"Why does vitamin d cause thirst? ; For instance, drinking milk or anything else fortified with vitamin d will only make me more thirsty after 5 or 10 minutes. ; Your experience is interesting!  My first thought is as follows:  Vitamin D inhibits the renin-angiotensin system which plays a role in fluid balance (and therefore blood pressure) in the body.  You may have a genetic polymorphism (variation) creating a 'hypersensitivity' to vitamin D in this system.  However, if Vitamin D is really the cause of your thirst response, does exposure to sunlight also produce this effect in 5 or 10 minutes?  Lastly, I would expect it to take longer than 5 or 10 minutes for any vitamin D consumed to actually get into your blood stream.\n\nSo....if I haven't confused you by now, I guess the best answer I can offer is....

3,"where can i find the history of nachos? ; i'm  doin a report on them and none of the search sites give me what i want!!! ; BY KAREN HARAM SAN ANTONIO EXPRESS-NEWS A fried tostado. Yellow cheese. A slice of jalapeno. So simple. So delicious. So monumental. Back in 1943, Ignacio ""Nacho"" assembled the first he had no idea that 60 years later, this appetizer would have made his nickname a household word. At that time, the senior Anaya was working at a restaurant owned by Rudolfo De Los Santos, the Victory Club in Piedras Negras, Mexico, just across the border from Eagle Pass, says his son Ignacio Anaya Jr. of Eagle Pass. As Anaya Jr. recalls the story, Mamie Finan and a group of 10 to 12 officers' wives, whose husbands were stationed at Fort Duncan Air Base, traveled across the border to eat at the Victory Club. When the senior Anaya couldn't find. the cook, he went into action. ""My father was maitre d' and he said 'Let me go quick and fix something for you.' He went into the kitchen, picked up tostados,' grated some cheese on them - Wisconsin cheese, the round one - and put them under the Salamander (a broiling unit that quickly browns the top of foods). He pulled them out after a couple minutes, all melted, and put on a slice of jalapeno."" - The name of the snack, Anaya Jr. says, came from Finan, who called the plate of cheese- and chile-topped chips Nacho's Especiales. The name was later shortened to simply ""nachos."" Anaya Sr. went on to work at the Moderno, which is still in business today, as well as his own Nacho's Restaurant in Piedras Negras. In 1960, Anaya Jr. looked into helping his father, who died in 1975, claim ownership of the nacho. ""I talked to a lawyer in San Antonio. He said there's not much you can do after 17 years. It's in the public domain,"" Anaya Jr. says. As a tribute to his father, Anaya Jr. serves as a judge for an annual nacho competition held in Piedras Niegras me second weekend each October. There, nachos are topped with everything from huitlacoche to caviar. But his favorite remains the original nachos like his father made, though he gives high marks to beef and chicken nachos topped with guacamole. ""That's a whole meal,"" he says. Anaya Sr.'s granddaughter, Cristina de Los Santos of San Antonio, says her grandfather died when she was in elementary school. But she remembers the leg-end of Nacho, and his nachos, as family lore. ""When I was little, my family would always tell me the story,"" she says. Better yet, when she would go to her grandfather's restaurant in Piedras Negras, he would make nachos for her. ""I didn't like cheese. He always made me bean nachos,"" she says. De Los Santos says her father, Anaya Jr., like her grandfather, ""makes nachos real good. He makes them the original way."" Though she doesn't have a recipe, she describes the process as follows: Tortilla chips, cut in triangles, are fried in what she calls shortening, not oil. The fried chips are salted, then topped with yellow cheese. The chips are run under the broiler, then topped with a slice of jalapeno. Although she's a fan of many types of nachos and occasionally orders them when dining out, the ones she gets today taste far different from those her grandfather made. ""The chips are different,"" she says. ""They're not homemade chips like he used to do. Or maybe it's the hands of the chef."" \nNow here is where the story gets even better. The tasty snack becomes a specialty in many restaurants in Southern Texas but is virtually unknown anywhere else on the planet. That is until a gentleman by the name of Frank Liberto decided to try to sell the stuff as a concession stand item! He changed up the recipe by reformulating the cheese to be soft all the time and using simple tortilla chips. He began to sell his new version of nachos in 1977 in Arlington Stadium in Arlington Texas. but what really made the concept take off was a visit by ""Monday Night Football"" later that year.

9,"My boyfriend, from England will have been here for 89 days before he goes back. He wants to visit this summer? ; Can he stay for another couple of months on holiday? Someone told me he can only be here a total of 6 months per year. Is that per calendar year? We're not yet ready to marry so we can't get a fiance  visa, he'd love to find work here and stay though. ; Under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) citizens of certain countries can come here for upto 90 days without getting a visa.  They can still get other visas such as the B1/B2 visa which would allow them to stay up to 6 months.\n\nThe advantage of the VWP is that they just need a machine readable passport and a return ticket and a good story to tell the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer (if he askes).\n\nThe disadvantages of a VWP are that the visitor must leave within 90 days or they can be barred from using it in the future (make SURE that the green form is turned into the airline on his departure).\n\nThe main disadvantage is that the visitor signs away (waives) all recourse.  The CBP officer at the port of arrival can ""just say no"" and back on the plane the visitor goes without recourse.  Also a VWP does not allow adjustment of status.  For example, you two find true love and get married, too bad, back he goes!\n\nIf he came in under a B1/B2 (or other visas) or even as an Entry Without Inspection EWI (pronounced Eee Wee) he can adjust status in some circumstances.\n\nIf he works at all, even for tips at a diner, he is ""out of status"" and is the easiest illegal to process.  [catching VWP violators are the most fun.  The paperwork is minimal and language is not usually a problem!]\n\nMillions of people would love to find work here and stay.\n\nTo you and any other US citizen considering marriage to an alien.\n\nIt amazes me how many divorces occur once the alien gets the ""lawful permanent resident"" (pronounced ""Lapper"") or green card.\n\nAlso a LPR who gets arrested can be deported back home.

6,"are you going to start charging to email? ; we heard you are going to charge money to send emails   are you?? ; YOU'RE RIGHT, TO A CERTAIN DEGREE!..............\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) - Yahoo and America Online will offer ""certified"" email service that guarantees credible senders delivery for a fee.\n\nBusinesses that make the grade when it comes to legitimacy and email track records will be assured message delivery to recipients' main Yahoo or AOL inboxes for a quarter of a cent to one cent per message.\n\nGoodmail Services of Mountain View, California, worked for more than two years with AOL and Yahoo on certified email service intended to thwart phishing and other online scams, said Goodmail co-founder Richard Gingras.\n\n""The email inbox has become a dangerous place,"" Gingras told AFP. ""It doesn't say much for our email medium when it is not as reliable or trusted as should be"".\n\nCertified email will bypass spam filters and be routed directly into the main inboxes of designated recipients. Yahoo and AOL represent half the primary personal email accounts in the United States, according to Gingras.\n\nGoodmail will handle sender accounts and certify mail, which will get priority handling by AOL and Yahoo. ""Postage"" revenues will be split evenly between Goodmail and the Internet companies.\n\n""We will be announcing partnerships with other mailbox providers in the coming months,"" Gingras said. ""We thought it was important to start with the big players.""\n\nConcerns that personal email users will have to pay for email or that ""spammers"" could buy their way into inboxes were ""absolutely absurd,"" Gingras said.\n\n""From the outset, this was a very consumer-centric solution,"" Gingras said. ""What we've crafted is a means to allow consumers to feel safe in dealing with commercial messages.""\n\nThe American Red Cross has signed on for certified email to distinguish its messages from online imposters using the charity's name to con donations from people, according to Gingras.\n\n""It should be easy for anyone in the world to get an email address at little or no cost without having to show an ID,"" Gingras said.\n\n""That is also the problem. People can take advantage. It is the classic tragedy of the commons.""\n\nEmail is evolving to mirror traditional postal service, which has options ranging from bulk mail to express overnight delivery, Gingras said.\n\nHowever, some were worried that the new service could be imposed on customers.\n\nCommercial email senders must be permitted to decline using certified mail or they are likely to take their business elsewhere, said analyst Laura Koetzle of Forrester Research.\n\n""It's a kind of Mafia tactic because it's a lot like racketeering in order to recoup some of their costs,"" Koetzle said of the thought that mailbox providers could compel businesses to use certified email.\n\nHowever, Gingras insisted it was not a mandatory service. ""Some less enlightened email marketers have shot back and said they don't want to be paying,"" Gingras said.\n\n""Certified email is an option; if they want to build trust,"" he said.\n\nYahoo and AOL promised that their standard email services would remain free.\n\n""For years, our top priority has been to protect users from spam and email scams, and to ensure users receive the messages they want and value,"" Yahoo said in a written release.\n\n""Yahoo is planning to test a new 'certified email' system from Goodmail in the coming months, with the goal of providing additional user protection against spam and phishing scams.""\n\nAOL predicted it would implement certified email service within two months.\n\n""FedEx and US Postal provide that in the offline world; it's all about safety and security,"" AOL said in a written statement.",530

3,"How do i keep teens amused?? ; i am taking a group of teens on a community service trip which will involve a lot of hard manual labour... Its in outback Australia so there is little to do... what can i organise for them to keep them happy?? ; You are brave indeed!\n\nI'm the mother of four teenagers and former teenagers and have had three others live with me and have had lots of them just kind of hanging around, eating me out of house and home.\n\nWhat I would offer you is the knowledge that teenagers love being together.  What they do while they are together is usually second to the experience of just being able to spend time together.\n\nThings that the very varied group here have enjoyed are:\n\nmusic--this is key!  I'd suggest playing a variety and giving the music-makers among them a chance to play for the others.  A dance is a nearly universally enjoyed experience and they can dance in the outback, dressed in shorts and tee shirts as well as they can in prom gowns and tuxes.  If you slap a theme on the thing, they'usually like to talk about what they'll wear for weeks--you'll get a lot of mileage out of that.  I guess I wouldn't suggest the theme my daughter's Homecoming Committee had for their dance--Survivor--since you'll be living it all of the time, but something like a luau theme or a club theme will give the girls something to primp for.\n\nContests are good, too.  One son was in a group in high school that went on long scavenger hunts.  You might have them find things native to the area you'll be in which will help them to learn about the place they are living.  Or you could make it a treasure hunt, with clues to follow and something good to find.  \nRelay races, the kinds of games they like playing when at home (frisbees seem to be used a lot around here), even board game night can be successful.  I think I'd try to come up with some tournaments, too, where people play something and progress or are eliminated, but can still root for others.  I seem to have Frisbees on the brain today, but Frisbee golf might work for this or even a card game that isn't too complicated.  I think I'd try to organize some things as team efforts and some as individual efforts.  And it's really important to include kids whose talents aren't in the area of physical might.  Checkers, chess, a talent show;  there are plenty of activities that tap different abilities.\n\nYou didn't say if you would have access to equipment to show DVD's, but if you do, Movie Night would be good, or maybe the chance for kids to check somethings out of a movie library.  Oh!  And don't forget reading material, crossword puzzles (another contest/race perhaps?), Sudoku puzzles...\n\nYes, I am really getting enthusiastic here!  Can I come along?\n\n(You could also form a committe drawn from the kids or their parents to help come up with ideas.  They know what they like to do, right?  And don't forget--teenagers eat A LOT, especially kids who are working hard.)",533

The people of the Caucasian Isthmus, Khaldi people (or Khalib/Halyb and Halisones by Strabo) were one of the oldest west-Georgian tribes (4th to 2nd millennia BC).\n\nBy 2500 BCE to 2000 BCE, increasing numbers of smelted iron objects (distinguishable from meteoric iron by the lack of nickel in the product) appear in Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and Egypt[citation needed]. However, their use appears to be ceremonial, and iron was an expensive metal, more expensive than gold[citation needed, especially as regards to pricing concerning gold, as the word is often confused with ""bronz"" in ancient texts].",543

Everyone loved soilent green, it was tastier, but there was a horrible state secret.......  it was people....  from those suicide centers.  \n\nDefinitely a nightmare scenario, but thankfully, with genetic engineering and plant sciences, we have overcome that food problem, and are all going to die out from complications of global warming or nuclear war rather than this particular overpopulation scenario.  I guess we could starve, but state sponsored cannibalism is probably not on the menu.  Then again, I never thought the US would go for  GITMO or the NSA domestically spying, either.",565

0,"Dreamcatchers..? ; I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything? ; The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t",588

3,"What were 3 main causes of the civil war?? ; I have a test tomorrow in social studies! ; The Civil War was caused by a myriad of conflicting pressures, principles, and prejudices, fueled by sectional differences and pride, and set into motion by a most unlikely set of political events.\n\nAt the root of all of the problems was the institution of slavery, which had been introduced into North America in early colonial times. The American Revolution had been fought to validate the idea that all men were created equal, yet slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies throughout the revolutionary period. Although it was largely gone from the northern states by 1787, it was still enshrined in the new Constitution of the United States, not only at the behest of the Southern ones, but also with the approval of many of the Northern delegates who saw that there was still much money to be made in the slave trade by the Yankee shipping industry. Eventually its existence came to color every aspect of American life.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention there were arguments over slavery. Representatives of the Northern states claimed that if the Southern slaves were mere property, then they should not be counted toward voting representation in Congress. Southerners, placed in the difficult position of trying to argue, at least in this case, that the slaves were human beings, eventually came to accept the three-fifths compromise, by which five slaves counted as three free men toward that representation. By the end of the convention the institution of slavery itself, though never specifically mentioned, was well protected within the body of the Constitution.\n\nIt seemed to Thomas Jefferson and many others that slavery was on its way out, doomed to die a natural death. It was becoming increasingly expensive to keep slaves in the agrarian society of the south. Northern and Southern members of Congress voted together to abolish the importation of slaves from overseas in 1808, but the domestic slave trade continued to flourish. The invention of the cotton gin made the cultivation of cotton on large plantations using slave labor a profitable enterprise in the deep South. The slave became an ever more important element of the southern economy, and so the debate about slavery, for the southerner, gradually evolved into an economically based question of money and power, and ceased to be a theoretical or ideological issue at all. It became an institution that southerners felt bound to protect.\n\nBut even as the need to protect it grew, the ability, or at least the perceived ability of the South to do so was waning. Southern leaders grew progressively more sensitive to this condition. In 1800 half of the population of the United States had lived in the South. But by 1850 only a third lived there and the disparity continued to widen. While northern industrial opportunity attracted scores of immigrants from Europe in search of freedom the South's population stagnated. Even as slave states were added to the Union to balance the number of free ones, the South found that its representatives in the House had been overwhelmed by the North’s explosive growth. More and more emphasis was now placed on maintaining parity in the Senate. Failing this, the paranoid theory went, the South would find itself at the mercy of a government in which it no longer had an effective voice. Never mind that slavery was protected under the constitution, and that it would have been impossible to make amendments to abolish it. Jefferson Davis, at the time a Senator from Mississippi, summed up the sectionalist argument himself. Speaking, in effect, to the people of the North concerning slavery, “It is not humanity that influences you… it is that you may have a majority in the Congress of the United States and convert the Government into an engine of Northern aggrandizement… you want by an unjust system of legislation to promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.” There, in plain English, is the shrill, accusat",593

However, there is a house across the street from me that is rented out.

From what you describe, this is very likely.\n\nThen, you  call the cops each time you notice drug activity, noises, altercations, etc. Get copies of all police reports, and notify your state's agency that covers section 8 assistance.

1,"Could you please compare the actions of the hormones Prolactin and Oxytocin? ; Also, please state the glands secreting them. ; After birth, the mother's estrogen and progesterone levels decrease thus causing the anterior pituatary to produce prolactin.  Prolactin gets the breast ready to secrete milk.  During lactation prolactin also synthesizes the milk.  Prolactin production is stimulated by the infant suckling.  \nOxytocin is also a hormone that plays a role in lactation.  Just as prolactin is stimulated by infant suckling, so is oxytocin.  As the infant suckles, the posterior pituary is triggered to produce oxytocin.  Oxytocin is responsible for the milk ejection reflex.  This reflex is accomplished by oxytocin stimulating the myoepithelial cell around the nipple and allowing the milk to be expressed through the ducts and out the nipple.",610

1,"why do some people have slight humps at the top of their spines on the splenius capitis area? ; I am covering human anatomy to qualify as holistic therapist and need to know this answer ; That is a condition known as kyphosis, or Scheuermann’s disease.  This condition occurs when the front of the upper spine does not grow as fast as the back of the spine, so that the vertebrae become wedge-shaped, with the narrow part of the wedge in front. The wedge-shape of the vertebrae creates an increase in the amount of normal kyphosis (front angulation of the thoracic spine). \n\nThe wedging of vertebrae in Scheuermann’s kyphosis is most common in the thoracic spine (upper back), with the apex of the curve typically between the T7 and T9 levels of the spine. Although less common, Scheuermann’s kyphosis may also occur in the junction between the thoracic and lumbar spine (thoracolumbar spine) or in the lumbar spine (lower back). \n\nThe cause of Scheuermann's disease is unknown, but is thought to be due to a growth abnormality of the vertebral body. The growth plate anteriorly (in the front) stops growing but the posterior part of the growth plate continues to grow. This is due to a condition known as osteochondrosis. \n\nScheuermann’s disease does not spread and is not really a “disease” but a condition that can arise during growth. It is more common in males and appears in adolescents usually towards the end of their growth spurt, but can occur in anyone.\n\nIf the roundback deformity is severe, patients are more likely to have discomfort or pain along with the deformity as they age. \n\nLearn more about it at the website below.

2,"Are rowing machines considered cardio or resistance? ; I've been wondering this for awhile.  On one hand you're constantly moving and it's not THAT hard, like a cardio exercise, but on the other hand you push off with your legs & pull the handle with your arms (which puts off quite a bit of resistance!)  So is a rowing machine considered cardio, resistance, or a happy medium of both? ; Both!\nAny activity that challenges your muscles at loads greater than they are accustomed to via concentric and eccentric contraction is considered resistance exercise.  The duration of the movement and energy system being used then classifies the exercise as cardiovascular or otherwise.\n\nFor example if you were to row as quickly as possible for 10 seconds or less you would primarily use the phosphagen/creatine system which provides ATP immediately to the muscle, so the energy needs are fast and powerful.\n\nIf you were to then continue rowing for 20s to 90s you would involve the glycolytic system (glucose/lactic acid) and anaerobic contributions of to ATP delivery would increase.\n\nIt's not until about 2+ min that you require a much greater oxygen utilization which would kick-in the aerobic system hence a full cardiovascular workout.\n\nSo it really does depend on how long you decide to row.  Since most people row for extends periods, it's usually classified as a cardiovascular exercise although the argument to oppose it would have to fall under the above guidelines.",643

2,"Runners: increasing mileage? ; I seem to have reached a plateau mileage: 7 miles. I'm training for a 1/2 marathon and can't seem to get past this mileage. Any tips for me? ; Depnds on your training. I was in track and the coach always had us running up bleachers, the church steps (there were 120 steps), and he used the parachute or the ortho ban ( a giant rubber band that ortho uses for knees and ankles), or a make shift. BO Jackson and some of the other football players and the worlds fastes man and women run up steep hills and the parachute method. I am training my daughter for track and I use the hill and the parachute method. All it is is stamina. AND your mind. \n                Have you been giving your body plenty of rest? Without rest it won't really matter how intense the training. You'll only defeat the purpose. When you do a set with weights you need to allow your body 1 whole minute to regain oxygen and supply it to the torn down muscles. When you run you need to mix up the speed. Airbourn shuffle at the beginning then gradually work it up then back down to the Airbourn Shuffle again. Then the next work out you work it backwards. It gives your body a shock an da variety. But again you need to get plenty of rest. How are you eating? That is a diet that you need to see a dietricionist for. ADVICE; Don't do the Adkins diet for runners and track people. It takes away the water intake and you dehydrate the body. Matter of fact I think that diet should be banned. \n                 Other than that you need to experiment with yourself and see what works for your body and what doesn't.

I am speaking as a mother of one and do not get child support.My sons father has him half the time and provides everything he needs when he is with him. My husband on the other hand has a son and the mother took him and moved away because he didn't want to be with her.My husband has ALWAYS taken care of his son.He gave her money voluntarily and still paid for stuff on the side for him. Now she filed child support and has been awarded $400 a month for one child! how rediculous is that. If child support is suppose to be fair then they are telling us it takes $800 a month to take care of this child? Thats BS! Unless your childhas special needs or is ill it does not take even 400 a month to take care of one child. She has no rent cause she lives with her dad and my husband paid for both cars she has. Why do they have these men solely paying for these kids? What is the mothers responsibility? What does she pay for? ; child support is not a magical number that the judge pulls out of his butt.  child support is based on the income of the mother, the income of the father etc.  the state has a chart and depending on what the father makes a figure is computed. in other words x+y=z.  unfortunately i see alot of cases come through my court where the father is the one 99% of the time paying child support.  and even worse the state does not factor in if the father has a mortgage, utilities, food expenses etc.  it sucks big!  i get so angry sometimes in court, but we have to maintain our proffessionalism.  and as soon as these women find out that the father has obtained a second job, they petition the court for more money because he has more income.  I had a case last week that was just absolutely insane.  the man was a capt. in the army and he was ordered to pay alimony, child support, and maintain the mortgage on the house that she got during the divorce and he no longer resides in.  in the end with all the money he was paying out to her, she ended up receiving more of his income than he did.  I have even had many men blatently tell the judge that they would rather go to jail than to pay.  I think in regards to reaching what amount he or she should pay, the state should take into considering what he/she pays out in living expenses and then factor child support. unfortunately the state feels that if you have to live under a bridge they don't care as long as they pay.  you can always repetition the court and present your case and see if they will lower his support amount.",689

9,"What causes people to commit a crime? ; I'm wanting to know because i have to do a speech for school on crime rates and i was just wondering why a person would commit a crime. Any sort of crime in my books is wrong no matter what your reason is. ; It can be a combination of things, and in most real cases it is.  Poverty, upbringing, financial status, social status, can all have a push or pull when some one is deciding on commiting a crime.  In most crimes most people have a well structured plan of what they were going to do, which means that it wasn't some spur of the moment thing.  For example I did a case studie on Drug related crimes: selling, production and so forth.  Over 40 percent of the criminals admited that it was easier for them to sell and produce drugs than it was to actually go and get a paying job.  Now that can be considerd a social upbringin or classification.  \n\nFor some people crime is a way of life, Little Rock Arkansas has the highest rate of gang killings in the US Higher than LA, Okland, and New York.  There was a documentary that showed that little kids were raised up in gangs, hanging round drugs, sex, and crime.  It wasn't a case of these children choosing to joing the Crypts of the Bloods it was that they were raised in the enviorment.  Additionaly to the gang enviorment these children were raised in poverty, the social sturcture was messed up from the beginning weather it was parenting, education, and so on.  \n\nThen you have those that do it for the thrill of doing it.  Take for example kids killing for fun.  I forgot what show it was (was on A&E) but was over kids killing other kids for fun. 4 out of the 5 killers that were intervied said they wanted to know what it felt like to kill.  Now most of these kids were brought up living the american dream: mom, dad, house, minvan, dog, but yet these kids wanted to kill.  Now dose the killings that these kids in any way diffierent from the killing of those raised in gangs, no they were killing, but their social, education, and other aspects were worlds apart.\n\nso in short its can be alot of things that will push a person to commit a crime, weather it be petty thieving to premptive murder.",717

9,"Parrot talk!  Who taught some- that Americans won't do menial labor? ; Where does this idea come from? Many are maids, farm workers, construction, lawn-its not just the people from Mexico. A guest work pass is fine if companies need more. It would would not drain our system (Aid, schools,housing on them)We need to help the people in our own nation-who need Health-food-housing- its millions (look on web).It seems many do not care about them-so they want them to suffer because of aid to others-what kind of Justice is that? And that excuse is very old. Everyone feels for the poor-but we don't trample on others-so others can get more. Hello- there is not enough money for everyone-it is not an endless pot. If those who want to help others-start a fund. I am not going to see others hurt in your so called humanity efforts that effect other here already. And it does effect them! Educate yourself and quit repeating mindless words. ; The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea",731

You need to have fresh stool samples examined for ova (eggs) and parasites.  Find the lab in your area which can actually do this, and ask when they want it.  Take them a fresh sample.  And repeat this several days in a row.  One sample may not show it, and another one will.  This way you can get a diagnosis of the type of worm, and get the right medicine to take to kill them.

8,"WHAT does LOVE means IS it A true FEELING???????? ; I am agirl and iam bit confused about this ; Love is truly a feeling, but that feeling is not always truly love. this is an excerpt from an article I wrote on this subject.\n\nWhen we look at the subject of love and romance, we all come to it with our own pre-set ideas on what it means. And often this is contrary to what God says about the subject. While the Bible does not give a set pattern or prescribe a certain way of doing things, there are a number of principles found throughout the Bible, which we can take and apply to our various mindsets and preconceptions.\n\nWhat we need is a renewing of the mind through the washing of the water of the Word of God. Most of us never even think to question the way things are around us, but the truth is that when the gospel of the kingdom comes, it will clash at times with the way things are and challenge the status quo. Are we willing to stand up for what is right and say that the way things are is not the way they should be and advance the kingdom of God in our own hearts and lives? Are we willing to challenge our brothers and sisters to walk in a manner worthy of our calling as saints of the living God and not submit to the pattern of this world? (Rom. 8:29, 12:1-2) This is not something that you can be convinced of (even though it is true), but something that comes as a revelation from God. Are you willing to allow God to give you His perspective on this subject? (Pray here for the Holy Spirit to give revelation.)\n\nThis is a subject largely untouched by our Christian teachers today. And I believe one reason is that most have never thought about it deeply, and another is that people don’t really want to hear it. John 3:19-21 speaks of people who saw the light, and preferred to continue in darkness because they loved what they were doing and didn’t want to change. However, as the people who bear the very name of Christ, we must come into the light so that our deeds may be seen to be of God. In 2 Tim. 4:3-5 Paul warns Timothy that people will hire teachers who teach things that tickle the ears and don’t produce lasting change, because they don’t want to be confronted with the truth, and not to let that keep him from teaching what is true.\n\nOne of the major strongholds I see in our (Western) culture is what I have termed “Romance”. This is often mistaken for love, and is commonly made the focus of almost all our efforts in the process of determining who we want to date/marry. Dean Sherman sometimes calls this our “date-ability”. I want to give you a few little guidelines for how to tell the difference between love and romance. Please understand that this is not the dictionary definition of romance, and in the right context romance is one of the greatest of all the gifts God has given us, but I could not find any other English word that came closer to expressing the idea I want to convey. Romance (in the commonly accepted sense) is absolutely necessary for a life-long relationship, and one of the great joys that offset the sufferings of love, but you cannot build a lasting life together on romance alone. Love will develop all the good qualities of romance, while rejecting the selfish ones and in the end be more fulfilling. Love is the foundation on which romance must be built. What our culture/society teaches us, and the idea I wish to counter here, is that romance is the foundation on which to build love. I give you the divorce rate in our culture/society: More than 50% the last time I checked. This is possibly the greatest contributing factor for so many marriages failing, although there are many other factors as well. Because as we grow up, we are taught (sometimes unconsciously) that romance should be the primary motivator, and in some cases we come to believe that it’s the only motivator; but romance will simply fade away if it’s not built on the solid foundation of love. Developing romance before love can actually hinder the development of love. \n\nBefore going any further, let me give you my definiti",823

I have some foreign talent candidates that are interested. Is there a service to do this on your behalf or a recommended book to read.? ; Since you are new to this, you should consider retaining an immigration attorney.  The procedure is not rocket science, but requires some interaction with you state's Department of Labor (not to be confused with the U.S. Department of Labor) before you actually file the paperwork with the immigration.  \n\nLegal fees will probably run you about $2,000 per case (I've seen as low is $1,500 and as high as $5,000 with level of service completely uncorrelated to the price; a cheap lawyer can be as good or as bad as an expensive one); you will also have to pay a non-refundable filing fee of $1,500 per case to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service.  There may be other expenses, such as the cost of evaluating your prospective employee's education credentials (the law requires that H-1B workers hold at least a Bachelor's degree in the area of their proposed employment or a related area), but they are typically small compared to attorney fees and filing fees.  \n\nYou will be requried to post a notice to your employees about the fact that you are hiring H-1B workers and sign an affidavit stating that you in fact posted such notice.  \n\nYou should also remember that the best time to file for an H-1B is right after the beginning of the U.S. government fiscal year (October 1), so you should file in October or November.  Usually, USCIS stops accepting H-1B petitions in January or February, because the annual quota for H-1B visas gets filled.  If your attorney neglects to mention this at the initial interview (as some sleazy ones do), don't hire him; he is trying to charge you for putting together a petition that he knows full well will be rejected.\n\nIf you are in California, I can recommend a good attorney (knowledgeable, approachable, and reasonably priced) whom I have repeatedly used over the last few years.",835
3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",836

9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace. Even though the outside world has bestowed upon the boys a sense of morality and order, the danger of savagery remains real even within the context of that seemingly civilized society that has nurtured them.",842

2,When i have sex with my wife i usually come within 30 seconds? ; When i have sex with my wife i usually come with in 30 seconds and then we usually never try the second time.\nCan you guys really help me how to solve my problem ; Did you practise holding back when you masturbated growing up. Basically every time I masturbated growing up I'm practising holding back and recognizing the feeling of getting close then backing off. Its just slowing down or slightly changing your rhythm. Its a practise thing. Also pulling out (if slowing down doesn't help) and tapping your glans (tip) against your wife's vagina will stop you from climaxing if you are getting close. (the part facing away from your belly button) Other ways to help prevent climax. Wear a condom. Masturbate relatively often or have sex more often. I have a much harder time holding back if I haven't ejaculated in a while. Experiment with your body in this regard. They also have creams that supposedly delay climax. I've never tried them so I don't know how effective they are. The solution is in here. Good luck.,848

0,"What do you know about Furries or anthropomorphic role players? ; I am just wondering what the general opinions of people on this subject are. By the way, I posted a similar question once and it was removed. I REALLY hope it doesn't happen again. ; An object is ""anthropomorphic"" if it has been given human attributes; these usually include the capacity for rational thought, emotions, and an upright posture. An anthropomorphic animal, therefore is a hybrid that is somewhere between a human and the original species. \n\nExamples of furries abound, and these can surely cement the concept for any readers that stopped to re-read the above paragraphs... Most cartoon characters are furries (e.g. Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Wile E. Coyote, etc.). Many cartoon characters are quite removed from the actual animals; their caracatured forms still retain many animalistic traits, however, and this identifies them as furries. Many comic book characters (e.g. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Omaha the Cat Dancer, Usagi Yojimbo), movie characters (e.g. the Rippers in ""Tank Girl"", Barf in ""Space Balls""), and mascots (e.g. the San Diego Chicken and Smokey the Bear) are also, at a basic level, anthropomorphized animals. Finally, furries are also commonly found in artwork, literature, and mythology (I won't bother to list examples here; I think you've got the idea by now). These are diverse categories, and this is one reason that it is hard to develop a comprehensive notion of what constitutes a ""furry"". \n\nThe diversity of furries is due, in part, to the degree to which they are anthropomorphized. Some characters (such as Mickey Mouse) are modified and humanized to such a degree that they only bear a passing resemblance to the animal from which they were derived. Others, such as Smokey the Bear, still closely resemble an animal in appearance.",863

2,"what is the analysis and interpretation of a dark amber urine? ; urinalysis ; As others have mentioned, one cause is dehydration or simply not drinking enough water. If you drink a lot of water, your urine will tend to be pale yellow. If you take a lot of vitamin C, it will be dark yellow because excess vitamin C is eliminated from your system.\n\nHowever, there may be other reasons for dark amber urine. Try drinking a few glasses of water. Don't drink too much, but a couple of bottles of water should be fine. If your urine becomes lighter, then it's probable that you simply didn't have enough clear fluid in your system.\n\nIf the urine remains dark amber, and/or if you have other symptoms, like pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, pain or tightness in your stomach, aches in your back where your kidneys are located, etc., you should see a doctor.\n\nDark amber urine may also mean you have some blood in your urine.

2,"I am under the Nat'l Health Insurance in Japan. What is the best way to switch to a company in the States? ; I have had two hernia surgeries while in Japan, and I don't feel the problem is cured.  But I am putting off getting it evaluated until I return to the States.  I would like to switch to a program that would cover things that the old program took care of, in the event that I need another surgery.  Will a past problem pose a threat to a new insurance provider?   If so, how can I deal with the issue? ; Are you moving because your company wants you to work in the US? If so, the company probably has a health plan for its US workers. US health care, unlike almost any other nation, has an employer-provided model of health insurance – most insured Americans have health insurance through work. It’s much less expensive than buying it on your own. As for the pre-existing condition, most plans have a 12-month waiting period, or exclusionary period, for such conditions. In addition, some plans exclude hernias in the first six months of a plan – even if you don’t have a history of having hernias – unless it’s an emergency.\n\nSo, your hernia shouldn’t stop you from getting insurance, but you might have to wait until your insurance covers hernia surgery. After the first waiting period, though, you should be fine.\n\nIf you still have questions, try visiting MostChoice.com. It’s a health insurance Web site that has instant online price quotes and plan details. But it also has a network of licensed insurance agents who can answer any health insurance questions you might have. Just fill out a form, review the online price quotes, and within two days agents should contact you to talk about insurance to cover your hernia and how long you can expect to wait until the insurance will help you pay for the surgery. There’s no cost or obligation. Just wait until one of the agents delivers the insurance policy that’s right for you.\n\nYou can visit MostChoice here: http://www.mostchoice.com/health-insurance.cfm\n\nHope this helps,\n\nBarnes @ MostChoice.",885
3,"Need help with a trigonometry homework problem...any takers? ; Angle H is an angle in standard position with point P (-4, 2) on the terminal side. Find sine, cosine and tangent of the triangle (containing point P on the terminal side). \n\n**I guess my problem is I am not so sure exactly what the terminal side of the triangle is (my text book is dreadful) and my teacher basically is no help. I know how to get sine cosine and tangent once I know how to graph the triangle, so I suppose the better question is where is the terminal side of a triangle? ; The terminal side is the ending side of the angle, which always starts on the positive x-axis.  Since P is in Quadrant II, the angle is a 2nd quadrant angle.  If you draw that point, connect it to the origin, and make a right triangle with your segment as the hypotenuse,angle H is the angle with vertex at the origin.  The hypotenuse, by Pythagorean Theorem , is sqrt (16+4) = sqrt(20)\n\nNow you can use SOH CAH TOA to find sine (opposite leg/hypotenuse) = 2/sqrt(20) \n\ncosine = adjacent leg/hyp. = -4/sqrt(20)\n\ntangent = opp.leg/adj.leg = -2/4\n\nYou could then simplify sqrt(20) = sqrt(4x5) = 2 sqrt 5 and cancel if you need to, and rationalize the denominator if you need to.

This is the class that backed Salvador Allende’s coalition before 1973, that suffered the most from the policies of the military regime, and that again turned to left-wing parties after the end of military rule in 1990. Sharply falling real wages—wages calculated in terms of buying power—from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s increased the size of this group. Government policy in the 1990s and early 2000s endeavored to improve the health and education of this neglected part of the population.\n\nThe middle class, largely urban, is extremely varied in incomes, occupations, and interests. It is composed of professionals, teachers and university professors, civil servants, many private employers, and some small merchants, industrialists, and investors. Many members of the middle class benefited from Chile’s rapid economic growth in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Politically, members of the middle class participate in all parties.\n\nSocial mobility has been high in Chile, and upward social movement has been common. The period of military rule in the late 1900s at first appeared to be simply reactionary and traditionalist. But the free-market economic policies that it adopted ultimately led to increased social mobility.",934

3,"what are the guide of supplication pls answer me now i need a assignment pls..? ; pls help me plsss.... ; Supplication (also known as petitioning) is the most common form of prayer, wherein a person asks a supernatural deity to provide something, either for the person who is praying or for someone else on whose behalf a prayer of supplication is being made.\n\nIn Christianity, the prayer of supplication for health by and on behalf of the sick is referenced in early Christian writings in the New Testament, especially James 5:13-16. One example of supplication is the Catholic ritual of novena (from novem, the Latin word for ""nine"") wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days. This ritual began in France and Spain during the Middle Ages when a nine day period of hymns and prayers led up to a Christmas feast, a period which ended with gift giving. A contemporary Christian example of supplication is the practice of the Daily Prayer for Peace by the Community of Christ where a member prays for peace each day at a specified time.\n\nIn Islam, the Arabic word duˤā (plural adˤiya) is used to refer to supplications. Adˤiya may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, Persian and Turkish. In Islam, duˤā tends to mean personal prayer. Muslim prayer beads usually have 33 or 99 beads to represent God's many names.\n\nThe concept is perfectly at home with secular use. The supplicant may also be described as a suppliant but the former word is more commonly used. The key meaning is of a request by the lesser person in an acknowledged unequal relationship",936

3,"Chemistry homework help, Dimentonal analysis for moles and atoms in amounts of sodium. HELP!? ; Its for a chemistry project, I need help, my teacher hasnt been in class for the last week, so I have absolutely no idea what ""mol"" is.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n1. Cut out 3 nutrition facts labels from three different foods. One should be high in sodium compared to the others.\n2. Look for the total grams of ""Sodium"" per serving.\n3. Using dimensional analysis, show haow many moles and atoms of sodium you are eating for one serving.\n4. How many servings of food would you have to eat in order to reach the maximum daily recommended amount of sodium.\n\nIve got the three labels, they are:\n\n1. Frozen Waffles - 480mg of sodium - 20% daily value\n2.Gatorade - 110mg of sodium - 5% daily value\n3.Juice - 35mg of sodium - 1% daily value. ; To get the no. of moles of sodium in each serving, you must use the equation: no. of moles = mass / relative molecular mass\nThe realtive molecular mass of sodium (Na) is 23 (from periodic table of elements) \nSo for the waffles, the 480mg must first be converted to grams. There are 1000 mg in 1g so there are 0.480g of sodium in the waffles. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in the waffles is:\nno. of moles = 0.480g / 23g = 0.02moles\n\nFor the gatorade, the 110mg is converted to grams also, which is 0.110g. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in gatorade is:\nno. of moles = 0.110g / 23g = 0.0048 moles\n\nLikewise for the juice, the 35mg is converted to grams which is 0.035g. The no. of moles of Na in this is:\nno. of moles = 0.035g / 23g = 0.0015moles\n\nTo find the amount of atoms of sodium in each of the samples we use the following equation:\nno. of atoms = no. of moles x 6x10^23 x no. of atoms per entity\n\n(6x10^23 = Avogadros constant)\nno. of atoms per entity = 1 (because there is only one atom of Na in Na)\n\nTherefore, in the waffles the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.02 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 1.2x10^22\n\nFor the gatorade, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0048 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 2.88x10^21\n\nFor the juice, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0015 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 9x10^20\n\nFinally to find out how many servings you would need to get your full recommended daily allowance (RDA), you must do the following:\n\nWaffles: 0.48g is 20% of your RDA\n               0.024g is 1% of your RDA\n               2.4g is 100% RDA\n               Therefore you would need 2.4g / 0.48g = 5servings\n\nGatorade:0.110g is 5% of your RDA\n                0.022g is 1% of your RDA\n                2.2G IS 100% of your RDA\n                Therefore you would need 2.2g / 0.110g = 20servings\n\nJuice: 0.035g is 1% of your RDA\n          3.5G IS 100% of your RDA\n          Therefore you would need 3.5g / 0.035g = 100 servings\n\n\nHope Ive been of help to you!!!\nIf you've anymore questions just ask!",953

WHAT IF TECHNOLOGY  BECAME SO ADVANCE THAT IT COULD READ THOUGHTS ? ; It isn't a question, but three.\n\n-  What if people were (misspelling) so completely controlled by a powerful government (I can't understand the rest WHAT is like everyone else)?  Maybe you mean that everyone would be like everyone else?\n\nThe simple answer is Communism, a failed political and economic system.  The system fails because it doesn't encourage competition or development.  With complete government control all resources would be divided by the government or used for their projects.  There is always a limit on resources, not everyone in the US can get a cell phone, a big screen TV, and HDTV service.  Some people just can’t afford it all.  So some people have to do without.  Who determines how much of a resources is needed for a task.  If a building required all the available wood in the region then it would be sent there, but since the boss likes to make birdhouses he takes some for himself.  So what happens to you when you can’t get the wood to build your doghouse, or to repair your own house?\n\nAnother big problem is that since there are always shortages in a non-perfect supply system it encourages corruption.  In the above situation the boss might save some wood for you in return for sexual favors, is that fair?  There are only so many doctors available, so who would decide which one gets treatment?  The people in power would get the best health care and those who were not in power would have to make do with the rest.  All the best equipment and medicines would be transferred to those hospitals with the result of people dieing, when they could have been saved.  Is this fair, well if you are a family member of one of the rulers then it would seem fair to you?  Who would decide?\n\nIt is impossible to make everyone just like everyone else.  If you do that then the smart people would have to acts less intelligent, while the less intelligent would be responsible for more than they can handle.  How do you change everyone’s looks, say goodbye to beauty; everyone would look just the same.  If a government had this power then they would make all redheads and all blondes dye their hair black or brunette.  What happens to those with perfect vision?  Most people don’t have perfect vision, it deteriorates with time and eventually some people won’t be able to get it corrected to 20/20.  So what do you plan on doing?  Do you make everyone wear glasses so their vision will all be downgraded or upgraded to the norm?  What about the blind, or do you just kill them all off?\n\n-  What if all competition was removed from society?\n\nAgain communism is the simple answer.\nAnother good answer is illustrated by the TV Show (PBS) Guns, Germs and Steel.  The reason why most primitive societies haven't advanced as far as others is because they didn't need to.  The pressures of their environment are less so they don't need to improve things.  When all you have to do for breakfast is go outside and chuck a spear then why invent a supermarket, and all that is required to build it?  Why bother to invent a brass spear or even a rock knife if you didn’t need it?\n\nCompetition forces advancements and development (as per Darwin's theory of Evolution).  Without competition the species stagnates and eventually dies.  Why run the race when you can’t win, why bother to enter the race at all?  The points on Yahoo Answers don’t mean very much, but most people like to gather points for bragging rights.  If there wasn’t a point system then why bother to answer any questions, or ask them?  Competition is basic to what we do and how we live.  Viruses compete against the body’s immune system.  When your body defeats a virus then it keeps immunity to that virus for a very long time.  Once you get Chicken Pox then you are immune to them.  Without that competition you could get infected every single time you are exposed.  The same is true in our society competition is needed to improve.\n\n-  What if technolo",961

8,"How do I leave my abusive husband after 17 years when I have 2 girls and one still has 2 more years of school? ; Is it best to leave the high schooler with the bigger salary or take her with me when my income is less than adequate? The physical abuse is on and off, but there is daily emotional abuse.  The physical abuse is not enough to leave marks due to their history in law enforcement, just enough to tear muscle and disable me so I can't leave and support myself.  They also get their family members to emotionally abuse me and make me feel less than human whenever I see them.  Even my own girls sometimes make fun of me to the point where it doesn't seem worth living anymore. Where can I go for help?  I called a hotline after they choked me enough to the point I couldn't breathe one time, no help given. Tried the police and they seemed annoyed that I bothered them.  The husband won't let me speak to a primary care physician about the depression because (their name would come up) so I am stuck with nowhere to turn at the moment. I just can't think of where to go for help without being shot by him ; Honey, the best thing you can do for your children is to leave this man regardless of their school situation.  Teens make friends easier than you would think.  But don't even consider leaving one of your children with this man, with you gone, who do you think the violence will turn to.......your daughters.  \n\nI would suggest calling the Dept of Social Services in another county if you don't trust your county and tell them the whole story and they can help you out of the situation.  Battered womens shelters are every where and you need to locate one quickly, because they can and will help you.  They will give you courage and strength where you cannot find any now.  \n\nPlease make the phone calls.  Your life is at risk here.  I know.  My babysister was beaten to death and burned by an abusive boyfriend 5 years ago.  She was five months pregnant.  She knew he would kill her eventually, she stated as much, but she would not take the steps to get out and we could not force her to.  Well, one night he got mad, they argued and he beat her to death then had a friend set fire to her body............he has never been punished and never will be because his friend is his aliby.......\n\nI recently went to view the pictures of her body and of my unborn nephew and let me tell you, if you could see them, you would leave and never look back because IT CAN BE YOU, IT IS NOT ALWAYS 'THE OTHER PERSON.'  She was 28 years old and absolutely model beautiful, burned away.........don't let that happen to you, ok.\n\nSo, ya see, if you feel he will kill you, then God is giving you an instinct of self-preservation and I want you to listen to that instinct and get out of there.  Make your plans and don't discuss them with your daughters, for they will tell.  Call DHHR and a Womans Shelter.  I beg you to leave and take your children with you!!!!!!!!  I will pray for you!!!!!!!!\n\nYou can do it! don't doubt it.  I divorced my hubby of 15 years, 5 years ago.  In the military stationed in Hawaii.  I left that island with the clothes on my back and my daughter right beside me and it was tough, really tough, but you can make it....your girls will need counseling though and so will you due to the abuse.\n\ntake care",979

0,"What's with those air dryers in bathrooms instead of paper towels!!!? ; Does anybody else hate the air hand dryers????  They don't even hardly work and it takes forever to even get your hands remotely dry after washing your hands.  Why do so many places have air dryers instead of the paper towels?  Is it because they're cheap sh_ts and it saves them money not having to buy paper towels?  I don't know but I hate the air dryers, does anybody else feel the same? ; it's better for the environ I suspect. I think it's gross because ppl don't even wash their hands, just wet them. Then they push the button to ""dry"" them and then go open the door with their still wet and germ infested hands... so then the next person to open the door touches the nasty wet door handle. The most sanitary way to do it would be to have paper towels and a trash can by the door so ppl can open the door while holding their paper towel and then tossing the paper towel in the trash can, that way there is no skin to door handle contact to spread the germs.",988
2,"Ladies, what is the longest you ever had to pee for? ; Ladies, you ever been in an important business meeting, watching a movie, driving in the car or just didn't have time to go use the bathroom.  What was the longest amount of time you had to wait until you could finally pee?  How long did you have to pee for when you finally did get relief?  I went hiking last week and thought that I could wait until I got back to the rest area that we started from.  Well, after 2 1/2 hours and two 16oz bottles of Propel, I finally had to just give in to natures call.  I squatted down and peed like I never peed before.  Next time, I will not wait so long as it was not comfortable walking with a VERY full bladder. ; Well after a long night of drinking, or was it morning time?  Anyways......I was able to write in the snow : Have a Merry Chirstmas and a Happy New Ye......and thats where the pee stopped.   Not sure how long it took, cause it was hard to run along and pee and time it all at the same time.  \n\nThe sad thing here is I am not joking.... geesh I am sad.",989
9,"Imagine you are in Grade school again...? ; Also imagine that there are about 20 kids in your class and 8 of them a bullies and cause problems for everyone.  YOu are the biggest strongest kid in the class. Would you take action against they bullies when they are roughing up the weaker kids? \n\n\nSimilarly should the United States act in the same way? (protecting weaker countries and peoples from hostiles) ; Violence as a solution to any problem should only be a last resort. In a perfect world there would be no war, but we do not live in a perfect world. The United States cannot police the whole world it is just unworkable and unrealistic. The problem in the way we choose our fights. Wars we engage in are the ones where we perceive a vital national interest rather than a humanitarian one. Iraq is a good example. While there is a humanitarian side of the conflict, we would not be there if the country did not possess a large oil supply. Oil is central to the US economy and therefore represents a vital national interest. Compare this with Dafur. A terrible genocide is occurring there, but honestly speaking they have nothing we want. The optimum world military situation would be one where nations acted together against tyrants, but unfortunately political realities do not allow for this.",990
4,"Why are there so many Nigerian Scammers on the yahoo chatlines? ; I have been victimized by a Nigerian Scammer in Lagos, he called himself, Anthony Adekunle or antiwaye001. He asked me to receieve certain items through mail that he or someone had ordered online from a random store online, and I would unpack and reship them to his Nigeria Address. I come to find out that he was using my name and address to order online merchandise with stolen or fake credit cards, and everything was linked to me. This was bad, and ended up reporting him to the FBI. I was helping him for not reasons what so ever, but to be kind, because he explained in the most sincere way that he was a christian and that he needed help, so like a good Christian, I believed him and trusted him, until my wife found out about what he really was doing. Many Americans get suckered and fooled by these smart scammers. I met Anthony Adekunle in the Yahoo Public  Christian chat room, so be weary with whom you chat with and if they start to ask for favors, then you better iggy them or spam them ; thanx for the Advice, i always new there are ""Evil"" people out there, but we all have to be careful with who we really interact with them. if you get sespicous about something you must attack him/her with honesty. thanx again",991

1,"Is there dwarfism in turtles? ; Okay here's why I asked this: I've been enjoying catching and releasing turtles since I was a little girl. My friends, family and I started a tradition wear we'd paint their plastrons with unique symbols made from nail polish, so we'd recognize them if we'd catch 'em again. Some markings last longer than others. Besides natural wear, I figured that some lasted longer than others because if the turtle was still growing bigger, it's shell would get bigger and stretch the nail polish making it crack off. This one Blanding's turtle we've been catching for over the past five years and his markings are still there! He's obviously done growing. But there's this one little painted turtle I caught this year that's no bigger than it was last year, and the marking looked as new as it did last year. But the turtle looked pretty little and looked like it should have grown some. Maybe it's a ""midget"" turtle? ; cool question!\n\nno reptiles do not suffer from dwarfism in the true sense that humans do \n\nbut they can have retarded or stunted growth due to stress or poor food etc either when they are in the egg or subsequent to that",997
0,"Using ""had had"" in english - is it ok or just bad grammar that has become excepted? ; for example taken from the NZ herald:\n\n""....active surveillance and robust peer intervention among high risk groups such as female sex workers had had an impact in the south."" \n\nnote the part ""...had had an impact in the south.""\n\nAlthough people use this all the time surely only one ""had"" could have done the trick! ; It's a shame the asker didn't include more of the surrounding text from this article so it could be analyzed more closely.  \n\nAnyhow, grammarians will concur that the structure:  \n\n""...active surveillance and robust peer intervention among high-risk groups such as female sex workers had had an impact in the South..."" ,\n\nIS, technically, correct.  Sacramento Dweller was correct in identifying this seemingly awkward grammatical structure as a matter of tense.  Sentences utilizing this particular structure generally fall under the category of ""Conditional Sentences.""  Sentences featuring the 'had had' syntax are classified as ""The Third Conditional,"" or ""Conditional Type Three,"" and can generally be diagnosed by analyzing them for similarities with following structural formulae:\n\n(The Type 3 Conditional / Third Conditional Formula:)\n\n"" IF + <insert past perfect tense verb> + <insert perfect conditional tense verb> = RESULT OF SUPPOSED CONDITIONS.*\n\n*~NOTE:  RESULT(S) of the supposed conditions usually resemble one of the following two structures, depending on when events occurred:  \n\n(1.) Result:  <insert simple present or past tense verb to express an obvious, or predictable fact / outcome>\n\n(2.) Result:  <insert modal verb  + simple present or past tense verb to express a known fact / outcome >\n\nEXAMPLE #1:  ""If you had had proper training as an assassin, we would not be in this situation...""\n\nEXAMPLE #2:  ""If I'd had proper training as an assassin, you probably wouldn't be here to complain.""\n\n(Notice how in EXAMPLE #2, the contractions 'I'd' is used instead of saying, 'I had had' to illustrate the terms of the condition being discussed, though still allowing the reader to ascertain and understand the time-frame and sequence in which events occcurred?)\n\nRules for proper usage of the ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure state that the structures are 'to be used when talking about unreal, or ""hypothetical"" situations occurring in the past.'  That means, the related events DID NOT 'ACTUALLY' HAPPEN in the past.  Sentences utilizing this structure are almost always phrased to reckon, ""If circumstances were different, what could / would have this been like?""  \n\nThe expression of time / tense in this [third] variety of conditional sentence structure IS identified as the past, and indicates that an action was completed ""in"" the past.  The condition and / or result, therefore, cannot logically be fulfilled because the action in the ""IF"" clause never actually happened.  Action in ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure is almost ALWAYS characterized by the quality of being absurd, and impossible to achieve.\n\nTense and Terminology?\n\n-Simple Present Tense:  Expresses a fact, habit/routine, or ability.\n\n-Simple Past:  Implies that the action happened before and is not happening anymore.\n\n-Past Perfect (Pluperfect) Tense:  Relates that an action or event ended prior to another action or event.\n\n-Present Perfect (Continuous) [Past-composite] Tense:  Indicates either events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Perfect (Conditional) Tense: Relates varying degrees of certianty or uncertainty about events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Modal Verbs:  incorporated with other verbs to illustrate the notion of possibility, impossability, necessity or other degree of probability.",998
