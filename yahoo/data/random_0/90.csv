0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25
7,"Why does everyone who makes a ""how much do you know about Naruto"" quiz on quizilla, think they know all about ; it?   This is a question my son wants answered:D ; This happens because there are Naruto fans that they know almost everything there is to the animation series, but in reality, the actual Japanese companies: Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo, Aniplex, and TV Tokyo Music, who have created the series really know everything about the series.\n\nThere are lots of Naruto fans out there and some even live on the shows when they are released. When an individual makes a quiz, they just want to compare their knowledge with other people who are also fans to Naruto. \n\nThere can even be times when the person making the quiz is wrong on some facts. However, they just guess and make questions out of them. It is only their opinion of who is right or wrong. Unless a person has analyzed every aspect and every episode of the Naruto series, a person will not be able to know everything about it. \n\nThose who make the quizzes probably do know a lot about the anime series, but I doubt they know everything. The basic truths of the human mind can only go so far.\n\nQuizilla is a place that people make quizzes to test others' abilities or are bored and have enjoyment while creating their own quiz. I don't recommend the site if you want to learn more things that others have already learned. \n\nAll and all, confidence is the key idea that we should be looking at in the person making the quiz. There is no other solution.",28

1,"weather question? ; Why has it been so cold in the Northeast?? It was warm for a while, like back in March, and now it is cold again (like 60's and 70s). it is June it should be much warmer than this for this time of year. \nWill it ever get warm again?? Why is the weather like this? I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.  Give it a couple of days, and it'll get warmer.\n\nQuite frankly, though, I prefer weather in the 60s and 70s.  It's just about perfect.",78
4,"Does my computer have an Intel chip? ; I recently bought a Mac Powerbook G4 with 10.4 OS 10.  I heard that the newer Macs now use Intel chips.

6,"how to make friend easier and more natural? ; to make friends ; Talking is probably the largest factor I can think of.\n\nTo keep the other person interested in a conversation don't talk about yourself too much. Ask questions to get to know the person better, talk about any interests you have, classes, guys/girls, parents, etc. Becoming genuinely interested in the other person.\n\nA somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn't like. Generally the other person will complain too and you'll have you're conversation. You have to be Very careful not to do this often because you don't want the other person to think you're a whiner.\n\nPay Attention to what the other person says! This one is Extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered.\n\nContinue to speak to everyone you know regularly. If you are walking and see someone you haven’t talked to in a while, stop for a moment and talk to them. It does not have to be a long conversation, just say hello, see how they are doing and if anything is wrong. You would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them.\n\nBe nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note. You don't have to make sure the other person has a great time Every Single conversation, but you don't want to think of all the petty arguements they've had with you.\n\nArguements... Don't. There are VERY few 'good' arguements. ""The only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it.""\nIf you're wrong, admit it.\n\nDO NOT critize the person, or a friend, when talking to the person. If you want to point out something they did wrong, try to point out something similar you did wrong.\n\nSmile! Not a forced smile, the person you're talking to will be able to tell the difference. And you don't have to be an overly happy hyper-active person. Just smile naturally and, if you can, be somewhat happy. Remembering good times with your friends/family can help.\n\nLet the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener. (Somewhat stated in my first advice, ask questions, talk about interests the other person has. Answer questions sincerly.)\n\nHonestly make the person you're talking to feel important. You don't want to fake this one or do it too often, but if you honestly think they did something well, give them that praise.\n\nIf you want more advice, there are a couple good books that Will actually help. How to Win Friends and Influence People, is probably one of the best ones. It's an old book, but trust me, it's just as useful today as it was when it was written.",93

6,"did you ask for your last raise, or was it offered to you? ; have you ever been turned down for a raise? ; My raises are automatic, either annually or with a promotion, and they are based on a standard forumula with levels and market based standards for the job.  I like it that way!  I HATE to ask for money.\n\nI had a really bad experience in my last job, which was 10 years ago.  I felt that I was doing double what my manager, basically doing his management job for him, and was getting paid very little.  I went and asked for a raise, and was YELLED AT and belittled by the owner of the company.  He said ""HC, I can tell what kind of person you are.  Always looking over your shoulder for another dollar and you'll never be satisfied that you're being paid what you're worth.""  I found another job ASAP after that, where I'm happy to report that I make three and a half times what I was making when I left there.  They were taking advantage of me, and trying to make me believe they weren't.  That's abusive behavior.  \n\nIf you're in the market for a raise, good luck!!  If you think you're worth more, you're probably right.  Go for it, and if somebody tries to make you feel guilty about it -- don't wear it!!!",112

0,"Your religion and population? ; I always wandered what drives people that live poor, in lack of health, food, infrastructure,..., to have many children. I know sometimes it is religion, but I would like to dig deeper here. I know it is also poverty, lack of knowledge, lack of education on contraception, so I am focusing on religion and its role. An example (due to the sensitivity of the issue, I will not state the country): religious people do not work here, do not pay taxes, and live really in modesty, many times in hunger. But their religion tells them to have many children, therefore many of religious families have more than 8 children - who live poor, in lack of food, lack of proper education,... I do not understand this. I myself love children, would love to have 4, but do not have job, I am 28, therefore I do not want to have my first child yet. Even if my religion is telling me 'children are a gift from God', I am sorry, but to me it is not responsible to have them yet or to have many. ????? ; I agree with you, I often wonder, in Africa for example where christianity is rising, why the pope still claims contraception is wrong when encouraging it would help stabilize the countries HIV/Aids epidemic and could also help the countries economy in the long run - having less children means the children they have are better fed, they can afford some sort of education as they have a couple of children to send to school. These children once educated could get better jobs and the cycle carries on. \nIf I was living in poverty I wouldn't have so many children as it is selfish - having them just because you want so many and your religion tells you to do so. They can not provide for them and it is cruel to the children who suffer starvation and a slow painful death in the name of religion.",131
9,"Is this an example of expoiting another countries resources? ; Item: Mexican ambulance drivers are transporting hospital patients unable to pay for medical care in Mexico to facilities in the United States. They know that the federal Emergency Medical Act mandates that U.S. hospitals with emergency-room services treat anyone who presents themselves for care, including illegal aliens. The ambulances are driving through unguarded portions of the border with ""little resistance"" at the instruction of Mexican officials.\n\nhttp://www.americanpolicy.org/more/mexicaninvasion.htm ; Yes, it is exploiting another country's resources.  The question then is whether it is an unfair exploitation.  After all, we are talking about ambulances and people in emergency situations.  If we can save a life by allowing this, I'm for it.",136

Protists include all microscopic organisms that are not bacteria, not animals, not plants and not fungi.\nMost protists are unicellular.

6,"has anyone dealt with the Carlton Financial Group? They loan to less than perfect credit.

From what I know of them they deal with commercial finances such as acquisitions and mergers.  It sounds like your dealing with the company on an individual, personal basis.\n\nI can't comment on CFG but they are regulated by the Financial Services Agency (FSA) which is the UK government's regulatory organisation that sets minimum standards and ensures that all financial firms comply with all necessary legislation etc.\n\nSo to answer your question - yes they are real but I'm wondering if the company you're referring to is a different one.\n\nYou might want to post another question giving specific information about why you're wanting a loan, does anyone know of a company that could help someone in your situation, how do you manage debt or something along those lines.\n\nIf I knew a bit more about your circumstances I might be able to offer some suggestions.",183

6,"what are the laws in nh re getting rid of your tenants pets if you only have a verbal agreement? ; We had a 6 month lease with our tenants. It ran out. We never made up a new one.  During this time they asked if they could get a cat.  We said the usual...as long as we dont smell anything etc. We agreed to another cat and a dog with the same stipulations. Now we are going back to a written rental agreement, with their consent, but we would like to have no pets due to the odor that eminates from their apt.  We also live in the same house in the downstairs apt.  Also, their dog continually barks.  Can we specify no pets in the new lease as long as we give them ample time to find a new home for them.? ; Well as an devoted animal lover I would say don't kick them out, HOWEVER!  If there is an odor and the dog barking all the time, I think they are not responsible pet owners and yes you can draw up a new lease and give them 30 days to sign it without the pets, (which I doubt will happen), or move.  Remind them that you said in your verbal agreement as long as you didn't smell them, which you do and the dog is barking all the time.  OR if you want to continued with the same renters and can take the odor and barking, you can always raise the rent for your inconvenience or ask for more of a deposit? for the possible clean up you'll have when they move out.  You would never know I have 2 cats.  Good luck.",213

The J.D. is technically a first-professional rather than a research doctorate, and holders of the degree in the United States do not, by custom, take the title ""Dr."" in formal address or common speech (see below for historical explanation).\n\nIn all 50 states of the United States, graduation from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association satisfies the academic requirements to take the bar examination. While the law school accreditation requirements of the ABA require students to have three years of undergraduate work before being admitted, the majority of American law schools now are members of the Association of American Law Schools, which requires that law school applicants hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university prior to graduation from law school. Most states require a J.D. degree for admission to practice law.\n\nN.B.: JD may mean Joint Degree.",222

How long do I keep the medical tape on before the wound closes on its own? ; The great thing about medical tape is that you don't have to worry about when to take it off.  It will come off on it's own when it is ready.  What you'll start to notice is that the tape will start peeling up around the edges.  Just trim it off with scissors.  Eventually it will fall off.

4,"how do i resolve undetermined externals in C++ ?? ; I am working on a project right now.. and i am getting 1 unresolved external error.. what can i do to fix this? ; There are a few typical reasons for unresolved\nexternals in C++.  \n\nThe simplist cause is that you forgot to link in a\nrequired library.  I'm not proficient with Windows,\nbut on a Unix/Linux/Solaris machine, you can search\nthrough libraries using ""nm"" to find the missing\nsymbol (and then specify that library on your linker\ninvocation).\n\nMaybe the next simplist cause would be that you\nactually are missing a symbol (ie. because of an\n#ifdef or some oversight in your Makefile, some\nsource file didn't compile).  Look for the symbol\nin the source and make sure that file is correctly\ncompiled.  [By the way, it is quite possible that\nyour linker will report ""mangled"" names which\nincorporate the class hierarchy of the type of\nthe symbol.  You may wish to filter your linker\noutput through something to reconstitute the\noriginal symbol name.  On many systems, this filter\nis called ""c++filt"", but I've also seen it called\n""dem"" (as in demangler).]\n\nFinally, in C++, I've seen another cause of unresolved\nsymbols being short-comings in the template instantiation\nsystem.  In the general case, the compilation system\nshould detect the use of templates and create the\nnecessary versions where and when needed, but some\ncompilers provide more limited support.  In those cases,\nit may be necessary to explicitly instantiate the \nmissing template.  Take a good look at the unresolved\nsymbol (particularly if you can ""demangle"" the name)\nto see if it looks like it should be provided by one\nof your (or the system's) templates.  That would be\nthe clue that this is an instantiation problem.",592

4,"What is AJAX? And how does it work? ; Please describe. I have only a vague idea ; Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and\nXML. It is a method by which user’s interaction with  any application happens independentaly of communication with the server. Ajax engine consisting of javascripts gets downloaded on to the browser when a user opens a web page and act as an go between the the server and the user's browser. Every user action that normally would generate an HTTP request takes the form of a JavaScript call to the Ajax engine instead. Any response to a user action that doesn’t require a trip back to the server — such as simple data validation, editing data in memory, and even some navigation — the engine handles on its own. If the engine needs something from the server in order to respond — if it’s submitting data for processing, loading additional interface code, or retrieving new data — the engine makes those requests asynchronously, usually using XML, without stalling a user’s interaction with the application.\n\najax is being used by google for its various services like Gmail,Google Suggest. You must have noticed in Gmail that when you type in the address box you get the address list as suggestions as soon as you type. This is through Ajax",604

Some doctors agree that a borderline personality is hardest to treat because it takes so much to gain the patients trust.  This is because most people with BPD were abused (either sexually, physically, or emotionally) as children.  After the patients trust is gained, the patients and doctor then try to overcome compulsive behavior, a hard thing for any BPD to accomplish.\nAll in all, a borderline personality makes it difficult for others to assist in that they see everything in black and white; a person who is not their hero is their enemy, and can quickly become one or the other.",625

For example, the traffic light and pedestrian light have a 3:1 minute ratio. Let's pretend the schedule starts at 12:00, the traffic light will be green from 12:00 to 12:03. Then the pedestrian light will be green from 12:03 to 12:04. The cycle continues: 12:04-12:07 is Traffic while the pedestrian is 12:07-12:08.\n\nNow I assume the pedestrian traffic light button has like an ""idle function"". For example, maybe if the button isn't pressed after 45 seconds then it becomes idle and the (12:03-12:04 section) will remain the green for traffic light. However, lets say you press the button at 12:05, the pedestrian light will not turn green until 12:07 because pressing the button doesn't change the light but brings it off idle and into the schedule.\n\nNow I didn't research this, it's just my assumption.

1,"Why is there are sonic boom when planes make the sound barrier? ; What causes the sound? ; A sonic boom is the audible component of a shock wave in air. The term is commonly used to refer to the air shocks caused by the supersonic flight of military aircraft or passenger transports such as Concorde (Mach 2.03, no longer flying) and the Space Shuttle (Mach 27, has only flown once since the 2003 crash). Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion; typically the shock front may approach 167 megawatts per square meter, and may exceed 200 decibels.\n\nWhen an aircraft is near the sound barrier, an unusual cloud sometimes forms in its wake. A Prandtl-Glauert Singularity results from a drop in pressure, because of shock wave formation. This pressure change causes a sharp drop in temperature, which in humid conditions leads the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets and form the cloud",732

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",1179

I was highly motivated to quit because I was scheduled for elective surgery and I understood that stopping smoking was the single best thing I could do to increase my chances for a successful surgical outcome.  \n\nResearch has indicated that using nic replacement increases the successs rate of quit attempts.  I had tried to stop cold turkey several times but always fell off the wagon and had given up trying - until my surgery date was looming.  Amazing how that motivates a person!\n\nI never tried this drug but some quitters have also been helped by using the drug Wellbutrin, a prescription medication.  Some have combined it with nic replacement to increase their chance of success.\n\nI guess the best advice I could give is that if you fail, try again.  Every attempt to quit, whether you last a week or a month, gives you useful experience and information about your habit and what smoking does for you that can help you the next time you try.  Don't stop trying.\n\nOn the issue of weight gain, I found that I have a strong oral craving - if it isn't a cigarette in my mouth, then it's food.  With oral nic replacement products (gum or lozenges) there is less likelihood that you'll overeat because the oral cravings are somewhat satisfied by the nic replacement product.  This isn't the case, of course, with the patch.  I didn't gain weight during the time I used nic gum.  I did gain about 10 lbs later.  Unless you eat yourself out of house and home, there is no reason to gain a lot of weight (I don't consider 10 lbs. a lot of weight).  However, if you eat instead of smoking, then yes, gaining weight is likely.  I took up walking instead of smoking.  Anything but eating!",1344

6,"What does someone who studied Medical Assisting do? ; Also...what's the salary range? What kind of jobs can the person apply to? ; Medical assistants perform routine administrative and clinical tasks to keep the offices and clinics of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors and optometrists running smoothly. \n\nThe duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on the location and size of the practice and the practitioner's specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually are ""generalists,"" handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area, under the supervision of department administrators.\n\nMedical assistants perform many administrative duties, including answering telephones, greeting patients, updating and filing patients' medical records, filling out insurance forms, handling correspondence, scheduling appointments, arranging for hospital admission and laboratory services, and handling billing and bookkeeping.\n\nClinical duties vary according to state law and include taking medical histories and recording vital signs, explaining treatment procedures to patients, preparing patients for examination, and assisting the physician during the examination. Medical assistants collect and prepare laboratory specimens or perform basic laboratory tests on the premises, dispose of contaminated supplies, and sterilize medical instruments. They instruct patients about medications and special diets, prepare and administer medications as directed by a physician, authorize drug refills as directed, telephone prescriptions to a pharmacy, draw blood, prepare patients for X- rays, take electrocardiograms, remove sutures, and change dressings.\n\nMedical assistants also may arrange examining-room instruments and equipment, purchase and maintain supplies and equipment, and keep waiting and examining rooms neat and clean.\n\nAssistants who specialize have additional duties. Podiatric medical assistants make castings of feet, expose and develop X-rays, and assist podiatrists in surgery. Ophthalmic medical assistants help ophthalmologists provide eye care. They conduct diagnostic tests, measure and record vision, and test eye muscle function. They also show patients how to insert, remove and care for contact lenses, and they apply eye dressings. Under the direction of the physician, ophthalmic medical assistants may administer eye medications. They also maintain optical and surgical instruments and may assist the ophthalmologist in surgery.\n\nThe earnings of medical assistants vary, depending on their experience, skill level and location. Median annual earnings of medical assistants were $23,940 in 2002. The middle 50 percent earned between $20,260 and $28,410. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $17,640, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $34,130. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of medical assistants in 2002 were as follows:\n\nGeneral medical and surgical hospitals: $24,460 \nOffices of physicians: $24,260 \nOutpatient care centers: $23,980 \nOther ambulatory healthcare services: $23,440 \nOffices of other health practitioners: $21,620",1623

Sacramento Dweller was correct in identifying this seemingly awkward grammatical structure as a matter of tense.  Sentences utilizing this particular structure generally fall under the category of ""Conditional Sentences.""  Sentences featuring the 'had had' syntax are classified as ""The Third Conditional,"" or ""Conditional Type Three,"" and can generally be diagnosed by analyzing them for similarities with following structural formulae:\n\n(The Type 3 Conditional / Third Conditional Formula:)\n\n"" IF + <insert past perfect tense verb> + <insert perfect conditional tense verb> = RESULT OF SUPPOSED CONDITIONS.*\n\n*~NOTE:  RESULT(S) of the supposed conditions usually resemble one of the following two structures, depending on when events occurred:  \n\n(1.) Result:  <insert simple present or past tense verb to express an obvious, or predictable fact / outcome>\n\n(2.) Result:  <insert modal verb  + simple present or past tense verb to express a known fact / outcome >\n\nEXAMPLE #1:  ""If you had had proper training as an assassin, we would not be in this situation...""\n\nEXAMPLE #2:  ""If I'd had proper training as an assassin, you probably wouldn't be here to complain.""\n\n(Notice how in EXAMPLE #2, the contractions 'I'd' is used instead of saying, 'I had had' to illustrate the terms of the condition being discussed, though still allowing the reader to ascertain and understand the time-frame and sequence in which events occcurred?)\n\nRules for proper usage of the ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure state that the structures are 'to be used when talking about unreal, or ""hypothetical"" situations occurring in the past.'  That means, the related events DID NOT 'ACTUALLY' HAPPEN in the past.  Sentences utilizing this structure are almost always phrased to reckon, ""If circumstances were different, what could / would have this been like?""  \n\nThe expression of time / tense in this [third] variety of conditional sentence structure IS identified as the past, and indicates that an action was completed ""in"" the past.  The condition and / or result, therefore, cannot logically be fulfilled because the action in the ""IF"" clause never actually happened.  Action in ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure is almost ALWAYS characterized by the quality of being absurd, and impossible to achieve.\n\nTense and Terminology?\n\n-Simple Present Tense:  Expresses a fact, habit/routine, or ability.\n\n-Simple Past:  Implies that the action happened before and is not happening anymore.\n\n-Past Perfect (Pluperfect) Tense:  Relates that an action or event ended prior to another action or event.\n\n-Present Perfect (Continuous) [Past-composite] Tense:  Indicates either events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Perfect (Conditional) Tense: Relates varying degrees of certianty or uncertainty about events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Modal Verbs:  incorporated with other verbs to illustrate the notion of possibility, impossability, necessity or other degree of probability.",1634

2,"Can I get pregnant after I get off the pill? ; I want to go on birth control pill for contraceptive reasons. But I was on it before (for acne) and it made me really emotional so I got off and I felt better, but after I got off I didn't have my period for 7 months! I want to have babies in about 3 or 4 years, will going on the pill make that chance less? Also, is it better to just stay on or go on and off of the pill? My fiance is in the military so I don't see him that often but when we do well, you know what happens ^_~ Also, what are other side effects of the pill? do different ones do different things? I don't want to gain weight, be emotionally unstable or get acne. ; 1.) Yes, you can get pregnant after coming off the pill. For some women it takes a while for their cycle to return to normal. For some it only takes a few weeks or a month. Talk with your gynecologist to decide what pill will be best for you. \n2.) Remember when starting a new pill side effects can last anywhere from a week to three months so give it a fair go. It is better to just stay on it straight through versus going on and off. Going on and off can seriously whack your body/cycle and emotions out because your body will be constantly having a change in the hormones. And your periods would be all over the place.\n3.) Every pill will affect different people differently. That's why I say check with your doctor. I DON'T recommend the shot(Depo Provera) because some of the more common side effects are constant spotting and weight gain. Also it can take months or even a year after you go off it to have a regular cycle back. You may want to try a low-dose pill because of previous emotional side effects. Something like Ortho TriCyclen Lo or that new Nuvaring(you only have to remember that once a month!).\n\nGood luck.",1671

So if a person wants to go to church, claim Christ as their savior, pray and then turn around and kill somebody, then they just have that choice, God didn't create robots.  You cant associate the personal choices of people with those of all christians.  That's just like saying because a white guy with a beard robbed you, then all white guys with beards are theives.

My university is big on engineering, compsci, and premed, so I see lots of changes of major -- and polisci pops up quite often for people from all three schools. \n\nI personally was a Computer Engineering major, but ended up going ICS and Anthro after about a year and a half of boredom (considerably more EE stuff than I was expecting, and not enough programming).\n\nPhysics is also a popular transfer. Usually people go for whatever they found interesting while they were in engineering. I took a breadth anthro class that I really enjoyed and I also did a great deal of programming in my free time, so I capitalized on those interests and pursued both majors. That was almost two years ago, and now I'm wrapping up anthro this quarter and will probably graduate in just under two years from now with a pair of full majors (a bs and a ba). So if you have multiple interests, don't be afraid to go for multiple majors or minors -- they add on college time (and $$$) but you won't have any regrets. And majors can easily become minors if you lose interest in them along the way, or decide you want to graduate sooner. \n\nUltimately the decision is always a personal one.",2022

3,"finiding distance...? ; (10,20)(13,16)\n\nthankyou ; The numbers you have are two points on a coordinate grid( the one with the x axis and the y axis. If you have some graph paper you could find the points. The first number in each set is the x-number and the second is the y number. You are trying to find the distance between those points. If you drew the dots on graph paper you could make a triangle out of them. One side is the x side and it is 3 units long(13 -10).  One side of the triangle is the y side and its 4 units long(20-16). Connecting those two points makes the third side or hypotenuse of the triangle. \nSo we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance.\nSo its 3squared + 4 squared =9 + 16 = 25.We must take the square root of 25 for the final answer, which is 5.

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",2798

5,"Mortorcycles and the NFL? ; Do you think that after what happened to Pittsberg QB Ben Roethlisberger, The NFL will start putting in the players contracts banning motorcycle riding? Do you think it is right of the NFL to do that? ; here are my vview on things:\nI'm reading through some of the comments about this situation ""I hope it's not serious"", ""gee that's too bad, we hope he'll be all right""...""he's a great player, hope he can still play""... but I can't help thinking ""what a waste.""\n\nHow many of us would love to be living a dream, to be a pro football player, making millions? This kid is already on record as the youngest QB ever to win a Superbowl, he's got his whole life and career in front of him, and he doesn't care to protect all that he has to live for?\n\nOne article I read mentions how players past and present, as well as his coach have appealed to him to reconsider his celebration of freedom in not having to wear a helmet. Fellow Americans presumably equally in support of ""freedom"" yet were also able to consider what he potentially had to lose if he should meet in an accident.\n\nAnd here we are. The article I read said ""injuries do not appear life-threatening."" Will he play again? Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye. He refuses to wear facial protection, and he's out for the first month. Duh.\n\nLike everyone else in the sports world, I join in wishing Big Ben a full recovery. I hope we get to see him continue what many are now confident must be a hall of fame career. Do I feel sorry for him? Sure...but, for crying out loud, at what point do we hold people accountable for taking unnecessary risks? Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street? If we expect kids to make smarter decisions in the interest of their own safety, why is it so easy to make excuses for ""adults""?",3085

The pain was mostly on the RIGHT side of my jaw under my ear  It hurt really bad but got better after a couple of days.  Six days later on November 3rd my cheeks started hurting.

6,"what are the advantages and disadvantages of finance on a personal basis? ; i need information on if britain is becoming a debt ridden society and have to compare adv and dis ad ; The advantage of taking out a loan is that you keep whatever savings or capital that you may have intact, for other investment purposes. This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard. This is a very expensive use of money indeed!\n\nIn the UK, currently, a significant amount of personal debt is financed at high-ish interest rates. This makes the finance companies a lot of money but causes significant losses to the individual borrowing the money.",3137

3,"40 years old and am starting medical school? ; i am worried about my success,what should i expect ; You'll be fine.  My mum went back to nursing school at about 34, she wound up graduating near the top of her class - with a 3.97 GPA.  I didn't manage that on my bachelor's, and I went straight from high school.\n\nMy dad went back and got a COTA certification a few years after that, graduated and had absolutely no problems getting really good jobs.  Both of them had not attended any sort of college since they were 18 and married.  My father, in fact, wound up doing an ""academic bankruptcy"" on most of his classes, since he had things like a D in trigonometry (which he didn't even remember taking!!).  I don't remember his GPA, but it was like mine, somewhere above a 3.5 (but not a 3.97 - my mum set the bar WAY high.)\n\nThey both pointed out a couple of advantages and disadvantages to going back so late - one advantage I remember my mum and dad both mentioning was that when they did get placed in a job, they were able to start at slightly higher pay rates and were placed into supervisory positions fairly quickly due to other experience (ie, my dad did 18 years in the military and had been trained in management techniques which transferred over, etc).  A disadvantage I remember them discussing was that you have a harder time forming study groups and such while you're in class, because a lot of younger students aren't that responsible, although by med school I bet a lot of that's eliminated.\n\nGood luck, you're going to stress over tests, practicals, and clinicals, but don't stress too much, I'm sure you'll do fine.  Older students tend to approach their schoolwork like a job, so you don't run into the issues of missing lecture and such.  :)",3205

No one seems to have a clue and always giving me answers that never make sense. ; Answers to your questions:\n1.  I'm assuming you're talking about how often you should check your credit.  I would say at leat every 6 months.  Checking your own credit will not lower your score.\n\nIf you suspect you're at risk for identity theft, you'll want to check it more often.\n\nIf you are planning to buy a home or car, you'll want to keep a close eye on it, as well.\n\n2.  I've heard conflicting advice on that.  I've heard 2 points each time.  But I don't think that's correct.  If you're applying for credit left and right, you're going to look like you're desperate.  Lenders don't want to see a bunch of inquiries on your credit report.\n\n3.  Call the credit card company and ask.  If you have been a good customer they may be willing to raise your limits.\n\n4.

We want a child desperatly but I am not sure if I can handle the pain after sex much longer.

It was extremely painful and I felt nauseous, but after a few hours I was completely fine.  Ruptured cysts almost always heal on their own, but they're painful and have a small chance of infection.

When I was younger I wore a hellish back brace for 2 1/2 years 24/7. In my case the curvature progressed. Two years ago I had scoliosis surgery. I was 18 and had an ""S"" curve (56 thorasic & 68 lumbar). Dr. Munish Gupta at UC Davis in California was my surgeon. He did a WONDERFUL job! 12 vertebrae were fused and 3 (only looks like 2) titanium rods were put in to straighten my back. It worked! I was so scared of having surgery. Scared of what could go wrong. My fears did have merit as things can go wrong, but if I could go back and do it all again, I would! I now wish I had had surgery sooner. I even LOVE the scar down my back (and the small one from the bone graft on my hip) and gained about an inch in height.\nAnother testament to the fact that the surgery was a success is that fact that as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I do not accept blood transfusions. With a surgery this big one tends to loose blood, but because my surgeon agreed to use bloodless surgery equipment it was no problem! Everything went perfectly. I have also been in two major car accidents since my surgery and nothing broke or was damaged. I also actively ride horses, swim, and do everything I did before the surgery (ok, I do MORE now!).

2,"What to eat post gall bladder surgery.........(HELP!)? ; After just having my gall bladder removed I am finding that what ever I eat causes stomach upset and I was hoping that others who have gone down this path would share what worked for them.\n\nIt was an emergency surgery on March 9th/06. I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922

1,"I want to store electricity generated thru alternative means. how can it be done? how long can i reuse it? ; I am an NGO working for the upliftment of the poor. I have some ideas of my own and before i implement the same, i wanted to have some of my  inquisitives cleared. Hence this post. The electricity generated in small amounts to large amounts have to be stored for later usage. is this possible? if so, how and how long can the stored electricity be made available for usage. once this is answered i have further questions related to this topic and those knowledgeable may kindly help answering the same; for the betterment of our society / humankind. Thanks and Regards - JON ; You can store it in batteries and it lasts as long as the batteries last.\n\nThe sun produces a huge amount of energy every day (173 millions of billions Watts). The amount we receive generates wind (converted into electricity through windmills), heat, photosynthesis of plants and trees and 1.37kw of energy per square metre. This energy can be harnessed by PV cells and converted into electricity. In fact, less than 1% of our planet’s desert areas would generate all the electricity we need if it was covered with PV panels.\nGenerating electricity this way is quite simple: light hits a cell made of a thin layer of silicium over a metal support which generates electrons. The motion of these electrons generates current. PV cells are assembled in panels, generating up to 100w/h of DC power (14v approximately). These panels are connected to a regulator, which controls the electricity production, sends some to appliances, some to battery storage and dumps any excess. PV panels generate electricity when subjected to sunlight. This means they do not produce at night. This is why most systems store electricity in batteries.\n \nHOUSING APPLICATIONS\nA modern house does not require a lot of electricity and it does not seem very efficient to burn diminishing fossil resources in huge plants located far away and then transport this electricity over hundreds of kilometers to houses. By having a few PV panels on the roof, any ordinary house can generate its electrical needs; this power can be supplied in DC (for halogen lighting for example) and AC (220V) through an inverter to power standard appliances.\n \nA house connected to the grid can then sell electricity by day and buy some back at night.\nAn independent house generates all its needs by storing electricity in battery banks. In windy areas, a windmill can be a very good complement to PV systems.\n \nPV systems do not require fuel, have no moving parts that can wear, require virtually no maintenance and last for a very long time (some PV systems have a 30 years warranty).\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\nThey constitute the bulk of the applications today, for remote lighting, transmitters, satellites in space, etc. Industrial buildings could also produce part of their needs through PV.\n \nCOST MATTERS\nIs PV technology expensive? Prices are now going down and make it ever more competitive. PV systems last a very long time and over say 50 years, they should become extremely competitive.\nThe cost of fossil fuels is expected to increase over the next 20 years. Furthermore, fossil fuel generators require heavy maintenance. Another aspect to take in account is the pollution they generate: this has a heavy cost in terms of global warming, poor air quality, health problems and logistic costs (transport of fossil fuels, electricity on high power lines and their waste), not to mention collateral damage such as oil slicks, Chernobyl type accidents, respiratory diseases, chemical runoffs and other nasty results.",3969

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

Digestion of food produces waste gases.  For example, yesterday I got on my bicycle and rode almost 60 miles.. halfway during the exercise, the farting started, and now today it's still happening.. my body may not have yet caught up with refueling the 3000 calories I burned.\nThe excrement might be caused by what you're eating.

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

2,"Milk... cancer? ; I happen to hear this rumor about milk being a cause of Cancer.. I looked it up in google and found quite a few links regarding this... it comes to me as a shock... Is it True?? ; Cow's milk doesn't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe worst part about cow's milk is the process it goes through to get from the cow's udder to your grocery store.   Typically, it is altered beyond recognition.  It is standardized, fortified, pasteurized and homongenized.  In other words, it has been taken apart and put back together again, not always in the same proportions. Then it will be cooked and emulsified.\n\nHowever, many humans actually have mild allergies to the substance, which is nutrionally incompatible with their bodies.  In these cases, milk consumption can trigger acne outbreaks, sinusitis, constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nOn the other hand, those who experience no allergic reactions can drink it with no problems, and will wholeheartedly stand out on the streets and proclaim, ""Milk is good for you!  Drink it by the gallon!""  And for them, it may be.  But it's not for everyone.\n\nSo, what transforms an otherwise  healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens?  It all starts with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass; and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than they a traditional cow.\n\nThen, the cows are given antibiotics to keep them well. Their milk is then pasteruized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed; lactase, which assimilates lactose; galactose, which  assimilates galactose; phosphatase, for the assimilation of calcium. Literally dozens of precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteruization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to disease.\n\nHope this helped explain it a little better.  Raw, organic, whole cow's milk is in no way cancer-causing.  It's really more the process it goes through to become store-ready that could, in a sense, contribute to cancer development in some people.",4966

I agree with 'andytheba..' and 'itschris', above. The line represents the STRING (top line = highest note-thinnest string, bottom line = lowest note-thickest string) \n\nThe numbers DO refer to the fret number (0 = open or un-fretted string/ 1= 1st fret on that particular string 2= 2nd fret and so on and so forth) Where a number repeats ---2-3-5-5-5-5-5--- , this indicates the number of time you pluck or pick the string\n\nTabs are designed primarily to help guide you through a A PIECE OF RECORDED MUSIC YOU EITHER KNOW OR HAVE ACCESS TO. Tabs sometimes, though rarely, contain some musical information. This is similar  to standard musical notation. A large number of tabs, however, just provide you with the basic information and you use the recording to to reference it.\n\nAn example :  ----0-2-3-5--- played on the A string (second fattest) is telling you to play the notes A, B, C and D. If the numbers read ----0-2-4-5--- they would be telling you to play the notes A, B, C# and D.   Since you already read standard music notation - the piano music - you have a glorious head start but, as I said, alot of Tablature (tabs) dispenses with all the note value notation and provides you with just the 'finger pathway' through the music you listen to or want to learn.

I remember watching the movie I am asking about and I know it wasn't a nightmare movie he was real in this movie the whole time. I believe that this movie was based on a true story about a man a long time ago and it is part of what started the freddy movies which is why he is burned and in the first freddy they show a clip of this movie where the people had set him on fire.

Read Total Immersion material. You will be fascinated with your reading.  Also, research your topic on line to find articles about backstroke and freestyle.   Third, working your fast twitch muscles will help you improve time.  As you improve in technique, then -- and only then --practice harder and faster swims each time you get in the water.  Watch the clock and try to improve each week.  Most importantly, have patience with yourself and be less self-critical.  Let go of negative thoughts and stay positive.  A great deal of swimming is mental activity so stay positive.    As you practice new techniques to improve your strokes, you will find yourself improving, getting a better feel for the water.

I catagorised it under women's health but this time will try politics.  I dont believe I can get in trouble with yahoo by using the health term menstrual cycle.  Briefly she made two bad decisions.  One was appointing a man who has had problems with honesty in the past and the second is taking off the Congressional oversight intelligence committe a highly qualified woman and putting on a man who was fired as a judge for giving police information to criminals.  Could she have had severe menstrual symptoms that caused her to make these decisions.

This could be a real problem if we had a woman president because all North Korea would have to do is to fire off a missile and if it happened to be that time of the month for her then she'd just up and nuke them.

Anyone can help me with this, about 200 words because I have only few minutes to talk about this. Thank you very much. ; Try to download the free Visual C# Express 2005 from Microsoft and also check the online documentation of MSDN. \n\nThese are the excerpt from the documentation:\n\n""C# Language\nC# syntax is highly expressive, yet with less than 90 keywords, it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin working productively in C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ while providing powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, anonymous methods and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# also supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code.\n\nAs an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.\n\nIn addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# facilitates the development of software components through several innovative language constructs, including:\n\nEncapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.\n\nProperties, which serve as accessors for private member variables. \n\nAttributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time. \n\nInline XML documentation comments.\n\nIf you need to interact with other Windows software such as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs, you can do this in C# through a process called ""Interop.""

Bush's ""Sanctity of Marriage"" gay marriage constitutional ban. \nGeorge W. Bush's marital problems have just taken another turn for the worse. Apparently, Mr. Bush has not only engaged in an extra-marital affair with a member of the opposite sex who is also a senior member of his Cabinet, but also a member of the same sex. WMR received the following  release this morning from Leola McConnell, Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada (who has been endorsed by WMR). McConnell is a one-time professional dominatrix.\n""President Bush's speech to the nation Monday. If he doesn't say he's a gay American or at the least a bisexual one then he shouldn't be making one at all. And the notion that it would be in regards to writing bigotry into our nation's Constitution is reprehensible. Too bad it isn't me doing the rebuttal because in 1984, I watched him perform (with the enthusiasm of homosexual male who had done this many times before) a homosexual act on another man, namely Victor Ashe. Victor Ashe is the current Ambassador to the nation of Poland who should also come out like former Governor McGreevey of New Jersey and admit to being a gay American. Other homo-erotic acts were also performed by then private citizen George Bush because I performed one of them on him personally. \n\nI am the woman this website (bushssecretlifein84.tripod.com) speaks of that has been posted on the net nearly two years now. None of this would be the business of anyone but President Bush's little ruse to save his failed presidency by using DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] to divide Americans one from the other has to be exposed as the act of a desperate closeted homosexual man. The only crime in being GLBT is in the hiding. The President needs to come clean with the American people about his own past sexual behavior before he tries to besmirch the humanity of people in search of sincerely committing to the same bonds of matrimony he's afforded. He violated his own vows of monogamy having a homosexual affair with a long time family friend of whom his wife had no knowledge. His hypocrisy seems to know no bounds. \n\nI had planned to run for governor of Nevada without going into any of this but his planned nationally televised address to the nation makes it necessary for me to address his attempt at division in as public a way as he picked to try this Bushification of reality regarding same sex marriages.\n\nSincerely,\nLeola McConnell\nLiberal Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada\n --------------------------------------\nNow, aint this special!?",5819

Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

As for gothic culture, being goth has nothing to do with what clothes you wear or music you listen to, it is a way of thinking and seeing the world. The clothes that goths wear and the music that goths listen to is just a reflection of that mindset. Goths see that there is extreme pain and evil in the world, along with the good. Instead of condemning it or ignoring it, goths accept these things as a part of life and try and enjoy the good along with the bad, since they can't stop the bad from happening. They are not obsessed with death, they just accept it as an inevitability. They do not try and cause more pain in their (or anybody else's) lives, since there is plenty to start with.

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.",6246

1,"Ice Skaters? ; Two ice-skaters stand next to each other on the ice.  One skater, with a mass of 80 kg, pushes the other, who has a mass of only 50 hg.  If the pushed skater moves at 4m/s, what is the speed of the heavier skater? ; Hmmm. Lessee... two skaters on slick ice. One, mass 80 kg, pushes the other and, according to Newton, is simultaneously pushed back in the opposite direction while the other, mass 50 kg, goes flying off across the ice at 4 m/s. This is a closed system, right? So where did that 200 kilogram meters per second of momentum imparted to the lighter skater come from? Yikes! Could the heavier skater have acquired the SAME momentum in the opposite direction? Is it possible that, after all this time since Newton, momentum is STILL conserved? Does MV = mv, where M is the mass of the heavier skater, V the velocity of the heavier skater, m the mass of the lighter skater, and v the velocity of the lighter skater? Does (80) V = (50) (4)? Does V = 2.5 meters per second? Nah! Lard butt's extra mass caused their skates to dig into the ice, and created enough friction to slow them down to 0.0025 meters per second... probably.",6598

6,"What is your opinion? ; I live an hour and a half away from work and have to commute every day (Monday - Friday).  It puts a lot of miles and wear and tear on my car, not to mention costs a lot, and takes a lot of time and energy.  I found a house twice as close to work that I am interested in purchasing.\n\nI live with my boyfriend.  I am 19 years old and he is 20 years old.  I have a bit of credit established and he does not at all.  If we are going to purchase this house any time soon (our lease goes up October 1st) it will have to be in my name since I have credit and he does not.\nMy idea is (if I can get pre-approved) that we should go ahead and get the house in my name and put the utilities in his name while he builds credit. Once he has credit built up and/or we are married, we will refinance to put the house in both of our names.\nHis idea is to wait to buy a house until he has established credit.  But in the meantime, it costs me a lot of time, money, and energy to work so far away.\n\nSuggestions? ; I will preface my answer by stating that I am a licensed Realtor® in the state of Arizona.\n\nIt sounds to me like you have your act together even for a person of your age. I commend you for your way of thinking.  \n\nPersonally if it was I and I could make the financing and the payments work I would buy now and start building some equity.  Between the amount you will pay down on the principal on your loan (it won’t be much at first) and the appreciation of the value of your property, you will be able to move into something higher in value in the future.  \n\nI don’t like to get into financing so much as I don’t have the training for it, if you find yourself a good Realtor® and/or lender. They will be able to guide you through the process of getting financing as well as finding the right home for you. \n\nGood luck in your search for your home\n\nP.S.: If your lease is up in October, you will need to get going on the process now, as it usually takes about a month to go through all of the inspections and closing.",6653

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

If you're pissed off about illegal immigration, fine, do something about it: start fining companies that hire illegals huge fines, and the illegal job market will dry up. If you're worried that people don't understand English and won't be able to find a job, then offer free or low-cost English classes at various times and on various days in neighbordhoods where there are lots of immigrants. But stop throwing fits about the fact that some people are able to communicate in TWO languages and choose the language in which they communicate at any point in time based on the context. \n\nGeez...Is it ridiculous to ask for a LITTLE tolerance and common sense?\n\nTO Bluffmike: Dude, your argument makes no sense. So you're saying that in order to avoid becoming like the Chinese, who were able to employ xenophobic, intolerant troops to squelch liberty by killing the protesting Hans, whom they disliked, we should become more intolerant and xenophobic. Does that not seem a little contradictory to you? No, no, no, if we want to avoid the path of the Chinese, we need to encourage TOLERANCE not intolerance.\n\nTo Concerned: Actually, plenty of Americans do move to China and expect to be spoken to in English. My ex-husband travels there all the time and may be transferred there next year. He speaks very little Chinese. Luckily, all the business people in China speak English, so when he's around, they speak English. They would make him an immigrant who doesn't speak the language, dear.\n\nAre you aware that something like 50% of the business in non-English speaking countries in Europe is conducted in English? That's because they're intelligent enough to realize that it's in their best interest to be multilingual. The more languages you speak, the more business you can do with monolinguals, and the more money you make. It's the way of the whole freakin' world. Only citizens of the U.S. seem to think that they should never be forced to speak, or even listen to, another language.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026
1,"is this even possible to solve and if u can how? ; After the parade, the ppl on the float I was on shook hands with eachother. The Mayor came over and shook hands with only the people he knew. How many people did he know if there were 1625 handshakes altogether? ; The answer is that the mayor knew 29 people. And, although you didn't ask it, there were 57 people on the float.\n\nProof:\nGiven a group of n people, if everybody shakes hands once with every other member of the group then there will be (n(n-1))/2 handshakes in total.\n1. If there were 58 people on the float then there would have been ((58*57)/2)=1653 handshakes. But this is more than the total number of handshakes specified in the question so there must have been less than 58 people on the float.\n2. If there were 56 people on the float then there would have been ((56*55)/2)=1540 handshakes. This would mean that the mayor would have had to shake hands with 85 people in order for the total number of handshakes to equal 1625. But if there were only 56 people on the float then it is impossible for the mayor to shake hands 85 times (assuming he only shakes hands once with each person he knows). So there must be more than 56 people on the float.\n2. If there were 57 people on the float then there would have been ((57*56)/2)=1596 handshakes. If the mayor shakes hands with 29 of the 57 people on the float then there would have been 1596+29=1625 handshakes which is what you wanted to know.\n\nBTW: Next time vote for a female mayor - she might have been gracious enough to shake hands with everybody on the float :)",7033

It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water.

The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish.

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

Mr. Tin responded ""It was essential to our strategy""  referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets.

I have the beginning, can you write the best ending? ; As they looked over the landscape, the sun shone through the clouds, glistening through the mist on the mountain's foothills.  \n\nThis place had over a thousand years of history.  Even through the dense jungle they could see the ruins of ancient temples and rock carvings.  Around them, the parrots were squwaking and the tropical flowers were beaded with morning dew.\n\nSomething was beckening them to venture deeper . . . ; it wasn't a voice, it was the sensations felt by millions of pilgrims to the site, drawing them to their God.  As they drew nearer, the sensations of peace deepened and the awe of the place grew tenfold.  Gazing up at the majestic ruins, they sensed the magnitude of the culture and peoples that built it.  As they wandered through the empty streets, they could hear the whispers of street vendors, of the carts being drawn and the animals bawling out their myriad of sounds.  They kept feeling the draw and the presence of something unseen, urging them deeper within the ruins.  \nAs they neared a building that was left virtually unscathed, they noticed the fine craftsmanship on the building and the magnitude of their emotions blossomed.  They approached it with baited breath and entered with reverence.  All around a central altar, benches circled the entire building.  Above the altar was a simple cross and a few words in the ancient tongue, etched in the stone below.  \nAfter struggling with the translations, they discovered the meaning.  It read simply, ""All who seek peace, may find it here"".  All of a sudden, they were filled with a glorious peace, that filled their entire being, and they knew that they had found the ancient God the natives had worshiped, and their own.",7444

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

In your heart you know that you want to be a Freemason.  Because the fraternity does not evangelize in any way we never ask anyone to become a Mason.  Every member has joined of his own freewill and has not been persuaded to become a member.  Your own Grandfather followed this rule and never asked you to join his lodge.\n\nSearch out the most respected members of your community and you will find that they are probably Freemasons.  Tell your desire to one of these men and he will secure for you a petition to the lodge.  A committee of inquiry will call on you at your home to make sure that your desires are true,  that you are a respected member of the community and worthy to become a Mason.   If the committee approves of you; the entire lodge will be notified and you must pass a unanimous ballot.  If any member of the lodge feels that you are unworthy; you will never become a member of the lodge as long as the objection exists.\n\nAs a member you will be part of the world's oldest and greatest fraternity.  You will find charitable needs and causes, education, fellowship, and friendship.  One of the greatest gifts a man can give to another is to help him become a Mason.  I hope that I am responding in such a way that I can give this gift to you.",7599

5,"How much less does golf ball fly in cold temperature?  7 iron 150 yards  in 80 F  vs 50 F? ; and the drive  250 yards  in 80  vs 50 F ? ; I could not find any information about distance.  I cut and paste some info I found.  I sent my Titleist Rep an e-mail asking the same question.  I will send you the info.  \n\nGolf balls travel farther when they are warm.\nSomewhat true. Colder temperatures do decrease a ball's velocity more than warm temperatures; although, the air temperature affects distance much more significantly than the temperature of the ball. The moral of the story is don't bother putting the ball in the oven before teeing off. Your pocket will do just fine. A two-piece ball will have a little faster initial velocity off the clubface in cold weather, so keep that in mind next time the frost is on the ground. \n\nThe weather report also influences which ball to choose. Warm conditions can expand balls, calling for players to use a higher compression. A harder ball helps in high humidity or in low sea level areas, where thick air slows the ball down. \n\nConversely, cold weather tends to harden the ball. Players can counteract the effect by choosing lower compression balls. Softer balls also help in high altitudes where air is thinner and there is less resistance",7666

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",8087

My question is, why on earth would anyone joke about something like that?  Is he just being silly or is there a tiny grain of truth in it? ; I've used that expression with friends before as a joke.

When he arrived he put his head down and ran with his hand covering his face so these poor people who buy his tickets at the theater, who had been waiting to see him for hours, were robbed of the ""privledge"" of seeing him. How hard is it to look around for 20 seconds and wave... I mean really.......\nOn a brighter note, I have to say 2 actors ranked top of my list.\n#1) Dick Van Dyke was the best!!! He and I were chatting one day about doing theater and I swear it was like talking to your favorite uncle. He was funny, attentive, really genuine.\n#2) Ron Howard... This guy is crazy busy but when I asked him if I can take a picture of him and my daughter together, he said ""sure, no problem"" and when the flash didn't go off he said' Oh, your flash didn't go off, try it again""...

5,"What are some good streches? ; I have recently started to exercise a bit more, mainly by jogging/running.  I've noticed that I get shin splints just after a little bit of doing either, and it also hurts my calf muscle too.  Can anyone suggest some good streches for me to do before jogging? ; Well shin splints occur from your main calf muscle dominating all those little muscles around your bone. To help that and to prevent it from happening again, make sure to do a lot of calf raises. These strengthen all your calf muscles and also help warm up the calf muscle. \n\nTo stretch the calf muscle, you can do a couple of different stretches. You can get into a push up position on the ground with one leg, and push the heel back and down onto the ground. Feel the stretch along the back of your calf and knee. Then switch legs. You could also stand up against a rail or fence with posts about a foot or a foot and a half away. Put one foot up against the post with the heel on the ground, and sort of sit into it until you feel the pull on the back of your calf and knee. These should loosen up your calves before you run.\n\nMuscles sometimes tighten up due to deficiencies in diet, too. Try to take in more potassium. Bananas are the healthiest way to get more potassium in your diet without all the other extra sugar and yucky stuff found in orange juice or other 'sources' of potassium. If you eat a banana an hour or two before you run, your muscles won't be as prone to tightening up.\n\nHave fun exercising! Running is awesome!",8318

1,"Next Solar System moon to be discovered after Galileo found Io, Ganymede, Europa & Callisto? When? By whom? ; Was it another moon of Jupiter? Or one orbiting another planet in the Solar System? Was it soon afterwards? Or did the Church's condemnation of Galileo's findings inhibit more research from taking place for a long time? ; Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, and after Ganymede, the second-largest moon in the Solar System. Discovered by Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer on March 25th, 1655 about 45 years later than Galielo's discovery of 7th January 1610.\n\nTwo generations later suggests to me that the church did inhibit research. Telescopes existed, and the thought that if Jupiter had moons, then Saturn might have them, too, must have occurred to the astronomers of the day, Perhaps it inhibited publication more than research? Another factor to consider is that Holland was also less under the sway of Roman Catholicism than Italy had been for Galileo.\n\nHuygens named his discovery simply Saturni Luna (Latin for ""Saturn's moon"", which can also be written Luna Saturni) (De Saturni Luna observatio nova, 1656; XV). Later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus) Lodoicea Sidera (""the stars of Louis"") to honour king Louis XIV.\n\nThe name ""Titan"" and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, wherein he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used.\n\nJupiter was the Roman equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and Saturn the Roman equivalent of Zeus' father, Cronos (Zeus' mother was Rhea, the name given to another of Saturn's moons).\n\nThe Huygens spacecraft and Cassini probe that explored Titan in 2004 were named after these two astronomers.",8345

2,"summer weight loss!!!!? ; I am an 11th grader and I weight about 232lbs. we tke senior pics during the summer(july) before 12th grade year. is it possible to lose 100lbs before then? if so can you please tell me how  Thanks ; You can lose a lot of weight between now and the summer if you work at it a little.   If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393

Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.

Why do some people have a problem with others beliefs, and are so quick to come on and insult? (In a religion site if I may add.) What the fight rooms filled? MTV off the air today? Mall closed? Satanic worship hall shut down? So what we have a problem with religion, and God and Jesus, and the Jehovahs Witness' and Allah, and Wiccan, and Pagan, and Kirshna(sorry if I left out any) so we come to THERE site and INSULT them. Now that is priceless. Leave everyone to there own religion, just ask your questions, and let peace be with everyone. No matter who there God is, most here have genuine questions. ; It is true that Jehovah's Witnesses are not loved by everyone.\nhttp://jw-media.org/newsroom/human_rights.htm\nSome people hate Jehovah's Witnesses out of ignorance, or over some misunderstanding. A few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a Jehovah's Witness, and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire Christian religion.\n\nHowever, it seems that the majority of anti-Witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry. A few may even be motivated against their Christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things', Satan the Devil.\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:4) the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\n\nInterestingly, such ""hatred"" should be expected by true Christians in this time of the end, and it actually helps identify Jehovah's Witnesses as Christ's true disciples:\n\n(John 15:19) If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20030301/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20020401/article_01.htm",9396

1,How agent of biological warfare can becreated using geneticengeenering? how can it beintroduced int population ; this is for my microbiology class and not with the bioterrorism ; you could make antibiotic/antiviral resistant strains of viruses or bacterea. change the genetics of plants to create more of a certain toxin so you can get a greater yield of toxin per plant.

1,"if humans and chimpanzees mated, would they have children? ; i know it is unethical, bestial, and an abomination of all creation. but i'm just asking for curiousity's sake and nothing more.\n\ni heard that a mule is the offspring of a donkey and a horse. i was wondering if humans and apes could have offsprings too. ; Humans and chimpanzees are not in the same genus, and our genetic makeup is fairly far removed.  However, we may never know unless we try, and there are many ethical barries that would prevent that.  Humans and chimpanzees ARE apes, and closely related ones at that.  I wouldn't rule it out as a possiblity.  Asian and African elephants are in completely genera, and they can produce hybrid offspring.\n\nChimp/human hybrids, despite their questionable existence, even have a name.  They are called chumans or humanzees.  The chimp Oliver was claimed to be a manpanzees, but was most likely a chimp with genetic mutations whose affection toward women and human-like behavior was due to being raised by humans. \n\nHere's a link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manpanzee",9781

We spent a total of about 1 1/2 hours on each date. The answer I got was that she couldn't find a sitter. She has a 12yr old son, and a 6yr old daughter. I even suggested that we could do pizza and a movie at her house just so we could spend more time together. She never really gave me a good answer on that. And I know, she may not have wanted to get the kids involved so early. I understand that, even though I had met the kids. ; It's pretty obvious that she's no longer interested  in you.Just try to understand her because it's hard to be mom,maybe she's having a problem with her kids and she doesn't want you to get involve,try to get out her into your mind,go and find someone that you deserve.GOOD LUCK",9784

Whales (mostly sperm whales) were hunted for their oil which could be used for light, make up, and other things. Once petrolium (crude oil) was discovered, whaling was no longer necessary. Whaling was then banned because of its effects on the environment. Fish populations were affected, but we also liked to catch those.

4,"amazon.com and amazon marketplace is the same thing? ; if not, whats the difference? ; Amazon Marketplace is is where sellers other than Amazon can sell their used or new items. When you are looking at an item, look to see who it is available from. It can say one or both of the following: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and/or available from these sellers. In my experience as an employee, I have seen items ship all over the world. If it says ships from and sold by Amazon then it should ship anywhere in the world. If you select an item from a different seller, there is a chance that they will not ship overseas. The great thing about Amazon is that they will post a link to sellers of an item even if they sell it cheaper than Amazon does. That way, you have a choice as to where to go to purchase an item.\n\nOf course, if you are still unsure about shipping to your country, you can always email customer service. The website also lists links to several of their international sites.\n\nThe first link I've listed should take you to a a portion of Amazon's site that lists deadlines for international orders. The second will take you to an Amazon.com help page that will have helpful information on it. Both will have a button on it that you can click on to contact customer service.\n\nHope this helps!",9925
