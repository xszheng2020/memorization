I was highschool class president once, I would try to appeal to as diverse a group as possible.  Your posters need to grab attention, to make up for lack of creativity, get as many posters, stickers, or whatever out there and get the most exposure.  People are going to vote for their friends in highschool, and I found that most of the academians that were running only had a small group of friends that were all as lame as they were.

5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13
9,"Did you really get a tax cut under Bu$h? ; Some do not understand even simple math. I pay $2200 per year in School taxes on my property, in simple math is this a Tax cut? It increased 5 times in 4 years under Bu$h.\n\nWASHINGTON - If it seems like your taxes have been going up, they probably have — at least at the state level. State taxpayer burdens increased by an average of 41 percent from 1994 to 2004, according to newly released data from the census bureau. Only one state, Alaska, saw the amount it collects per person decline. Even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation, the individual tax burdens increase in 43 states.\nHawaiians last year paid the most to state government — $3,050 per person on average. Texans paid the least — an average of $1,368.\nRising education and Medicaid costs have fueled spending growth, which has led to higher taxes, analysts said.\n""Medicaid has been the fastest growing program in state budgets going back to 2000,"" said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst at the National Council of State Legislatures.\nMedicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. In an effort to stem rising costs, Congress passed legislation last week allowing states to charge about 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries new or increased co-payments and premiums. ; Only if you are a major corporation and/or a really rich person that does not need a tax cut.  I'm too poor to get a tax cut. Billioaires for Bush",16

0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25

2,"i can't sleep at night i don't drink caffine though.? ; I'm 12 and i want my sleep! i want to grow :) but i CAN'T SLEEP. i feel uncomfortable and my heart rate goes fast and i breathe hard it bothers me so much. whats wrong with me? does fast metabolism cause this? ; Your metabolism determines how much energy you expend while at rest; it does not determine how well you sleep.\n\nI'll give you some pointers on getting a better night's sleep. If these ""sleep hygiene"" tips don't work, you may wish to consult a doctor.\n\n1. Avoid caffeine. It sounds like you're already doing this, so good for you! (I'm posting this advice anyway in case others are having similar problems.) Also avoid smoking (as nicotine is a stimulant) and drinking alcohol (which interferes with natural sleep) before bedtime.\n\n2. Try to go to bed and get up the same time each day, even if you don't have to (e.g., on weekends). This will help your body establish a stable sleep schedule.\n\n3. Turn the lights down about an hour before your bedtime. Light sends signals to your brain that it should be awake, and this is not the message you want to send if you want some sleep!\n\n4. Exercise regularly! But avoid exercising a few hours before your bedtime.\n\n5. Take a warm bath or shower before bed. This will help relax you.\n\n6. Drink milk shortly before bedtime, or eat some turkey. Both of these foods contain substances that help promote sleep. Some people have reported success with taking melatonin.\n\n7. Do not use your bed to watch TV, play video games, read, or do your homework. You want your brain to associate being in bed with going to sleep, not other activities.\n\n8. If you find you cannot sleep, don't stay in bed and get anxious about how much sleep you're missing. Instead, get up, and find some relaxing activity you can do (e.g., reading) under dim light until you begin to feel drowsy again.\n\n9. Be careful about taking sleep-inducing medications, as these can be habit-forming and also interfere with the REM (dream) phase of sleep, which is the most refreshing part of sleep.\n\nGood luck!",27
7,"Why does everyone who makes a ""how much do you know about Naruto"" quiz on quizilla, think they know all about ; it?   This is a question my son wants answered:D ; This happens because there are Naruto fans that they know almost everything there is to the animation series, but in reality, the actual Japanese companies: Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo, Aniplex, and TV Tokyo Music, who have created the series really know everything about the series.\n\nThere are lots of Naruto fans out there and some even live on the shows when they are released. When an individual makes a quiz, they just want to compare their knowledge with other people who are also fans to Naruto. \n\nThere can even be times when the person making the quiz is wrong on some facts. However, they just guess and make questions out of them. It is only their opinion of who is right or wrong. Unless a person has analyzed every aspect and every episode of the Naruto series, a person will not be able to know everything about it. \n\nThose who make the quizzes probably do know a lot about the anime series, but I doubt they know everything. The basic truths of the human mind can only go so far.\n\nQuizilla is a place that people make quizzes to test others' abilities or are bored and have enjoyment while creating their own quiz. I don't recommend the site if you want to learn more things that others have already learned. \n\nAll and all, confidence is the key idea that we should be looking at in the person making the quiz. There is no other solution.",28

I have tried cutting back on calories but I have no will power as my appetite is out of control and I am constantly hungry and eating twice as much as I used to. I tried walking on the treadmill for 20 minutes but it made me sore and gave me horrible joint pain.

9,"Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? ; Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? \n\n\nBy Derek Shaw \nThe Daily Trojan\nOctober 4, 2002 \nGeorge Orwell's ""1984"" depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. The threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the ""Party,"" the single political power in the totalitarian state of Oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people.\n\nSound somewhat familiar? Well it should ...\n\nAs the likelihood of war in the Middle East continues to escalate, American citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing Americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. \n\nWithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in ""1984"" to the affairs of today.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nIn ""1984,"" the bold slogan of the Party is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" This set of socio-political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. The assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption.\n\nThe state of Oceania in ""1984"" is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever-shifting enemy. The government leads the public to \n\nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact \n\nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. One day the enemy is Eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is Eastasia and has always been Eastasia. The people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. The real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred.\n\nToday we are facing imminent war with Iraq. A year ago our target was al-Qaida and bin Laden. Then it became a battle within Afghanistan. And just to be sure, President George W. Bush openly labeled Iran, North Korea and Iraq as the ""axis of evil."" In a later speech, he added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIndeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. On Aug. 22, 2002, Bush called Saddam Hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. Granted, Hussein is not the first person on most of our Christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? Surely it is a mere coincidence that Bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting Iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world.\n\nIn many ways, Bush has become the physical manifestation of Big Brother, the omnipotent, all-knowing symbol of leadership in Oceania. In ""1984,"" Big Brother is both feared and loved by the people. His power goes untested. Similarly, the Bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the American people have responded with a show of faith and support. In fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show American pride with stickers, T-shirts and flags. A frenzy of nationalism has infected our country; and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the United States.\n\nAs a result, American freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. In ""1984,"" signs re ; With massive data bases of information piling up in government and corporate computers as well as security cameras around every corner and on every cell phone, I often get the feeling Big Brother is watching.  However, I feel Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is better example of the direction we have been moving as a society.  Everywhere people are seeking their own ""Soma"" to cover up our social flaws.  We are also pushing closer and closer to his predictions of class and family structures .",40

1,"when zinc rod is immeersed in blue colour copper sulphate. blue colour fades away. give reasons.? ; chemistry ; all the information you need is in the handy periodic table.   First, think about the charges of the molecules....\n\n In the molecule CuSO4, copper has two electrons to give.  The SO4 molecule wants TWO more electrons to acheive noble gas configuration (a stable electron state).   This appears to be a match in heaven.  \n\nWell all is fine until Zinc comes along.  If you look at the periodic table, Zinc is just to the right of copper.  It too has 2 electrons to donate......but, it is more electronegative than copper. (remember, electronegativity  is the lowest in the bottom left corner of the table(Fr) and increases on  a diagonal path  with F being the most electronegarive.)  \n\nSince Zinc is more reactive than Copper,  a replacement reaction occurs.  Zinc bumps Copper off of the SO4 molucule.  Zinc can be whitiish to yellowish in solution.  As all the Zinc is coming off the rod, it bumps the copper off the SO4 and also disperses the colour of the copper.  If you had one drop of blue dye (the copper), but added a cup of milk.

So, Kate it is.\n\nHolmes' 'Passive' Behavior Stuns Interviewer\n7 April 2006 (WENN)\nPregnant actress Katie Holmes stunned a magazine journalist when she accompanied fiance Tom Cruise on a recent interview, by acting in a ""dazed, passive and vacant"" manner. The former Dawson's Creek beauty, 27, sat quietly beside Cruise as he opened up about his abusive father Thomas Mapother III to Parade reporter Dotson Rader.

0,"Is there any way I can quit acting like Judas all of the time?(please read on)? ; Every time I get ""saved"" something-someone hurts me, i always blame it on God. I feel like Judas, now I see no point in turning to God if I am going to betray him once again. Any ideas for me? ; If something hurts you it is just god testing your faith. He puts us through trials and tribulations to test our faith in him. No matter what happens we should always stick with him through thick and thin. If you continue turning on God nothing will ever seem right.\n\nIt is comforting to know that with God, all trials and tribulations have a divine purpose. We are never alone. He told His disciples that they would be scattered, leaving Him alone, and yet ""I am not alone, because the Father is with me. ""These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. ""In the world you have tribulation, but take courage, I have overcome the world."" (John 16:32, 33)\n\n \n\n""...I will never leave you, nor forsake you; therefore I can boldly say, 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear what man can do to me"" (Hebrews 13:5b,6). Trials develop godly character. ""...we exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance; and perseverance, proven character, and proven character, hope; and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us...\n\n \n\nJesus Christ set the perfect example. ""But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."" (Romans 5:3-5) These verses point out aspects of His divine purpose for both Jesus Christ's trials and tribulations, and ours. Persevering proves our faith. ""I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me"" (Philippians 4:13).\n\n \n\n""In this you greatly rejoice, even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials, that the proof of your faith, being more precious than gold which perishes, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ."" The true believer should accept trials and tribulations because ""You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for Gods own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light"" (1 Peter 1:6, 7, 2:9). ""If you are reviled for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.....""if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not feel ashamed, but in that name let him glorify God"" (1 Peter 4:14, 16).\n\n \n\nAt the same time, we must be careful never to make excuses for our ""trials and tribulations"" if they are a result of our own wrong doing. ""By no means let any of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or a troublesome meddler"" (1 Peter 4:15).\n\n \n\nTrials and tribulations come with both a purpose and a reward. ""Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing."" ""Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those who love Him"" (James 1:2-4,12).\n\n \n\nWe have the victory. ""But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord, Jesus Christ."" I hope that these verses will encourage you to see that although we are in a spiritual battle, Satan has no authority over the believer in Christ, unless he/she chooses to yield to him. God has given us His Word to guide us, His Holy Spirit to enable us, and the privilege of coming to Him anywhere, at any time, to pray about anything! Go for it!",58

9,"who was Kim 2 Sung and what was he known for? ; what contributions did he make to Asia? ; Kim Il-sung (15 April 1912 – 8 July 1994) was the leader of North Korea from its founding in 1948 until his death, when he was succeeded by his son Kim Jong-il. He held the posts of Prime Minister from 1948 to 1972 and President from 1972 to his death, although his real power came from his position as General Secretary of the Korean Workers' Party. North Korea officially refers to him as the ""Great Leader"" and he is designated in the constitution as the country's ""eternal President."" His birthday and the day of his death are public holidays in North Korea.\nRestored as leader of North Korea, Kim purged his political rivals, particularly the former southern Korean Communist leadership, and embarked on the reconstruction of the country devastated by the war. He launched a five-year national economic plan to establish a Soviet-style command economy, with all industry owned by the state and all agriculture collectivised. The economy was based on heavy industry, particularly arms production. North Korea retained huge armed forces to defend the 1953 ceasefire line.\n\nDuring the 1950s, Kim was seen as an orthodox Communist leader, loyal to and ultimately under the control of the Soviet Union. When the Sino-Soviet split developed in the 1960s, however, Kim became increasingly independent. He sided with the Chinese in the early 1960s, but never severed his relations with the Soviets. When the Cultural Revolution broke out in China after 1966, Kim veered back to the Soviet side. At the same time, he established an extensive personality cult in which he was called the ""Great Leader""\n\nKim developed the policy and ideology of Juche (self-reliance), and North Korea became increasingly independent from the rest of the world.\n\nA new constitution was proclaimed in December 1972, under which Kim became President of North Korea. By this time, he had decided that his son Kim Jong-il would succeed him, and increasingly delegated the running of the government to him. The Kim family was supported by the army, due to Kim Il-Sung's revolutionary record and the support of the veteran defence minister, Oh Jin-wu. At the Sixth Party Congress in October 1980, Kim publicly designated his son as his successor.\n\nHope this helps!",61

9,"what is the root of the fight between Israel and Palestine? ; I watch the movie Munich directed by Steven Spielberg.Based on the true events. 11 Israeli athletes were held hostage and killed by terrorists during the 1972 olympics. ; Dear derekmleiniger,\n\nYour analogy is totally wrong. Unlike English and other establishers of USA, Israelis started to kill the Palestinians grabbing their land and not ready to give any rights to them. The only reason that Palestinians are facing hard time is that they don't have any port and can't do business activities independently. \n\nWhile only reason Israelis look flourishing is the aid sent by the oversees Jews as well as hefty amount of $ 3 billion from US only.\n\nFollowing is an account of Israel's leaders, you can find it very different compares to people who came to US:\n\n\n\n""We must use terror, assassination, intimidation, land confiscation, and the cutting of all social services to rid the Galilee of its Arab population.""\n-- David Ben-Gurion, May 1948, to the General Staff.

You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you because geography books no longer exist. Not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahlal arose in the place of Mahlul; Kibbutz Gvat in the place of Jibta; Kibbutz Sarid in the place of Huneifis; and Kefar Yehushua in the place of Tal al-Shuman.

7,"Any one see the film Network directed by Sidney Lumet?  Can you tell me what it was about? ; How does the media mis handle world news?\nWhat is teh filmmakers view on modern day American society? ; I have seen and love the movie Network.  If I'm not mistaken, it was a Best Picture winner, and deservedly so.  Lumet is a brilliant director.\n\nIt was a critique on news media that tried to demonstrate how ratings rule all in television, even news media.  Basically it takes a comical spin on one unbalanced man's realization that sensationalism is more important that REAL news to most news media outlets.  He unintentionally finds a unique way to get everybody's attention and boost his own ratings the day that he finds out that he will be fired the next day.  He takes this newfound publicity and tries to expose to the news media to his viewers as a monster that he helped create.  People begin to rally around his charged speeches. His televised speeches about the evils of news media piss off his bosses at the station, but they keep putting him on the air because he gets such great ratings.  Until one day, their patience limit is reached and they...\n\nI won't spoil the rest.  Go rent it, kid.  It'll be good for you and you'll like it.",68

It was warm for a while, like back in March, and now it is cold again (like 60's and 70s). it is June it should be much warmer than this for this time of year. \nWill it ever get warm again?? Why is the weather like this? I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.  Give it a couple of days, and it'll get warmer.\n\nQuite frankly, though, I prefer weather in the 60s and 70s.  It's just about perfect.",78

Ask questions to get to know the person better, talk about any interests you have, classes, guys/girls, parents, etc. Becoming genuinely interested in the other person.\n\nA somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn't like. Generally the other person will complain too and you'll have you're conversation. You have to be Very careful not to do this often because you don't want the other person to think you're a whiner.\n\nPay Attention to what the other person says! This one is Extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered.\n\nContinue to speak to everyone you know regularly. If you are walking and see someone you haven’t talked to in a while, stop for a moment and talk to them. It does not have to be a long conversation, just say hello, see how they are doing and if anything is wrong. You would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them.\n\nBe nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note. You don't have to make sure the other person has a great time Every Single conversation, but you don't want to think of all the petty arguements they've had with you.\n\nArguements... Don't. There are VERY few 'good' arguements. ""The only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it.""\nIf you're wrong, admit it.\n\nDO NOT critize the person, or a friend, when talking to the person. If you want to point out something they did wrong, try to point out something similar you did wrong.\n\nSmile! Not a forced smile, the person you're talking to will be able to tell the difference. And you don't have to be an overly happy hyper-active person. Just smile naturally and, if you can, be somewhat happy. Remembering good times with your friends/family can help.\n\nLet the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener. (Somewhat stated in my first advice, ask questions, talk about interests the other person has. Answer questions sincerly.)\n\nHonestly make the person you're talking to feel important. You don't want to fake this one or do it too often, but if you honestly think they did something well, give them that praise.\n\nIf you want more advice, there are a couple good books that Will actually help. How to Win Friends and Influence People, is probably one of the best ones. It's an old book, but trust me, it's just as useful today as it was when it was written.",93

1,"If magnetic field of earth is changing continuosly would that effect bird migration patterns?? ; if polarity of earth is changed upside down, would that effect the birds?? ; That is a good question. Some birds and some insects use the magnetic field of the earth to give them clues for navigation, along with landmarks, and polarization of light etc. My guess is that at first they might be a little confused, but they use multiple clues, so they would soon adjust and learn the new pattern. \n\nAfter all, it flips fairly often on earth's time scale.  Apparently on average it flips every 300,000 years, and  the last flip was 780,000 years ago, so we are a bit overdue at the moment. Obviously, the birds have survived through lots of flips, and movements of the earth and landmarks etc. So they will probably survive the next flip too, but not necessarily without some confusion.",107

0,"Your religion and population? ; I always wandered what drives people that live poor, in lack of health, food, infrastructure,..., to have many children. I know sometimes it is religion, but I would like to dig deeper here. I know it is also poverty, lack of knowledge, lack of education on contraception, so I am focusing on religion and its role. An example (due to the sensitivity of the issue, I will not state the country): religious people do not work here, do not pay taxes, and live really in modesty, many times in hunger. But their religion tells them to have many children, therefore many of religious families have more than 8 children - who live poor, in lack of food, lack of proper education,... I do not understand this. I myself love children, would love to have 4, but do not have job, I am 28, therefore I do not want to have my first child yet. Even if my religion is telling me 'children are a gift from God', I am sorry, but to me it is not responsible to have them yet or to have many. ????? ; I agree with you, I often wonder, in Africa for example where christianity is rising, why the pope still claims contraception is wrong when encouraging it would help stabilize the countries HIV/Aids epidemic and could also help the countries economy in the long run - having less children means the children they have are better fed, they can afford some sort of education as they have a couple of children to send to school. These children once educated could get better jobs and the cycle carries on. \nIf I was living in poverty I wouldn't have so many children as it is selfish - having them just because you want so many and your religion tells you to do so. They can not provide for them and it is cruel to the children who suffer starvation and a slow painful death in the name of religion.",131

The J.D. is technically a first-professional rather than a research doctorate, and holders of the degree in the United States do not, by custom, take the title ""Dr."" in formal address or common speech (see below for historical explanation).\n\nIn all 50 states of the United States, graduation from a law school accredited by the American Bar Association satisfies the academic requirements to take the bar examination. While the law school accreditation requirements of the ABA require students to have three years of undergraduate work before being admitted, the majority of American law schools now are members of the Association of American Law Schools, which requires that law school applicants hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university prior to graduation from law school.

1,"Is this possible to know about future by Einstein's Time Traveler / The twin paradox theory? ; I am very curious about this topic, or tell me if any other possibilities to know about future atleast theoretically. ; In fact we indeed are traveling in time. But, only in one direction, i.e., towards the future; and that too, with a certain fixed 'speed' (call it, spending one second per second). Do you understand what I am saying? I am saying that we can not move backward towards our past, and , we have no control over the passage of time.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, however suggests a theoretical method to control the passage of time: Time dilation, which requires moving with speeds around the speed of light. The theory holds that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. However, this effect allows ""time travel"" only toward the future: never backward. \n\nMany in the scientific community believe that time travel is highly unlikely. This belief is largely due to Occam's Razor. Any theory which would allow time travel would require that issues of causality be resolved. What happens if you try to go back in time and kill your grandfather. Also, in the absence of any experimental evidence that time travel exists, it is theoretically simpler to assume that it does not happen. Indeed, Stephen Hawking once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel - a variant of the Fermi paradox, with time travelers instead of alien visitors. However, assuming that time travel cannot happen is also interesting to physicists because it opens up the question of why and what physical laws exist to prevent time travel from occurring. \n\nFrom the above note, one can note two points:\n1. Time-travel is highly unlikely, and,\n2. Possibly, it is uni-directional (towards the future, not back to past).\n\nSo, it seems that knowing the future by visiting it is either not possible, or, once you are in your future, you can't come back to present to tell your friends that you know the future!!!\n\nPartly, knowing the future theoretically, is perhaps possible if you understand and meticulously use the principle of causality.",254

Protectionist policies are those that advantage domestic goods over foreign goods (exports v imports) through either tarriffs (surcharges added to the price of a good being imported) or through subsidies (price supports or distributive policies within a country) to grow or make some item.\nObviously, similiar to the micro level of a larger grocery store being able to get better prices when negotiating with its suppliers compared to a smaller chain or a 'mom & pop' type store, larger countries (typically first world) are better positioned to DICTATE supply agreements (not much can be done about demand---other than to decrease it through tarriffs (VAT) which would be passed on to the consumer).  \nThird and second world countries are often in a very tenuous position:  their government wants to expand their economy through increasing exports, however, often this is done through either internally, creating subsidies (which many cannot afford to do) or agreeing to 'lopsided' trade agreements, which wind up exploiting or at a minimum, disadvantaging their citizens and other workers in their respective countries or nations.  Additionally, there are contravening issues like human rights and environmental standards which may also be of concern.\nI hope this helps, but here are some articles for you to read and consider; as well as the WTO link",341

Many thanks!! ; Sounds liek your doctor is a quack. A relaxation CD? Well TMD is a complex disease that people don't really understand all that well but there are steps to treatment. First step is that if you grind or clench at night or in the daytime is to correct that problem. Stressing a bad joint is only going to make the problem worse. So you should stop clenching or grinding during the daytime. At night there is an appliance that is made so that it basically stops you from clenching so hard. It's like a mouthguard with a flat bottom. You can also take muscle relaxants to help with the clenching at night.

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

2,"I Have Been Told That I Have A Heart Murmur,But It Doesn't Sound Like What Is Decribed As A Normal Murmur? ; My new doctor discovered a heart mumur about a month ago.She said it was nothing .An innocent murmur,but my understanding of a murmur is a sound that happens between the lub dub .My mumur is an extra sound that is heard every fifth beat, like a lub dub  a dub ,I am confused about the sequence and wondering  if there is more that perhaps she didn't hear  when I was there in her office.She diagnosed me as PTSD and said that the stress could be causing the mumur but lately if I get up too early and don't get enough rest I get a headache and feel like its hard for me to breathe.I also recently visitied a ent which  couldnt find any type of artery blockage or ear problems but also said he heard turbulent blood flow. I can't really get a straight answer  about  what either doctor heard ,but neither seem to think that I had a problem.I was just wondering  if the sound that im hearing every fifth beat is what they are referring to? Please only if you are medical or have direct knowledge of it? ; First off, a murmur is simply turbulent blood flow and sounds like a 'whoosh'. The lub and the dub are valves closing, first the atrio-ventricular valves and then the aortic and pulmonary.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are two kinds of murmur; systolic and diastolic. A systolic murmur, when the ventricles are contracting, is a murmur between the lub and the dub, and can be aortic or pulmonary stenosis or mitral or bicuspid regurgitation. A diastolic murmur is one between the dub and the lub and can be aortic or pulmonary regurgitation or mitral or bicuspid stenosis. There can also be murmurs that occur throughout the cardiac cycle.\n\nBased on what you have described, it doesn't sound as if you have a murmur, an occasional third heart sound is suggestive of a number of other things. A diagnosis can only be made with the benefit of an ECG and maybe an echocardiogram.\n\nGood luck, hope this helps.\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nTo answer the follow up, I don't know, that's really beyond my knowledge. Some murmurs are harmless and are actually best left untreated. If two doctors are happy with you, I wouldn't worry too much about what someone like me says here. However, personally, I would want to be followed up by a cardiologist.",401

I have taken tricyclics, SSRIs and what they refer to as atypicals (like Effexor).  I know hundreds of people who take them through my work and they are fine.  The antidepressants allow them to function more comfortably while hopefully they work on other ways of dealing with life and the causes of the depression or other disorder.\n\nBut...as to what we know long term...I asked my doctor the same thing and he said, and I agree, we do not know.  The trycyclics have been around a while, but they are not given much anymore.  The SSRI's have not been around a ""life span"" so in essense we are still finding out about them.  \n\nWe do know that for some people, they reach a point where they stop working and they much either up the dose, change to a different medicine or add a medicine to what they are taking now.\n\nSome people are NOT able to take them, that we do know. And, we do know that the reaction to them is very individualized...one person may do great, the next person may not get any relief at all. Going off them should be done with your doctor and any of them should be tapered off very, very slowly to prevent relapse.\n\nIn time I think there will be better medicines for us and we will also know more about those we take now.

Anyone knowing the basics of INS navigation could have easily flown those planes to New York, Washington DC, Katmandu or anywhere else.\n\nHowever, there is a simpler explanation in this case.  Both of the planes that hit the WTC towers were hijacked over eastern Massachusetts.  The hijackers then simply flew down the Hudson River to Manhattan.\n\nIn the case of the other two aircraft, there isn't an easy answer, (since there isn't a river to follow directly) but both of them apparantly got lost enroute.\n\nBTW: This is an excellent example of how the two New York attacks were carried out completely differently from the Washington DC attacks.",414

When I was there, they said I had another 4 cavities needing filled, but they couldn't do it because they only treated emergency cases. \n\nI'm a student at the minute, but start working in August and until then, can't afford to get the work done privately. Do you think it's OK to just leave these cavities until, say, September when I'll have some money? Of the four cavities, only one is causing me any problems at the minute, and it's not too bad, just occasional pain with sweet things. The others give me no problems at all. ; I'm a registered dental hygienist and there is no way to tell  how long a person can hold out w/ getting a filling. I would say if you don't see holes in your teeth when you look in the mirror, you can probally wait til september as long as u are brushing twice a day, everyday, and stay away from cigarettes and Mountain Dew. If u see holes in your teeth, I would get it done ASAP, before u wake up w/ a tooth ache on a Sunday morning or a Holiday when noone is at the office. FYI- If u ever get a toothache DO NOT LAY DOWN. Your blood will rush to your head and cause the tooth to ache even more!!! Good Luck",432

I teach 8th graders and I can't believe that I see in them the same attitudes you are speaking of.  They are getting this 'spoon feed me attitude' from their parents.

1,"why have the mental illnesses not been removed during evolution through natural selection like other genes? ; Schizophrenia is a common disease found in all human cultural societies. This may be explained by the evolution. There seems to be a connection between the genes behind mental illness, and creativity. Many famous artists have for instance been schizophrenic. ""Without their genes man might still live in caves."" (Statement made by the Icelandic scientist Jon Karlsson about mentally ill persons and their relatives.) Mental diseases are documented far back in history and occur in all human cultures. Schizophrenia is the result of a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. But why have the mental illnesses not been removed during evolution through natural selection, the way unfavorable genes usually are? ; Let's name three genes A/a, B/b, C/c. Capitals indicate the dominant one. Let's say you need a aa bb cc combination to be schizophrenic. \n\nPeople who have any of the recessives is smarter than average. Those with two recessives are geniuses. Those with three, crazy. Let's say the recessive is 1/10th as common as the dominant.\n\nThen we have ratios: ABC = 72.9%, aBC/AbC/ABc = 24.3%, abC/aBc/Abc = 2.7%, abc = 0.1%.\n\nWhich means we have one out of four people be ""above average"" in intelligence, 1 out of 40 to be genius or near-genius, and one out of a thousand to be schizophrenic.\n\nThe biological pay-off of the genes reaches an equilibrium at the point where the benefits to the species (above average, geniuses) outweigh the harm (schizophrenics); in other words, when the benefits are maximized.\n\nWere these recessive genes to disappear, not only would the schizophrenics go away, but also the geniuses. Were these genes to be even less common, the ratio of geniuses would be to low to produce any real benefit to the species.",447

The word ""Brain"" refers directly to the Cerebral cortex found in higher animals.  Ants are surprisingly intelligent nevertheless.  Ants, like other insects have networks of nerve cells called Ganglia.  Each ganglion is in charge of simpler tasks that help the simple organism cope with challenges presented by its habitat.  On the other hand, a Human cerebral cortex with ten billion cell bodies is by far the most ingenious cellular network in the universe capable of processing vast amounts of information.

4,"how do i resolve undetermined externals in C++ ?? ; I am working on a project right now.. and i am getting 1 unresolved external error.. what can i do to fix this? ; There are a few typical reasons for unresolved\nexternals in C++.  \n\nThe simplist cause is that you forgot to link in a\nrequired library.  I'm not proficient with Windows,\nbut on a Unix/Linux/Solaris machine, you can search\nthrough libraries using ""nm"" to find the missing\nsymbol (and then specify that library on your linker\ninvocation).\n\nMaybe the next simplist cause would be that you\nactually are missing a symbol (ie. because of an\n#ifdef or some oversight in your Makefile, some\nsource file didn't compile).  Look for the symbol\nin the source and make sure that file is correctly\ncompiled.  [By the way, it is quite possible that\nyour linker will report ""mangled"" names which\nincorporate the class hierarchy of the type of\nthe symbol.  You may wish to filter your linker\noutput through something to reconstitute the\noriginal symbol name.  On many systems, this filter\nis called ""c++filt"", but I've also seen it called\n""dem"" (as in demangler).]\n\nFinally, in C++, I've seen another cause of unresolved\nsymbols being short-comings in the template instantiation\nsystem.  In the general case, the compilation system\nshould detect the use of templates and create the\nnecessary versions where and when needed, but some\ncompilers provide more limited support.  In those cases,\nit may be necessary to explicitly instantiate the \nmissing template.  Take a good look at the unresolved\nsymbol (particularly if you can ""demangle"" the name)\nto see if it looks like it should be provided by one\nof your (or the system's) templates.  That would be\nthe clue that this is an instantiation problem.",592

5,"Whats been the most exciting match of the 2006 Fifa World cup? ; What match do u think has been the most exciting so far in the world cup? ; GER-CRC, TUN-SDA, GER-POL, GHA-CZE, ARG-MEX, POR-NED, and GER-ARG were pretty exciting, as far as this tournament goes.  In terms of lots of chances, GER-POL and GHA-CZE are probably the best; in those games, Germany and Ghana really pressed forward and had exciting moments in front of goal, while Poland and the Czech Republic were able to get good counter-attacks against them, which was fun to watch.  GER-CRC had lots of goals, and was closer than the final score suggests.  TUN-SDA was just had a great second half, with a very late equalizer.  POR-NED was pretty exciting in part because it was a close game, but mainly because the referee made a spectacle of himself.  ARG-MEX and ARG-GER were exciting because they were close games that went to extra time and a shoot-out, respectively, but the quality of play wasnt the best as in some of the games.  I think the GER-POL has been the best so far.",603
4,"What is AJAX? And how does it work? ; Please describe. I have only a vague idea ; Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and\nXML. It is a method by which user’s interaction with  any application happens independentaly of communication with the server. Ajax engine consisting of javascripts gets downloaded on to the browser when a user opens a web page and act as an go between the the server and the user's browser. Every user action that normally would generate an HTTP request takes the form of a JavaScript call to the Ajax engine instead. Any response to a user action that doesn’t require a trip back to the server — such as simple data validation, editing data in memory, and even some navigation — the engine handles on its own. If the engine needs something from the server in order to respond — if it’s submitting data for processing, loading additional interface code, or retrieving new data — the engine makes those requests asynchronously, usually using XML, without stalling a user’s interaction with the application.\n\najax is being used by google for its various services like Gmail,Google Suggest. You must have noticed in Gmail that when you type in the address box you get the address list as suggestions as soon as you type. This is through Ajax",604

5,"What must Raja Bell do to be considered as the next Michael Jordan? ; If you were his agent an you want to make  more money out of him.. ; Firstly he'd need to be a fulltime starter, secondly he'd have to do more offensively & defensively(if you remember jordan was an  all star defender as well) but mostly offensively. he should be able to hit the big shot when its needed most, but mostly he needs to be on another team. Being surrounded by as much talent as he is hurts his money making ability as hes looked upon as ""just"" another cog in the Phoenix Suns machine , whereas Jordan was the ""main "" cog in the Chicago Bulls machine. Do you think the Bulls come even close if Pippen leads that team without Jordan? Ok now compare that to Phoenix where you have Steve Nash, Amare Stoudamire, Shawn Marion and even Boris Diaw. Don't get me wrong Phoenix would certainly miss Raja Bell if he left, but they'd still be considered a ""contending"" team  whereas Chicago without Jordan , in my mind at least ,wouldn't even be close to being a contender",608

9,"TRIVIA QUESTION>>>>> Which war can lay claim to be the REAL first 'world war'? ; I have a specific war in mind but other wars will be considered if you have a good reason for nominating it... ; These are all very thoughtful answers, and they should be appreciated, but unfortunately most of them don't really encompass the idea of a world war but a known-world war (I am splitting hairs, and I am being a jerk, but please hear me out before you send your dogs to bite me).\n\nThe first actual world war would be the War of the Spanish Succession (approx 1739, also known as King George's War). This was the first war after the religious and succession wars in England when King George I was placed on the English throne because no English born king could be trusted by the nobility. This allowed what is informally known as the ""Second Hundred Years War"" (1739 to 1815) between France and England to begin. France felt that it had been cheated in the actual Hundred Years War, but now that England had a King with personal holdings on the continent of Europe again (northern Germany), France would be able to fight England without having to cross the Channel.\n\nEvery conflict between France and England up to the final exile of Napolean Bonaparte would include fighting in every corner of the world (Canada, South America, Oceania, India, Europe, Africa, the whole world).\n\nAs you can see, the Revolutionary War is an excellent answer because France and England would fight in every corner of the world during it (after we stabbed France in the back by leaving the war in 1783, France would finally be defeated navally I believe in South America under Lord Hood's fleet), but it is still part of this Second Hundred Years War begun in 1739, as of course is the Napoleanic Wars. The Hundred Years War, the Wars of the Roman Empire, the Peloponesian War, etc, while they were the known world, they encompassed only Europe and parts of Africa.\n\nAgain, sorry to be splitting hairs here, but that is what I do. Let the dogs begin biting!",616

2,"Personality.? ; What is the the difference between a personality disorder, a borderline personality and why? Which is the toughest to assist and why? No websites please. ; ""Borderline Personality"" IS a personality disorder.  It's commonly misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder.  In some cases, it is used simply because it is a mix of many other disorders.\nA person with BPD is, in essence, self destructive.  Some may be sexually promiscuous, abuse drugs and/or alcohol, self-mutilate, and engage in compulsive behavior.\nA person with borderline personality is a hard case for most any doctor.  Some doctors agree that a borderline personality is hardest to treat because it takes so much to gain the patients trust.  This is because most people with BPD were abused (either sexually, physically, or emotionally) as children.  After the patients trust is gained, the patients and doctor then try to overcome compulsive behavior, a hard thing for any BPD to accomplish.\nAll in all, a borderline personality makes it difficult for others to assist in that they see everything in black and white; a person who is not their hero is their enemy, and can quickly become one or the other.",625

Some ""lottery"" teams however, have traded there draft picks for other players and are not part of the ""lottery"" (Knicks traded there 1st round pick to the Bulls for Eddie Curry).  \nAs for the picks themselves, the NBA uses a ping pong ball system.  The team that has the worst record will get the most amount of balls, the second worst gets the second most and so on, think KENO.  The balls are then chosen randomally to determine who picks first, second, etc. etc.  So even though the team with the worst record has more ping pong balls in the bowl, it doesn't necessarily mean they will choose first, they just have the best CHANCE.  This year Toronto got the first pick, but they did not have the worst record.",644

3,"Do the buttons you push to cross the street really do anything? ; You push them over and over, but do they really do anything?? ; Here is how I think it works.\n\nThe Pedestrian Stoplights and Traffic Stoplights have set schedules. For example, the traffic light and pedestrian light have a 3:1 minute ratio. Let's pretend the schedule starts at 12:00, the traffic light will be green from 12:00 to 12:03. Then the pedestrian light will be green from 12:03 to 12:04. The cycle continues: 12:04-12:07 is Traffic while the pedestrian is 12:07-12:08.\n\nNow I assume the pedestrian traffic light button has like an ""idle function"". For example, maybe if the button isn't pressed after 45 seconds then it becomes idle and the (12:03-12:04 section) will remain the green for traffic light. However, lets say you press the button at 12:05, the pedestrian light will not turn green until 12:07 because pressing the button doesn't change the light but brings it off idle and into the schedule.\n\nNow I didn't research this, it's just my assumption.

Yes, it works.\n\nOne need not meditate in a spiritual sense; many do it purely for physiological reasons...but I have always felt an innate presence within and all around me, so I began, when I was very young, to get still, so I could see what this presence was.  \n\nI feel the peace now even when not meditating, because I know it is always there.  The peace is completely unlike any concept of peace...nothing compares to it.",668
1,"if the space shuttle had a nuclear reactor on board, then it slows down and re-enter earth's atmosphere no hea ; is the heat problem upon re-entry of the shuttle because we do not have the power to match the earth's rotation exactly then re-enter? ; Yes the heat is because the shuttle is going about 17,000 mph or more.  But think about it... if we caused it to slow down to the earth's rotational speed, it would drop like a stone!  The shuttle is very non-aerodynamic, it's like flying a brick with small wings.  Without the speed, it would be impossible to maneuver it to base because after entering the atmosphere it's like a big clumsy glider.\n\nIf we were to glide in gently under power like a jet, it would have to be much more aerodynamic. So it's possible, and the people working on the X prize are doing just that.  \n\nBut you will not find nuclear energy on a spaceship any time soon.  The safety concerns of a nuclear reactor blowing up in our atmosphere and scattering radioactive dust are too great to allow for such a thing.",669

And when we met the first time it was for a date because we were kind of set up.  So it seems like maybe it was just expected of us to like each other.. and start holding hands and whatever.. it didn't just happen naturally.  We do not really have a connection.. like we arent all comfortable around eachother and able to talk to eachother...it seems more physical.  But I love being with him and stuff.

That's generally the number one problem I see in students that are having trouble motivating themselves to study - they're just not interested enough in the material.  If you're still a freshman or a sophomore and struggling with your lib ed requirements, that's understandable - but, if you're also having trouble studying for the classes in your major, then you may want to reassess.  I was in the same boat as you about 5 years ago.  Every time I tried to sit down and study, this wave of lethargy would sweep over me, making me very tired.  I've never napped so much as I did those first couple years of college.  I finally realized that I had less than no interest in the classes I was supposed to be really interested in, and took some time off to figure things out.  I'm not saying you necessarily need to stop going to school, but if your classes aren't exciting you, perhaps you should go talk to one of the academic advisors for undecided students.  They're trained to help you figure out what you're really interested in.  Good luck!",676

I was reading in this physics book about the effects of global warming and it stated that the rising levels of harmful chemical gases in the earth's atmosphere could damage the earth forever. It says the with the build up of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen, methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide in the earth's atmosphere, a giant chemical ring will form around the earth's atmosphere blocking sunlight coming into earth, so therefore the earth turns into ""lo"" one of jupiter's many moons.

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

1,"Why is there are sonic boom when planes make the sound barrier? ; What causes the sound? ; A sonic boom is the audible component of a shock wave in air. The term is commonly used to refer to the air shocks caused by the supersonic flight of military aircraft or passenger transports such as Concorde (Mach 2.03, no longer flying) and the Space Shuttle (Mach 27, has only flown once since the 2003 crash). Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion; typically the shock front may approach 167 megawatts per square meter, and may exceed 200 decibels.\n\nWhen an aircraft is near the sound barrier, an unusual cloud sometimes forms in its wake. A Prandtl-Glauert Singularity results from a drop in pressure, because of shock wave formation. This pressure change causes a sharp drop in temperature, which in humid conditions leads the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets and form the cloud",732

6,"How can you raise you credit score even when you pay on time? ; Ok, past credit messed me up. I have a judgement thats almost paid off. I am trying to raise my credit score.I have 3 new accounts that I've paid on time for over 1 year. I read that one way to raise your score is to "" piggy back"" on a relatives good credit ( have them add me to one of their good accounts and not use it) Is this safe, is it legal. I would love to hear constructive ways to increase my credit score. Please don't judge me. Almost all of my "" bad"" credit accounts have been paid off. I put my sons first when the divorce came. They lived in the house that I paid for while I lived in a basement. ; Here are a couple of things you can do to raise your credit score quickly. \n\n1) Have a relative with great credit add you to their credit card account. This can raise your score over 100 points instantly, and has not risk to them! Even though your relative can add your name to their credit card account, they don't have risk if they don't give you a credit card.\n\n2) Use your credit cards for monthly purchase, then pay balance down to zero every month. If you have the cash, this is a very quick way to raise your credit score. Remember, creditors cannot ""see"" your income from the credit report, but they can tell you have financial strength when you pay down your card balances every month. This technique can raise your credit score up to 80 points.\n\n3) Use time. Most people don't realize that a bad credit item has the most weight only in the first two months, then hurts your score even less after 6 months, and even less after 2 years. After 2 years, many bad credit items don't even hurt at all. I know a friend with 6 chargeoffs that are 4-6 years old and her credit score is 620, good enough to buy a house. Sometimes waiting even a month or two for a bad item to age is all you need for your credit score to bounce back. \n\nIt doesn't mean you are a bad person when you have a lower credit score. Bad things just happen. Good luck with your credit score!",748

7,"Disguise. Rate this Poem.

It's heartfelt and I used to write a lot and in High school I was picked best writer by the teachers. This poem seems as though you or whoever wrote this wasn't writing because they felt they had to but because these are feelings that plague them everyday. I feel that the only way to be a true writer is to be able to contact the feelings inside of you and bring them out in pictures instead of words and put those pictures into words on paper. It seems that's what the writer was doing and did a very good job at interpreting her own thoughts and pictures. That's what I do, I'm an only child so all I had was my own thoughts and imagination. Keep writing so you can get better and more refined and you could compile a book of poetry and get it published and make some good money off of it. Sorry that was my entrepreneurial side coming out of me. Good work though!!!! Practice makes perfect, you can be an excellent writer once you keep practicing and find your own style.

5,"Do any of you play Ultimate Frisbee? ; I play ultimate frisbee ; I first learned how to play Ultimate when I got into Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, New York. My friend who is a year older and went there told me that ""everyone"" plays Ultimate at Stuy. Being impressionable and younger, I figured I better learn too. I played for the boys' Sticky Fingers team through high school. I got to play at the high school national championships back when it was held in Washington DC.\n\nAfter high school, I went to Oberlin College in Ohio. I continued my Ultimate career by attending early season tryouts for the college team. There were barely enough people on the team to play 7-on-7 full size games. We played co-ed (mixed gender) in the fall, then single-gender in the spring (collegiate championships season). I eventually went on to captain the team, and the men's team made it to College Nationals.\n\nAfter college, I moved to Seattle, Washington, where I tried out for, but didn't make the second tier men's club team. I spent a season getting serious about training, and eventually made it onto one of the second tier teams. Continuing on with training, I eventually made it on to the top men's team in town. The team qualified for the club national championships where we finished second - losing to some team from Boston in the finals. I was put in for one point that game. (Which was pretty good considering there were earlier elimination games I didn't play in at all.)\n\nI eventually played for another evolution of a second tier men's team in town. After a few fun seasons with that team, I went on to start a co-ed (mixed gender) team. We finished well in the regional championships, but never good enough to make it to Nationals.\n\nMore than 22 years after I first started playing Ultimate, I once again live in Brooklyn, New York, and play casual pick-up Ultimate in Prospect Park a couple of times a month. I also regularly do yoga and get massage and acupuncture therapy for my aches and pains from years of Ultimate.\n\nI sometimes see the latest Stuyvesant High School boys Ultimate team practicing while I'm out in the park with my kid.",754

WHAT IF TECHNOLOGY  BECAME SO ADVANCE THAT IT COULD READ THOUGHTS ? ; It isn't a question, but three.\n\n-  What if people were (misspelling) so completely controlled by a powerful government (I can't understand the rest WHAT is like everyone else)?  Maybe you mean that everyone would be like everyone else?\n\nThe simple answer is Communism, a failed political and economic system.  The system fails because it doesn't encourage competition or development.  With complete government control all resources would be divided by the government or used for their projects.  There is always a limit on resources, not everyone in the US can get a cell phone, a big screen TV, and HDTV service.  Some people just can’t afford it all.  So some people have to do without.  Who determines how much of a resources is needed for a task.  If a building required all the available wood in the region then it would be sent there, but since the boss likes to make birdhouses he takes some for himself.  So what happens to you when you can’t get the wood to build your doghouse, or to repair your own house?\n\nAnother big problem is that since there are always shortages in a non-perfect supply system it encourages corruption.  In the above situation the boss might save some wood for you in return for sexual favors, is that fair?  There are only so many doctors available, so who would decide which one gets treatment?  The people in power would get the best health care and those who were not in power would have to make do with the rest.  All the best equipment and medicines would be transferred to those hospitals with the result of people dieing, when they could have been saved.  Is this fair, well if you are a family member of one of the rulers then it would seem fair to you?  Who would decide?\n\nIt is impossible to make everyone just like everyone else.  If you do that then the smart people would have to acts less intelligent, while the less intelligent would be responsible for more than they can handle.  How do you change everyone’s looks, say goodbye to beauty; everyone would look just the same.  If a government had this power then they would make all redheads and all blondes dye their hair black or brunette.  What happens to those with perfect vision?  Most people don’t have perfect vision, it deteriorates with time and eventually some people won’t be able to get it corrected to 20/20.  So what do you plan on doing?  Do you make everyone wear glasses so their vision will all be downgraded or upgraded to the norm?  What about the blind, or do you just kill them all off?\n\n-  What if all competition was removed from society?\n\nAgain communism is the simple answer.\nAnother good answer is illustrated by the TV Show (PBS) Guns, Germs and Steel.  The reason why most primitive societies haven't advanced as far as others is because they didn't need to.  The pressures of their environment are less so they don't need to improve things.  When all you have to do for breakfast is go outside and chuck a spear then why invent a supermarket, and all that is required to build it?  Why bother to invent a brass spear or even a rock knife if you didn’t need it?\n\nCompetition forces advancements and development (as per Darwin's theory of Evolution).  Without competition the species stagnates and eventually dies.  Why run the race when you can’t win, why bother to enter the race at all?  The points on Yahoo Answers don’t mean very much, but most people like to gather points for bragging rights.  If there wasn’t a point system then why bother to answer any questions, or ask them?  Competition is basic to what we do and how we live.  Viruses compete against the body’s immune system.  When your body defeats a virus then it keeps immunity to that virus for a very long time.  Once you get Chicken Pox then you are immune to them.  Without that competition you could get infected every single time you are exposed.  The same is true in our society competition is needed to improve.\n\n-  What if technolo",856

About 6% of teen girls and 5% of college-aged females are believed to suffer from bulimia. \n\nBulimics are also susceptible to other compulsions, affective disorders, or addictions. Unlike anorexics, bulimics experience significant weight fluctuations, but their weight loss is usually not as severe or obvious as anorexics. \n\nThe secrecy of bulimia stems from the shame that bulimics often attach to the disorder. Binge eating is not triggered by intense hunger. It is a response to depression, stress, or other feelings related to body weight, shape, or food. Binge eating often brings on a feeling of calm or happiness (euphoria), but the self-loathing because of the overeating soon replaces the short-lived euphoria. \n\nOften, the individual will feel an impairment or loss of control during the binge eating and the purging becomes a way of regaining control. Not all bulimics engage in self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas during the current episode. Some may fast for days following a binge episode. Others may resort to excessive exercise as a method to regain their control and rid their body of the possible weight gained during the binge. Excessive exercise is that which interferes with normal daily activities or when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when it continues despite illness or injury.\n\nPatients with bulimia present a variety of medical and psychological complications which are usually considered to be reversible through a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Treatment can be managed by either a physician, psychiatrist, or in some cases, a clinical psychologist. The extent of the medical complications generally dictates the primary treatment manager. A psychiatrist, with both medical and psychological training, is perhaps the optimum treatment manager. \n\nSome patients may require hospitalization due to the extent of the medical or psychological complications. Others may seek outpatient programs. Still others may require only weekly counseling and monitoring by a practitioner. Stabilization of the patient's physical condition will be the immediate goal if the individual is in a life-threatening state. The primary goals of treatment should address both physical and psychological needs of the patient in order to restore physical health and normal eating patterns. The patient needs to identify internal feelings and distorted beliefs that led to the disorder initially. An appropriate treatment approach addresses underlying issues of control, self-perception, and family dynamics. Nutritional education and behavior management provides the patient with healthy alternatives to weight management. Group counseling or support groups can assist the patient in the recovery process as well.\n\nThe ultimate goal should be for the patient to accept herself and lead a physically and emotionally healthy life. Restoration of physical and mental health will probably take time, and results will be gradual. Patience is a vital part of the recovery process. A positive attitude coupled with much effort on the part of the affected individual is another integral component to a successful recovery.",858

9,"what (see details)? ; what the difference between the office of prime minster and president( some countries like iraq have both) ; A President is an executive, meaning they oversee the enactment of laws. Sometimes, like in the US, the President has certain power over legislation, in the form of a veto, but that is fairly limited. The President is elected by name. That is, you don't vote for ""Republican"" not knowing who the President might actually end up being.\n\nA Prime Minister, on the other hand, is a member of parliament and has no power to enforce laws. He is the head of the parliament and directs the creation of laws. Further, he is not elected by name. Instead, people vote for individual representatives in parliament for their district (like how we vote for Representatives), and the party that receives a majority of seats (or coalition of parties if none has a majority) votes for who among them should be prime minister.\n\nIn countries that have both, the President has very little power and is mainly a ceremonial position, much like the Queen in England.",876

4,"Wireless Connection Keeps Disconnecting? ; I have a laptop that works perfectly when connected to my wireless network; however, whenever I am connected to a friend's network, I am constantly kicked off every 30 seconds or so.  The other people using this network don't have any problems.  Is this a configuration issue? ; It might be a configuration issue or as the other person stated a problem with the access point you are trying to connect to as well.   Part of the answer will depend how on well you know your equipment and the equipment your trying to connect to.  There are multiple versions of the 802.11 versions out there. A B G N as previously mentioned, I don't believe N has been ratified yet, and it is unlikely you have A.  Probably 802.11B or 802.11G which are pretty standard installs in most machines.  You can start by making sure that you are compatibale with the access point your are trying to connect to.  Wireless networks can be set to only accept clients from certain bands, such as only G or B clients.  If your sure you have interoperability, then check to make sure the SSID or the broadcast name of the AP is also setup in your machine.  Most SSIDs are broadcast openly and will allow a machine to connect even if the connection is unsecured and will do this automatically.  If the SSID is not broadcasting you'll have to get the name and setup a new SSID.  I have noticed on XP that sometimes, it will note the connection is unsecured and wants confirmation before connection is established.  There are diagnostic tools in most laptop machines that will give you more information that will help decide where your problem is coming from.  If the connection is not using defaults, you may be experiencing issues from a security standpoint.  More advanced users will setup security on the AP itself which will require a WEP key before connection is established.  You'll have to find out if this is the case.  Another common problem I have seen with people attempting to connect to an AP is ad-hoc networks.  People initally setting up a SSID will tell the machine to create a connection where the laptop/machine itself becomes similar to a AP although more for a peer-to-peer connection, without ever realizing it.  If your familiar with XP, it uses different icons to distinguish between ad-hocs and APs.  If you are getting stronger connection to an ad-hoc and have not told your machine to connect to an AP infrastructure by default it can also attempt to use the ad-hoc before the AP.  ( Change this on the Advanced button on the bottom of the Wireless network connection properties window.)  On a XP machine, it will usually give you an indicator in the taskbar on the right, with some idea of what might be wrong.  If your connection is leaving you without an IP address you might try to verify that the connection you are trying to establish is the correct one.  Worst comes to worse, remove all the SSIDs that are located under the wireless network connection properties window and try to reconnect.  Right clicking on the wireless icon will also give you the option to View Available Wireless Networks, which might also give you an idea of the problem.\nI am of course assuming your running an XP machine and are familiar enough to find most of the spots I have mentioned.\nHope this helps you figure out your problem.",879

This is because our society is built on trust.  All the time we trust people not to do curtain things (like blow-up the place you are in).

My chem teacher is really old and he doesnt explain things well at all. Any help would be greatful! =) ; Okie dokie. First, you balance out the equation. You want to make sure you have the same amount of sodium, phospohorous, and oxygen atoms on each side of the ""yield"" sign. The outcome could be 12Na+P(little 4)+8O(little 2) Yields 4(Na(little 3)PO(little4)). Then you use your periodic table to tell you how many grams per mole are in Na(little3)PO(little 4). The molar mass is 164 g. You only have 156 g, which means you have 0.95 moles (156/164). Now you know that you have half as many moles of oxygen, therefore you only have 0.475 moles of O2. Now all you have to do is do 0.475 moles of O(;little 2) multiplied by its molar mass, which is 32 grams. This will give you 15.2 grams of O(little 2).

Now that you know the general shape, you need a few points on the graph in order to help you graph it. So, let's find the x and y intercept. \n\nTo find the y intercept, you sub x = 0 into the above equation, which leads to 3. Now, you know one point (0,3).\n\nTo find the x intercept, the easiest way is to use the quadratic formula:\n\nFor an equation y = Ax^2 + Bx + C\nx = [- B ± sqrt(B^2 - 4AC)] / (2A)\n\nIn your equation, A = -16, B = 80, C = 3. Sub these information into the quadratic formula, you get\n\nx = [- 80 ± sqrt(6592)]/(-32)\n\nFurther simplify this expression, you get\n\nx = [80 ± 8*sqrt(103)]/32\nx = [10 ± sqrt(103)]/4\nThis leads to two answers, x ~ 5.04 and x ~ -0.037. So, the two x intercepts are (5.04, 0) and (-0.037, 0).\n\nNow you have three points: (0,3), (5.04, 0), and (-0.037, 0). Put these on a coordinate, with the general shape in mind (quadratic facing downwards), it should be very obvious how the function should look like. Hope that helps.",943

6,"i need advice on how to make money on real estate buy remodel and sell? ; i have 10 + years carpentery exp drywall painting hardwood floor install sand finish ; Remember you only make money when you BUY a property, not when you sell it.  That means that you have to ""make"" your money when you buy the house.  Make sure you have enough equity in the house upfront to:\n\n1.  Repair the house for sale.  This includes all remodeling, landscaping, etc.\n2.  Carry the costs of ownership of the house while the repairs are happening.  If you take 45 days to repair the house, make sure you have 2 months worth of mortgage payments onhand.  This is called ""carrying costs""\n3.  Pay the real estate agents.  Typically you will need to pay between 4-6% of your selling price in commissions to sell the house, depending on your area.  If you don't use a realtor, you can save that fee, but you might not get your property sold in a timely fashion and may eventually get less money for the house.\n4.  Cover the capital gains tax.  Remember, short term flips are taxed at 25% federal and (in CA) 9% state.  Make sure you get sound tax advice before you spend your profits.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to find out what the comps are like in the area, offer 70-80% of the comp value (this is CA, by the way .. if you aren't in a ""hot"" market, like CA, HI, FL, NY, etc, then offer 50-60%).  This should give you enough room to carry the loan, rehab the house and, to quote The Steve Miller Band, ""Take the money and run!""",950

1,"How does consuming alcohol affect ones body temperature, particularly in cold conditions? ; I am a bicycle messenger in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. Tommorow the temperature is supposed to be -30 Celsius. Also it will snow and be a slow day. So to keep warm is it really a good idea to take a flask of scotch on route?\nWhat would be the best alternatives as far as diet is concerned for maximum heat? ; Contrary to what is believed, alcohol may make you feel warmer but it actually lowers the temperature of the body. When alcohol enters the blood, it causes the blood vessels to widen.  More blood flows to the skin's surface.  The drinker's body temperature drops as the increased blood flow to the surface allows body heat to escape.  People who drink alcohol in cold weather to get warm actually accomplish the opposite.\n\nThough carbohydrates are known to be the best source of heat and energy, all what you eat are actually contributing in producing your body heat. So eat a well balanced diet and wear sufficient clothing to combat coldness while you go out. Instead of bringing a flask of scotch on route why not bring a flask of hot drinks instead?☺",960

2,"Mirena or Paraguard? Which is more healthy? Are there significant amounts of hormones in the Mirena IUD? ; I have had problems with the Pill's hormones and having migranes. I went off the Pill and now I don't experience the migraines I used to. I want to get an IUD but don't know which one would be best for my health. Do the hormones in the Mirena IUD cause migraines in anyone? I know that Mirena is the most effective, I just don't want to suffer with migraines because of it. Advice please. ; Mirena IUD:\nHow it works:  It is inserted into the uterus and is about the size of a quarter.  Mirena contains a type of progestin called levonorgestrel, which blocks sperm and alters the lining of the uterus, interrupting implantation of a fertilized egg.  Modern IUD's don't pose a high risk of pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility.  In fact, the hormone in Mirena helps shrink uterine fibroids, decreases menstrual cramping, can reduce blood loss by 97% and may lower your risk of endometrial cancer. If the birth control pill you were taking contained levonorgestrel then you might get migraines from the IUD, but it is unlikely since you are not ingesting the hormone.  It provides protection for 5 years.\n\nParagard IUD:\nHow it works: It is inserted the same way as Mirena, but it works differently; instead of hormones, Paragard contains copper, which kills sperm.  It provides protection for 10 years. Research shows that Paragard may lower your risk of developing endometrial cancers, though experts aren't sure why.  \n\nThere is also an an implant that is not yet available, but will be soon, called Implanon.  A single matchsticklike implant is inserted into your upper arm.  The implant, which should be approved by the FDA this year, releases a low dose of Progestin into your body. It blocks ovulation and thickens cervical mucus so the sperm cannot enter for up to three years.  It is 100% effective, whereas the Paragard and Mirena is only 99% and 99.9% effective.",965

Say something like, ""Dude!  Need my personal space please!"" (and gesture the amount of personal space you would like) or ""Quit trying to wrestle with me!"" or ""Hey, don't mess the 'do!""  Or have your husband jokingly step in and pull you away and put his arm around you, saying ""Hey, this one's mine, yours is over there!""\n\nIf he doesn't take the hint, you can try approaching him discreetly and privately, and telling him that while you enjoy his company, the physical rough-housing isn't as much fun for you, he doesn't know his own strength, you prefer a little more personal space, etc.  Or you can go to  your friend and ask her to talk with him.

Do you recommend a mediocre student for this major?\nThank you! ; I was a biology major (unofficially) my freshman year, and I got a GOOD taste of what it is like. I can tell you right now the hardest class for most people is organic chemistry. It was hard for me, and I had no trouble in calculus, 300 level (for juniors) biology classes, and I absolutely aced the general chem classes. You have to memorize a ton of material, AND understand the concepts inside out. Actually, organic wasn't that bad, but I dropped it mid-semester because after reading 300 pages of chemical structures and reactions, I was bored to the point of insanity, and we all know it is hard to do well in something if you're bored. I did have a bad teacher too though.The biology classes seem like more memorization than anything else, so if you have a good memory like me, you should do well in them, but of course you need a basic understanding of chemistry to do well in biology. As always though, if you are truly interested in the subject (I don't think I was), you can succeed.",1023

You won't be deserting him.  He'll live.  And perhaps his aunt and uncle do have it good, but it's not about what we have here on earth.

When sexual abuse happens a person's sense of themselves, esteem, their understanding of healthy boundaries are completely screwed up.  This is why THERAPY is SO important.  You cannot blame yourself for what happened with your father.  Your need to want to do anything to keep him comes as a product of your earlier abuse.  The line between appropriate and inappropriate - and being able to say NO - got lost when it happened to you earlier.  Generally people who go on for years without help will find themselves in positions where they are taken advantage of (and allow that to happen - because they don't realize it at the time) and until you get the help - this will continue to happen.  \n\nShame is a huge piece of this.  Your father is an adult too and he should have known better (if not more) than to have sex with his own daughter.  You cannot blame yourself. It sounds like you need to do a lot of forgiving of yourself.  Please go and get some help - if you don't you will continue to live in this cycle of pain and shame and only you will be to blame.  What happened to you was awful - but you are an adult now and have the means to get the help you couldn't when you were younger.  There are many support groups that are free, and counselling offered - talk to friends - your doctor - look in the phone book and call up different places.  Ask lots of questions. In the meantime you can't change what happened with your father - you made a mistake - but YOU are NOT a mistake.  Stop being hard on yourself.

However, CRM is not a technology itself, but rather a holistic approach to an organisation's philosophy, placing the emphasis firmly on the customer.\n\nCRM governs an organization's philosophy at all levels, including policies and processes, front of house customer service, employee training, marketing, systems and information management. CRM systems are integrated end-to-end across marketing, sales, and customer service.\n\nA CRM system should:\n\nIdentify factors important to clients. \nPromote a customer-oriented philosophy \nAdopt customer-based measures \nDevelop end-to-end processes to serve customers \nProvide successful customer support \nHandle customer complaints \nTrack all aspects of sales \nCreate a holistic view of customers' sales & services information",1083

There cheques and Postal Orders. I know it takes longer to clear, but Ill keep all the money I actually sold it at. Im not sure how postal orders work though. I dont know what to do.I have looked on the ebay site, but it doesnt help me, just confuses me. Anyone who doesnt use paypal, please can you let me know what you do? thanks! x ; Postal orders are the best way if you want the money asap. Cheques are ok if you want the money to go into your bank account and don't mind waiting a few days. I know what you mean when it's comes to paypal especially when selling something on ebay. You get charged by ebay for listing the item then you get charged again by ebay at the end of the month and then paypal charge you for using their services and then they charge you again if you transfer funds into a bank account. You don't seem to really gain anything using ebay or paypal.\n\nPostal Orders are the best bet. Just take them the post office and they will cash them for you.",1084

I'm confused about my score because this is the new SAT or whatever...is this a pretty good score? Next year I want to go to either University of Texas Austin, University of Miami FL, or Pepperdine. Do I have a pretty good chance at getting into one of these with this? What is this score equivelant to compared to the old SAT? I also got a 26 on the ACT. Which score do you think I should submit? ; That SAT score puts you around the 80 percentile which isn't bad.  Under the old system I think it would have been around an 1200.  A 26 on the ACT puts you very near the 80% percentile as well if I'm not mistaken.  Both of those are ""above average"" scores.\n\nAs far as whether that will get you into UT Austin the answer is probably not by itself. It's still worth a shot however, just be sure to include the best references and essay you can.\n\nI applied to UTA and Texas A&M with slightly higher scores (1280 under the old system and a 28ACT) and was declined but they both offered to let me attend satellite schools on a kind of probationary period with the option of transferring to the central schools after a year.  \n\nI ended up getting a free ride at UT Tyler and have enjoyed it enough that I never pursued transferring to Austin.  \n\nI’m not familiar enough with Miami or Pepperdine to answer that part of your question but I hope this helps.\n\nBest of Luck!\nArmus",1097

Typing isn't just slow in Word. It's slow in emails and on the Web and everything else. Is there anything I can do to speed it up? I have Mac OS Extended. ; A G3 isn't exactly the lastest in computer technology.  Your processor is about what 700/800MHz right? and I think they have about 32/64MB of RAM so the applications you have installed could really be killing you processing power.  Despite all that though, the slow typing is a syptom of something much bigger than just a few applications hogging your resources since it doesn't take much processing power to output to screen.  You most likely have a ton of spyware on your system that's sending nformation all over the net about you and your machine and your kids.  The best way to remove this is an antivirus program with spyware checkers (most of them have that now) or you can get a dedicated spyware checker like ad-aware but I'll prefer the antivirus so that you could scan for viruses as well.  Most big name developers like Norton and McAfee have versions for both Mac OS and Windows and I'm pretty sure Apple have it's own antivirus program on thier site or some patches or something so you shouldn't have to much trouble locating one.",1110

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",1179

Now that I'm actively weight training again, it's really bothering me and affecting my quality of life.  Before restarting weight training, the pain was merely a minor nuisance, something I could easily live with.  I had it looked at, and the doctors basically said I could come in and get steroid injections every couple of months to manage the pain, or I could have rotator cuff surgery.  I've talked to a few folks that have had the surgery, and NONE of them have anything good to say about it.  They said the post-operative pain was bad, and it took several months or longer to heal.  What do you think? ; Basically you have 2 choices stop doing activities that cause you pain or have the surgery.  The surgery consists of a plastic screw being inserted into the shoulder, the tendon is then weaved into another piece of flat plastic that is then attached to the screw to hold the tendon into place.  The recuperation time is around 6 months and you'll need physical therapy during that time.  It takes along time to heal because there's no way to actually reattach the tendon permanently.  The plastic just holds it into place while the tendon reattaches itself to the bone.  The pain of the surgery can be quite intense but pain medication is provided.\nHope this  helps.",1210

Do it in the windows safe mode. (AVG and avast antivirus softwares are free while a 6 month free trial for Norton is available at pack.google.com. Lavasoft's free Ad-Aware is the best antispyware to my knowledge. Also Windows Defender from Microsoft is good enough for real-time protection). This should identify the problem and most probably would solve it as well. However, if the antivirus software is unable to delete the malware, go to thier website and search for the name of the malware detected. Their must be some instructions posted to tackle the problem. You might have to delete the system restore points and as well delete the particular registry entries manually if the virus still regenerates on subsequent boot up of the machine. Good Luck.\n\nPS. If you are still having trouble, use Hijack This and copy the log it generates and post it on some tech help forum. I am sure there will be plenty of people ready to help you out.",1230

Many people know that the celebration of Christmas on December 25 was just a catholic means to fool the pagans into using their celebrations of the winter equinox as a religious event. True Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus every day. The Bible doesn’t say exactly when Jesus was born, but if you have ever been to Israel you know that the shepherds are not watching there flocks by night all seated on the ground. Any shepherd worth his salt has his sheep in a shelter and he is home in front of a good fire as winter in Israel can get very cold.\nHalloween- This one should be obvious. Christians or even JW don’t allow for the celebrating of demons. \nMother’s day and Father’s Day- This is just basics, the commandments say we should honor our Father and Mother… That means all the time not one just a special day.\nBirthday- Here is where the JW’s get a little strange; in a birthday celebration for King Herod a young girl pleases him with her dance. He gives his word that she can have anything she wanted. What she wanted was the head of john the Baptist on a platter. Herod granted this wish.

I need some advice on how you all did it and also what were some of your experiences. ; I quit after 38 years by using nicotine replacement + a support group.  I was highly motivated to quit because I was scheduled for elective surgery and I understood that stopping smoking was the single best thing I could do to increase my chances for a successful surgical outcome.  \n\nResearch has indicated that using nic replacement increases the successs rate of quit attempts.  I had tried to stop cold turkey several times but always fell off the wagon and had given up trying - until my surgery date was looming.  Amazing how that motivates a person!\n\nI never tried this drug but some quitters have also been helped by using the drug Wellbutrin, a prescription medication.  Some have combined it with nic replacement to increase their chance of success.\n\nI guess the best advice I could give is that if you fail, try again.  Every attempt to quit, whether you last a week or a month, gives you useful experience and information about your habit and what smoking does for you that can help you the next time you try.  Don't stop trying.\n\nOn the issue of weight gain, I found that I have a strong oral craving - if it isn't a cigarette in my mouth, then it's food.  With oral nic replacement products (gum or lozenges) there is less likelihood that you'll overeat because the oral cravings are somewhat satisfied by the nic replacement product.  This isn't the case, of course, with the patch.  I didn't gain weight during the time I used nic gum.  I did gain about 10 lbs later.  Unless you eat yourself out of house and home, there is no reason to gain a lot of weight (I don't consider 10 lbs. a lot of weight).  However, if you eat instead of smoking, then yes, gaining weight is likely.  I took up walking instead of smoking.  Anything but eating!",1344

Which is why a really big submarine needs really big propellers to go.\nThird law - To every action (force applied) there is an equal but opposite reaction (equal force applied in the opposite direction).

Antartica is also a desert.\n\nIn geography, a desert is a landscape form or region that receives little precipitation. Generally deserts are defined as areas that receive an average annual precipitation of less than 250 mm (10 inches).\n\nDeserts have a reputation for supporting very little life. Compared to wetter regions this may be true, although deserts often have high biodiversity, including animals that remain hidden (especially during the daylight) to preserve moisture. About one-fifth of Earth's land surface is desert.\n\nDesert landscapes have certain features. Deserts are often composed of sand and rocky surfaces. Sand dunes called ergs and stony or hamada surfaces compose a minority of desert surfaces. Exposures of rocky terrain are typical, and reflect minimal soil development and sparseness of vegetation. Bottom lands may be salt-covered flats. Eolian (wind-driven) processes are major factors in shaping desert landscapes. Cold deserts have similar features but the main form of precipation is snow rather than rain. The largest cold desert is Antarctica (composed of about 98 percent thick continental ice sheet and 2 percent barren rock). The largest hot desert is the Sahara.",1406
2,"Does anybody know about the graysheet diet? ; I heard that this was a diet that OA used years ago. ; Every year Americans invest billions of dollars in weight loss diets and gimmicks, many of which yield few results. However, the lure of quick, easy weight loss is hard to resist. Despite ineffective tools, most hopeful consumers are willing to give the next weight loss fad a chance. If you're planning to start a new diet, it is important to remember the following information.\nFood-specific diets: Have you ever tried the cabbage diet or the fruit-only diet? These are just a couple of examples of diets that promote one ""specific"" food that causes weight loss. No matter how much you think you'll enjoy ice cream at every meal, inevitably you will get bored with eating the same food repeatedly. As a result, you'll eat less food than needed to maintain your weight. This type of diet will not teach you healthier eating habits or provide a balance of nutrients, and consequently is not effective for long-term weight loss.\n\nHigh-protein, low-carbohydrate diets: One of the most recent trends in dieting, these diets are based on the concept that carbohydrates are ""bad"" and that everyone has some degree of insulin resistance, resulting in poor carbohydrate metabolism. Many proponents of these diets suggest that including carbohydrates in your diet will cause weight gain. The reality, though, is that eating more calories (whether as carbohydrate, fats, or protein) than you burn will cause weight gain.\n\nHigh-fiber, low-calorie diets: As I've noted in many previous blog entries, fiber-rich foods play an important role in a healthy diet. They are a helpful ingredient of weight loss efforts because they provide bulk to the diet, which helps you feel fuller sooner. Be careful, though: if you plan to increase the fiber in your diet, be sure to increase your fluid intake at the same time or you may experience cramping, bloating, and constipation. High-fiber diets will help with weight loss only if you restrict calories in conjunction with addition of extra grains, fruits and vegetables.\n\nLiquid diets: Consumers face a couple of different liquid diet options. Your local grocery store and pharmacy sell over-the-counter liquid meal replacements, which can be expensive and frequently add extra calories to daily consumption if not managed carefully. On the other hand are liquid diets that require medical supervision. These diets are usually very low in calories and may result in metabolic abnormalities if dieters are not carefully monitored. Neither type of liquid diet should be used for long‑term weight loss unless monitored by a health care professional. Radically changing your caloric intake in this way will not result in long-term behavior modification and healthy eating patterns.\n\nFasting: As a way to cleanse the body or jump-start a weight-loss program, fasting has been recommended for years. However, all that fasting really does is deprive your body of nutrients and decrease your energy, leaving you feeling weak and lightheaded. If the right nutrients are not available for your cells to use as energy, your liver will convert fat stores to ketones for use as energy (ketosis). Long-term ketosis can be harmful to your health. \nNo fad diet or gimmick will work magic for safe and effective weight loss. The following are some suggestions for ensuring a long-term healthy eating plan and getting your weight loss efforts off to an encouraging start: \nEat a variety of foods. Remember, a balanced diet will ensure that you get all necessary nutrients. \n\nGet some physical activity every day. Calories in must be less than calories out to ensure successful weight loss. To keep ""calories out"" at a healthful level, make you get at least 30 minutes of physical activity every day.\n\nInclude sources of fiber in your diet. They will add bulk and give you a feeling of fullness.\n\nChoose a diet low in fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol. You do need to consume some fat for good health. Aim for no more t",1407

I am not a people pleaser, i say yes because i generally think i can do things in a certian time frame but it never works out like that.

Are you committed to getting the job done?  It sounds like you are.  Problem one solved.\n\nProblem two is that your tasks are taking longer than you expected.  Have you examined why they are taking longer?  Is it because you did not have all of the information or tools available?  Is it because the tasks were more complex than you originally thought?  Is it because you've allowed interruptions or other time-wasters to interfere?  Do you have a grasp of how long it typically takes you to accomplish certain tasks?\n\nIt does sound like it is a matter of understanding the time needed to complete tasks.  I would recommend the first step is some self-observation. Keep of a log of what you do and when you do it for a week.

(eg. public service ads).\n\n\nPlease also see similar question on use of silence... ; Music is a vitally important ingredient in TV advertising. To see how cleverly it is used, record a few on video and play them over a few times. My best example is Pampers where a mother asks a baby to get up from the floor and walk over to her and father says the baby cannot move because of the nappy. The music is baby-like during this phase. The ad then cuts to the benefits of Pampers and then back to the baby who does get up and walk across the room. Almost imperceptibly, the music changes to a kind of triumphal sound. On one watching, you would be unaware of it. Only by playing the ad over can you hear the mood that is created. In answer to your other questions, try replaying and noting how many different camera set ups there were in a 15 or 30 second ad, then analyse the story being told, then listen to see how sound, including music, adds atmosphere.",1459

8,"What Should I Tell My Son? ; My exhusband and I were never together as a couple for as long as our son was born 3 1/2 years ago. My ex lives in Georgia and I live with our son in Louisiana. I am engaged and we live with my fiancee and we're expecting another baby boy in a week :). My ex husband has not seen our son since June 2005. He has talked to our son once or twice on the phone since then. He hasn't sent pictures or anything like that. He just recently sent a child support payment. Anyways, I made a picture book for our son that has all of the pictures of his father in it. These are pictures from our son's birth and some visitations that he has come to. It's our son's own special little book. Well, the other night, he all of the sudden said that he wanted to look at his daddy book so he pulled it off the shelf and sat on the floor with it. Then, he looked up at me and my fiancee and said ""I need to see my daddy. I miss my daddy."" This really broke my heart. (continued in details below) ; Before you do anything like that, I would sit down with the little guy and try to find out what he really means.  Kids that age may mean something completely different than what we take from their statements.  They just don't have a wide range of emotional vocabulary.  Anyway, see if what he really means is something more manageable for you.  Like, maybe assurance of your love for him even though a new little one is coming to steal you away from him.\n\nAnd if he really wants to communicate with his father, maybe a phone call will be enough.  Or maybe let him make a card to send to his father.  That might be enough to satisfy him so he can move on.\n\nYou can also redirect his attention to something more tangible.  Like making another book, but this time with people he's close to and sees frequently.\n\nI think in the end, you'll just have to try things that are possible for you to do until you run out of options.  I wouldn't tell him anything that would hurt his feelings, though.  I think I would make up something sooner than I would do that (and I hate to lie).",1464

I did get both sides to zero. I don't even know how to begin explaining it.\n\nFor the sake of typing this with some readability, let (k+1) = b and (k+2) = c.\n\nFirst you subtract (2^c)/(k+3) from both sides to get 0 on one side. Then to get a common denominator, you multiply top and bottom of the first term by (k+3) and top and bottom of the third term by (k+2). You get:\n\n[ (k+3)(2^b) + (k+1)(2^b) - (k+2)(2^c) ] / [ (k+2)(k+3) ] = 0\n\nThen you distribute out the terms:\n\n[ k(2^b) + 3(2^b) + k(2^b) + (2^b) - k(2^c) - 2(2^c) ] / [ (k+2)(k+3) ]\n\nThen you factor out 2^b from the first four terms:\n\n[ (2^b)(k + 3 + k + 1) - k(2^c) - 2(2^c) ] / [ (k+2)(k+3) ]\n\nThen you combine like terms on the left four. On the right two, you reduce the exponent by one and multiply the term by two. Since c is one more than b, this turns (2^c) into (2^b). You can do this since it's an exponent on two:\n\n[ (2k + 4)(2^b) - 2k(2^b) - 4(2^b) ] / [ (k+2)(k+3) ]\n\nYou can factor 2^b out of the right two terms to get:\n\n[ (2k + 4)(2^b) - (2k + 4)(2^b) ] / [ (k+2)(k+3) ] = 0\n\nThe two terms in the numerator cancel out:\n\n0 / [ (k+2)(k+3) ] = 0\n\nAnd:\n\n0 = 0\n\nI must admit that I liked this problem.

They are checking their own feelings with the feelings of others, because it is oftentimes dangerous to express feelings which deviate substantial for the common viewpoint.  Understanding and empathizing with social norms allows one's perspective to be framed in acceptable ways.\n\nThey are also evaluating the basis for social norms for predictability and for consistency, while ensuring that their own basis is more firmly grounded.  They are looking for reasons to believe that others are rational in believing things which seem so irrational.\n\nInstead of asking ""Is this good or bad .."" questions, I tend to ask, ""How do you feel about ..

5,"Y is that the '82 Brazil team is consider by many the best BRAZL team even tho they didnt get to the final? ; Every one tells me that the 1982 brazil team is the best team ever even though they didn't win the championship, why??!!!!!!!!!! ; The 1982 Brazil team played some of the best attacking football ever seen, and has some great players in the team. Sitting back to defend just wasn't in their vocabulary, and in the build up to the world cup they swept all aside with some breath taking displays.\n\nThey started the world cup finals well too. They comfortably qualified top of their group, to enter a second group stage. They were unfortunate though, because in the second group stage they did not face weaker teams, as the draw had been designed to produce, but defending champions Argentina and Italy, both of whom had started slowly in the competition. However, they beat Argentina 3-1, and only needed a draw to progress to the next round against Italy.\n\nItaly started well, and scored an early goal, but Brazil piled on the pressure and brought the game back to 1-1. At this point, they only had to close up shop and see the game out - but that wasn't their mentality. They carried on attacking, and left themselves venerable at the back. The Italians scored again, and led until 20 minutes from the end, when Brazils attacking play finally made it 2-2.\n\nAnother defensive mistake was to blame for the third Italian goal, and thanks to some heroics from the Italian keeper Zoff, the game finished 3-2.\n\nBrazil had been knocked out, but had played some superb football and had, perhaps, reminded people across the world how football could be played.\n\nFor this reason there 1982 team will always be remembered as one of the greatest teams of all time.",1506

She cannot or will not return because her government cannot or will not protect her."" In other words, to be a refugee in ANY country, you must prove that this is the case. (Shouldn't be that hard as you are Iraqi.)\n\nIt looks like many Iraqis have fled to Syria and Jordan, while others have fled to Saudia Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran. However, if large numbers of Iraqis continue to seek refugee status in these countries, people are worried that it might upset the balance of power and caue more disruption in the area.\nOutside of the Middle East, it looks like Sweden is a choice. Apparently they have lax immigration laws. Britain and Denmark, on the other hand, are becoming more strict.\n\nFor the US, things are less clear. For starters, you would have to deal with Homeland Security, not an easy task. It looks like there are two ways to become a refugee in the US. The first is to apply for refugee status at the embassy. The second is to get a different visa, go to the US and then apply for refugee status when you arrive.\n\nFor the best information about applying to asylum in another country, I suggest you contact the embassy of the country to which you wish to flee, Amnesty International or some other NGO, or, if you have money and need to get out quickly, some sort of human smuggler. \nSome websites are listed below with articles about Iraqi refugees.\nGood luck!",1521

He did so. A year later, my friend got a letter from Getty Images saying, in a nutshell, that he owes them $1000 because he has a copyrighted image on his website. There was no prior cease-and-desist letter, though they apparently knew he started using the picture a year ago. He called the web designer, who said that he grabbed the image off a free-image website via a Google search (he can no longer locate that particular website), and that the image has no copyright imprint on it. He's not sure what to do and has until Dec. 1 to pay, oer Getty Images' demand letter. Anyone know what he should do? Your advice would be greatly appreciated. ; Advice: Get an attorney.\nThis really depends upon any contract he had with the website developer.  There could be an argument that, in absence of a ""work for hire"" agreement, that the webdesigner owns the copyright on the website, and your friend's business shouldn't be sued.  Certainly, there's an argument that the web designer has to indemnify your friend (i.e. pay for any damages) for his own intentional actions -- like copyright infringement.\n(P.S. an image does not necessarily have to have a copyright imprint on it to be copyrighted.  This may raise the issue of ""innocent"" infringement, which may lower statutory damages, but probably will not change the analysis much in this instance, where there is a definite market for the images.)  \nSo, have your friend get a lawyer; and if he cannot get a lawyer by December 1, have him write back and say that he is in the process of getting an attorney who will get back to him by _____. Although attorneys often send demand letters with fast deadlines, they usually (read: USUALLY) do not take further legal action right away if they receive some response (because it's always cheaper to settle these issues than it is to file suit and litigate).\nIf your friend cannot afford an attorney, just make sure he keeps in contact with the other side. These sorts of disputes are rarely settled for the first demand.  (Your friend can consider a counteroffer based on the use of the image, or agree to pay a much smaller license fee and remove the image, for example.) Your friend also needs to forward this to the web designer to put him on notice that the web designer may be on the hook to indemnify for these damages.\nGet an attorney.",1550

1,"How can a spider, bug, ant etc. have a life behaviour of incredible complexity with such a small brain? ; For example, a spider can have a very complex behaviour similar to us, and even more spectacular: it hunts, build structures, have conflicts with other spiders, and even dance !\nA termite colony can live in complex societies, with over 10000 inhabitants. ; Invertebrates can manage this apparent degree of complexity because so much of their behaviour is instinctive. It is preprogrammed into their brains before hatching and is largely unchanging.  That method of storage is highly efficient because the macroscopic brain structure itself can be tailored to support it. This allows for very complex behaviours with relatively little brain mass. The downside is that the animals have little ability to learn and even less ability to respond to change.\n\nIn contrast mammals have very few preprogrammed behaviours, instead they learn most of what they need to know through experience. That makes mammals extremely flexible animals compared to most invertebrates because they can tailor all their behaviour to circumstances. The downside is that it requires a large brain to allow for all the possible circumstances the animal might meet.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider something like the ;structures’ that a spider builds. some species of spiders build complex silk baskets for their eggs. The basket consists of a ‘floor’ and a domed roof, complete with an escape hole for the hatchlings. They are very complex and very impressive without a doubt, but the spider makes them according to an inbuilt program. If that program is disrupted or indeed can not be initiated the spider simply can not cope. If a spider is disturbed just after it has constructed the floor of the basket it can’t simply start again. It has to complete the program cycle. It will spin the domed roof, then lay the eggs in there, and because there is no floor the eggs fall onto the ground an all die. \n\nCan you imagine a bird or squirrel that is disturbed hen it begins making its nest trying to build the sides of the nest on nothing? Nope, that’s because mammals and birds are flexible. The basic of nest building may be inbuilt, but the specifics are the result of learning and adaptations. \n\nAnd that is true of all invertebrate behaviour. An caterpillar will starve to death in a room full of food simply because the food doesn’t have any smell, or a spider that is prevented form spinning a web will starve even when given unlimited amounts of disabled but living insects because it can ONLY hunt when food is caught in a web. Bees will fight to the death to keep other insects out of their hive, but once they are inside the hive and acquire the right smell they will let other insects kill them and take no action at all.\n\nAnd the list of examples goes on and on. Bugs simply are not very adaptable creatures. If they experience something new they simply can not do anything about it at all. And although spiders, ants and so forth can learn their ability is extremely limited. They can exhibit complex behaviour in one limited way, but they can’t readily alter that behaviour. \n\nAnd that is why they can exhibit apparently complex behaviour with a small brain. The complexity is wired in, with no ‘waste’ space. But that comes at the expense of adaptability. In contrast mammals exhibit les complex behaviours but are infinitely more adaptable. Horses for courses.",1603

6,"What does someone who studied Medical Assisting do? ; Also...what's the salary range? What kind of jobs can the person apply to? ; Medical assistants perform routine administrative and clinical tasks to keep the offices and clinics of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors and optometrists running smoothly. \n\nThe duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on the location and size of the practice and the practitioner's specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually are ""generalists,"" handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area, under the supervision of department administrators.\n\nMedical assistants perform many administrative duties, including answering telephones, greeting patients, updating and filing patients' medical records, filling out insurance forms, handling correspondence, scheduling appointments, arranging for hospital admission and laboratory services, and handling billing and bookkeeping.\n\nClinical duties vary according to state law and include taking medical histories and recording vital signs, explaining treatment procedures to patients, preparing patients for examination, and assisting the physician during the examination. Medical assistants collect and prepare laboratory specimens or perform basic laboratory tests on the premises, dispose of contaminated supplies, and sterilize medical instruments. They instruct patients about medications and special diets, prepare and administer medications as directed by a physician, authorize drug refills as directed, telephone prescriptions to a pharmacy, draw blood, prepare patients for X- rays, take electrocardiograms, remove sutures, and change dressings.\n\nMedical assistants also may arrange examining-room instruments and equipment, purchase and maintain supplies and equipment, and keep waiting and examining rooms neat and clean.\n\nAssistants who specialize have additional duties. Podiatric medical assistants make castings of feet, expose and develop X-rays, and assist podiatrists in surgery. Ophthalmic medical assistants help ophthalmologists provide eye care. They conduct diagnostic tests, measure and record vision, and test eye muscle function. They also show patients how to insert, remove and care for contact lenses, and they apply eye dressings. Under the direction of the physician, ophthalmic medical assistants may administer eye medications. They also maintain optical and surgical instruments and may assist the ophthalmologist in surgery.\n\nThe earnings of medical assistants vary, depending on their experience, skill level and location. Median annual earnings of medical assistants were $23,940 in 2002. The middle 50 percent earned between $20,260 and $28,410. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $17,640, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $34,130. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of medical assistants in 2002 were as follows:\n\nGeneral medical and surgical hospitals: $24,460 \nOffices of physicians: $24,260 \nOutpatient care centers: $23,980 \nOther ambulatory healthcare services: $23,440 \nOffices of other health practitioners: $21,620",1623

Sacramento Dweller was correct in identifying this seemingly awkward grammatical structure as a matter of tense.  Sentences utilizing this particular structure generally fall under the category of ""Conditional Sentences.""  Sentences featuring the 'had had' syntax are classified as ""The Third Conditional,"" or ""Conditional Type Three,"" and can generally be diagnosed by analyzing them for similarities with following structural formulae:\n\n(The Type 3 Conditional / Third Conditional Formula:)\n\n"" IF + <insert past perfect tense verb> + <insert perfect conditional tense verb> = RESULT OF SUPPOSED CONDITIONS.*\n\n*~NOTE:  RESULT(S) of the supposed conditions usually resemble one of the following two structures, depending on when events occurred:  \n\n(1.) Result:  <insert simple present or past tense verb to express an obvious, or predictable fact / outcome>\n\n(2.) Result:  <insert modal verb  + simple present or past tense verb to express a known fact / outcome >\n\nEXAMPLE #1:  ""If you had had proper training as an assassin, we would not be in this situation...""\n\nEXAMPLE #2:  ""If I'd had proper training as an assassin, you probably wouldn't be here to complain.""\n\n(Notice how in EXAMPLE #2, the contractions 'I'd' is used instead of saying, 'I had had' to illustrate the terms of the condition being discussed, though still allowing the reader to ascertain and understand the time-frame and sequence in which events occcurred?)\n\nRules for proper usage of the ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure state that the structures are 'to be used when talking about unreal, or ""hypothetical"" situations occurring in the past.'  That means, the related events DID NOT 'ACTUALLY' HAPPEN in the past.  Sentences utilizing this structure are almost always phrased to reckon, ""If circumstances were different, what could / would have this been like?""  \n\nThe expression of time / tense in this [third] variety of conditional sentence structure IS identified as the past, and indicates that an action was completed ""in"" the past.  The condition and / or result, therefore, cannot logically be fulfilled because the action in the ""IF"" clause never actually happened.  Action in ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure is almost ALWAYS characterized by the quality of being absurd, and impossible to achieve.\n\nTense and Terminology?\n\n-Simple Present Tense:  Expresses a fact, habit/routine, or ability.\n\n-Simple Past:  Implies that the action happened before and is not happening anymore.\n\n-Past Perfect (Pluperfect) Tense:  Relates that an action or event ended prior to another action or event.\n\n-Present Perfect (Continuous) [Past-composite] Tense:  Indicates either events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Perfect (Conditional) Tense: Relates varying degrees of certianty or uncertainty about events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Modal Verbs:  incorporated with other verbs to illustrate the notion of possibility, impossability, necessity or other degree of probability.",1634

My friend recently said she was giving up listening to secular music not because she felt that the message was wrong but that she just loves music and listen's to it too much and memorizes the lyrics, she basically says she feels guilty for liking music...but why does she choose to single out secular...can you not memorize christians lyrics as well. I could completely understand if she felt that the music went against her religious beliefs but she listens to Tori Amos and Dave Matthews...last time I checked they weren't performing Ritual sacrafice on stage...I think she is being religiously trendy as i call it. ; HI Derek,\nGood question. Obviously I do not know what your friend's church background is. Although what she is doing is appropriate from a Biblical standpoint, she might be legalistic in her approach (Overly stiff, following a rule as though its the ONLY way to do something). But let's assume that she is a Christian that simply desires to walk with God in a close manner. There's a ""fancy"" word called sanctification. It means to be set apart. Both the Old Testament and the New are full of stories and commands that depict that God expects his people to NOT look like the non-believing people. So that alone could cause your friend to choose Christian music over secular. Have you listened to the words in secular music lately Derek? They've always talked about love, but they are now often filled with a lot of profanity, sex even violence. Christians are called to not purposely fill their minds with those things (Romans 12:1-2) because as a man thinks so he acts...(Proverbs 23:7) so if we fill our minds with negative thoughts, we tend to be very pessimistic. The same is true with any thoughts - garbage in - garbage out!\n\nWhen a person becomes a Christian they are set apart by Christ - He calls them to change, to leave what was behind and press ahead to what God has called them to do- He provides the power (Ephesians 5) but as a Christian we are under new ownership (2 Corinthians 5:17-21). If you are not a Christian, that may seem very odd, but it makes sense that if you have a new ""boss"" at work, you do things his way - especially if that boss is smart, loving and giving like God. Why wouldn't you want to follow him? \n\nAnyway, you asked, where in the Bible does it say....the problem in answering is: where does it not say that. I could quote passage after passage, but I think you see my point. \n\nFrankly, Christians SHOULD be involved as engineers, scientists, musicians, doctors and everything else. Christians are called to be salt and light to a world (Matthew %:13-14) which Jesus says is corrupted and is dying (He died to save people who recognize that and turn to Him). Perhaps your friend is overdoing it a bit - but perhaps this is her way of saying, enough is enough, and she's trying to run form her junky past and begin living more consistently for God. I hope you will be patient and supportive. \n\nHope that helps.\n\nMy best,\nProf Mark\nhttp://prof-mark.com",1637

Here is the author's own summary: \n\nA renowned Harvard symbologist is summoned to the Louvre Museum to examine a series of cryptic symbols relating to Da Vinci's artwork. In decrypting the code, he uncovers the key to one of the greatest mysteries of all time . . . and he becomes a hunted man.\n\nDuring the course of the novel it is alleged that the Catholic Church is perpetuating a major, centuries-long conspiracy to hide the ""truth"" about Jesus Christ from the public, and it or its agents are willing to stop at nothing, including murder, to do so.\n\nBefore reading the book, I would refer you to this literature that will give you a background of the basis of the book and the real historical fact.  http://www.crisismagazine.com/september2003/feature1.htm",1650

1,"How many people were there in the year 0? ; It takes two people to produce one person.Using this logic, one can make the assumption that right now, everyone reading this has 2 parents,4 grandparents,16 great grandparents, and 256 great great grandparents. There is an obvious pattern here: the number of people needed each generation to produce one person is doubled each generation. For the purposes of this question, lets assume that there are 4 generations each century. That would mean that every thousand years there are 40 generations, thus resulting in 80 generations in the year 0 (2000 years ago).Since every generation the number of people doubles, there must have been 2^80 people 2000 years ago.Inclusive of insane amounts of incest (grandfather-daughter, father-daughter, etc),this number is still too big. There is no way that there were 2^80 (approx1,208,925,820,000,000,000,000,000) people on Earth at that time. \nThe only explanation is that it takes less than two people to produce another person.Help?use math proof please ; Historical estimates say about 200 million.  \n\nSorry, can't help you with the math...\n\nhttp://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html\n\nPlus you're assuming a doubling of population every generation.

But I was on it before (for acne) and it made me really emotional so I got off and I felt better, but after I got off I didn't have my period for 7 months! I want to have babies in about 3 or 4 years, will going on the pill make that chance less? Also, is it better to just stay on or go on and off of the pill? My fiance is in the military so I don't see him that often but when we do well, you know what happens ^_~ Also, what are other side effects of the pill? do different ones do different things? I don't want to gain weight, be emotionally unstable or get acne. ; 1.) Yes, you can get pregnant after coming off the pill. For some women it takes a while for their cycle to return to normal. For some it only takes a few weeks or a month. Talk with your gynecologist to decide what pill will be best for you. \n2.) Remember when starting a new pill side effects can last anywhere from a week to three months so give it a fair go. It is better to just stay on it straight through versus going on and off. Going on and off can seriously whack your body/cycle and emotions out because your body will be constantly having a change in the hormones. And your periods would be all over the place.\n3.) Every pill will affect different people differently. That's why I say check with your doctor. I DON'T recommend the shot(Depo Provera) because some of the more common side effects are constant spotting and weight gain. Also it can take months or even a year after you go off it to have a regular cycle back. You may want to try a low-dose pill because of previous emotional side effects. Something like Ortho TriCyclen Lo or that new Nuvaring(you only have to remember that once a month!).\n\nGood luck.",1671

In these poorer countries, good, honest doctors are hard to come by, and even harder to afford. Many only want to save the lives of their dying loved ones. These people work long hours and do back-breaking work for a very inadequate salary. To get here, they have to pay large sums of money, and risk their lives. I know I wouldn't want to have to do that to enjoy the opportunities that I have. I don't understand why they can't be considered refugees.

That is completely absurd. \n\nFor the record, Mexico and Japan have the strictest immigration law. If you knew what the Mexican government did to persons whom they caught illegally entering their country you would totally rethink how the US treats immigrants. \n\nAlso, our government isn't saying these people can never come to the US to live or work, we just want them to respect the law.

0,"What's the light God created in Genesis 1:3?  Sun and Moon were created in Genesis 1:14-16? ; Genesis 1\n 1In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. \n 2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. \n 3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. \n 4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. \n 5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day....................................................... \n 14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: \n 15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. \n 16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. \n SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE??? ; It seems that the earth had been established in orbit around the sun and was a globe covered with water before the six “days,” or periods, of special creative works began. “There was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep.” (Genesis 1:2) At that early point, something—perhaps a mixture of water vapor, other gases, and volcanic dust—must have prevented sunlight from reaching the surface of the earth. The Bible describes the first creative period this way: “God proceeded to say, ‘Let there be light’; and gradually light came into existence,” or reached the surface of the earth.—Genesis 1:3,\n\nThe expression “gradually . . . came” accurately reflects a form of the Hebrew verb involved, denoting a progressive action that takes time to complete. Anyone who reads the Hebrew language can find this form some 40 times in Genesis chapter 1, and it is a key to understanding the chapter. What God began in the figurative evening of a creative period, or age, became progressively clear, or apparent, after the morning of that “day.” Also, what was started in one period did not have to be fully completed when the next period began. To illustrate, light gradually began to appear on the first “day,” yet it was not until the fourth creative period that the sun, moon, and stars could have been discerned.\n\nThe Bible does not specify the length of each of the creative periods. Yet all six of them have ended, it being said with respect to the sixth day (as in the case of each of the preceding five days): “And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a sixth day.” (Ge 1:31) However, this statement is not made regarding the seventh day, on which God proceeded to rest, indicating that it continued. (Ge 2:1-3) Also, more than 4,000 years after the seventh day, or God’s rest day, commenced, Paul indicated that it was still in progress. At Hebrews 4:1-11\n\nThe first day did not complete the “creation” of light with respect to the earth. The sources of it, of course, existed before that first day but were invisible from the surface of the earth. (Genesis 1:1) The first day saw only the penetration of diffused light to the surface of the earth, made possible by the thinning of obscuring layers that enveloped the earth like ‘swaddling bands.’ (Job 38:9) Illumination at the surface gradually increased with the thinning of the interfering layers.",1728

Seems to be one bad ass job but like most undergrads I'm still unsure. Anyways any information pertaining to the types of jobs out there either military or government would be greatly appreciated. Thanks ; Checking with your local politicians for a referral letter is pointless.  You must actually apply for the job and submit a resume via the agency's website; it is not a political appointment.  Your local politician is not involved in the hiring process.  Go to the CIA's website: https://www.cia.gov/careers/index.html and you can submit an application directly, if you are competitve then a recruiter will call you.  The same goes for the NSA, DEA, FBI, etc.  You can also put your resume on usajobs.com, a federal job database.  The Diplomatic Security website (through the State Dept) announces job openings and how to apply on their site. The last announcement for DS agents was about a month ago so there might not be openings for awhile but I think their website allows you to sign up for emails to alert you to new openings.  The application process for Diplomatic Security is tedious-online questionnaire, resume, and other forms.  They usually give you a week or so to submit all documents.  Each agency's website will tell you the proper procedures to apply and keep in mind that the application process is lengthy, especially when these kinds of jobs (i.e., federal agent) require a security clearance.  A background check can take several months to complete.  If you are graduating this spring you might want to consider applying now.",1759

Rather, they arbitrarily 'save themselves' through a false hope that all they need is 'faith'.\n But as I have observed time and again on this forum, their is little to no substance to the claims of salvation.\nIf one expects to receive the blessings of everlasting life, but disregards the effort of studying the word of god to find out what is acceptable to him, than, it is ludicrous to think that god will just somehow toss aside his own requirements to accommodate all the lazy people with their unrealistic expectations.\nThe simple truth? denominations are proof of deceitful men drawing men to follow themselves, thus putting a stumbling block in the path of weak minded persons to full of apathy as regards their own wish for eternal life.",1802

1,"what is meant by death ?how death occurs?what are all the changes takes place in the cellular level? ; i wan t to know about the biochemical changes occur in our body after death and of course about the parameters pH,and so on ; This is a more complex question than it seems. In order to fully define Death we would have to fully define Life, and that has not been done yet. Life can be described, and there is the Cell Theory of Life, but what 'life' is, no one can say yet.\nHowever, it is plain that everything living moves somehow, and that it reproduces somehow, and that whatever is living must use and excrete whatever substances it needs in order to keep on living. In most cases we are talking here about nutrition and respiration, respiration being the more critical. When respiration ceases either on a cellular level or throughout the entire organism, everything shuts down, because chemical reactions in the cells and between them can no longer take place. Some bacteria will go into a spore stage when this happens, and can thus survive extremes of temperatures and dehydration (like anthrax and TB). Generally in the absence of oxygen, cells lose their ph balance and become acidic, which upsets all chemical reactions in the cell. Conversely, anaerobic bacteria like botulism, when exposed to oxygen, go through a similar process of having all chemical reactions messed up.\nTherefore, although we cannot say what exactly 'death' is, we recognize it in animals by: an absence of respiration, an absence of pulse, an absence of reflexes (due to brain and nerve death), an absence of sensation, an absence of conciousness, and an inability to eat or reproduce. It is further noted by an absence of brain wave activity.\nIn plants death is noted by an inability to rehydrate, lack of response to stimuli, inability to reproduce or respire, and limpness.\nIn microbes, death is noted by an absence of cell division or reproduction, or by bursting of the cell walls.",1809

I literally place (not put.....but place--how anal is that??? lol) an ornament on a limb and then step back to see how it looks. If it's wrong...... well it's removed. I actually have my ornaments divided into ""tiers."" (You're dying laughing right now aren't you? I sense it.... I sooooo sense it.) I have those ornaments that go on the bottom of the tree......those that go in the middle... and those that are small and delicate and go on the small thin limbs at the top.

1,"Will the spin of galaxies ever stop? ; Do the laws of physics postulate that the spinning of galaxies/planets/moons will eventually slow to a stop or is it infinitely perpetual? (Bare with me. I have no physics education) ; carljoseph has the correct answer.  The galaxies have no reason to stop spinning any more than the planets have a reason to stop orbiting the sun.  (Eric p, I don't know why you think the law of perpetual motion does not apply to circular motion.)  There is no continuous force that *keeps* them in motion ... it's just momentum from the process that formed the  galaxies (or the solar systems), and there is no counter-force (like air resistance) slowing them down.  Now it's possible that there is infinitessimal resistance due to space dust, but there's nothing in the laws of physics that says that a rotating object (like a galaxy or a solar system) must eventually stop rotating.  So they will continue to turn indefinitely.\n\nNow, some of these stars will explode at some times in their lifespan, and may or may not leave behind the burned out shells (mostly iron, the most stable atomic nucleus there is) of dead stars and planets, but the galaxies will continue to spin as long as there are stars (or star remnants) in them.",1834

An entire wing (I believe it will be Cell Block D) will be devoted to manipulation and distortion of facts, including indepth analysis of the whole concept of ""truthiness"" (thank you, Stephen Colbert!). \n\nThe ""Dummies"" series you've alluded to in your question, planksheer, will include ""Presidenting for Dummies,"" ""Lying to Congress for Dummies,"" ""Obstructing Congress for Dummies,"" ""Lying to the American People for Dummies,"" ""Lying to the Entire Freaking World for Dummies,"" and of course the seminal ""Rummie for Dummies"" (a contribution from dubya's cellmate donald ""rummie"" rumsfeld, our nation's highest decorated nazi war criminal).\n\nI could go on about the wing (aka Cell Block C) devoted to picture books and featuring artistic exhibitions (including the commander-in-thief's own critically acclaimed -- ok, fox news acclaimed -- finger-painting collection) but that would spoil the fun. I guess we'll all just have to wait and see what other goodies are in store after the impeachments, war crimes tribunals and executions (yes, I'm afraid dr. evil cheney and piggy-man rove aren't going to quite make it to the big house, after all). \n\nAnd who ever said presidential library openings were dull? ;)",1860

There is no doubt whatsoever that the 1985 Bear would crush today's or the 2006 Bears.\n\nThe 1985 team was far more resourceful; it also had much better depth at each position. In 1985 one didn't ask, ""...if Grossman is on..."" because even if McMahon wasn't on one didn't wonder about the win--it was more of a question of by how much.\n\nPersonally, I believe that the 85' Chicago Bears were one of, if not the best football team of all time. They were also the team that started the ""Demolition Derby"" Super Bowl by just crushing the Pats, by the way, who was an excellent team.\n\nWhen push comes to shove, 85' had Big Mike Ditka who revolutionized the game by doing what it took to win all the way to the ""Fridge"".",1878

It is an oil war! The west wanted to control the middle east to control the OIL , manipulate the prices (the price of a barrel has tripled since the war with no clear reason) so it becomes difficult for China to get the energy they need to compete with US. \nThe British media and American media are nothing but a few millionaires who run the show.

1,"is oxygen flammable? ; will oxygen burn by itself without a fuel source? ; The answer is resoundingly NO.   Oxygen is NOT a fuel.  Flames, fire and all related chemical reactions are a result of a FUEL being OXIDIZED, or being combined with oxygen. The application of oxygen to a burning fuel will cause the fire to burn much more vigorously, as well as hotter.  \n\nOxygen, by itself, WILL NOT BURN.  If it did, our atmosphere (which is 20.9% oxygen) would have burned up a long time ago.\n\nOxygen is mixed with a number of different fuel sources to get a faster, hotter burn.  Acetylene, used in metal cutting torches, is mixed with oxygen to get a super hot flame that will quickly cut through metal.\n\nNASA uses oxygen to burn hydrogen fuel, not only to get a fast burn required in a rocket engine, but also because surrounding oxygen in the atmosphere becomes much more scarce as you leave the atmosphere for space.",1911

Be strong, and if you don't get satisfactory answers, then move on and find a guy who will appreciate you for yourself. You are worthy of better treatment than this guy seems capable of giving you.

That doesn't really make much sense, seeing how all creatures are in the process of turning into ""something else"" - we just don't know what the future of evolution holds.  Haven't you heard about the recent discovery of the fossil of the ""fish"" which helps to provide evidence of the transition of animals from water to land?  I don't really know what you mean by saying that there are no ""missing links"" - there are thousands of them!  I just ahve the feeling that no number of missing links would be sufficient.

My university is big on engineering, compsci, and premed, so I see lots of changes of major -- and polisci pops up quite often for people from all three schools. \n\nI personally was a Computer Engineering major, but ended up going ICS and Anthro after about a year and a half of boredom (considerably more EE stuff than I was expecting, and not enough programming).\n\nPhysics is also a popular transfer.

He spent his childhood in khawrazm.He was interested in Biological studying as gathering samples of plants and seeds for a Greek scientist.\n  \nHis studies\n\nHe began studies at a very early age under the famous astronomer and mathematician ''Abu Nasr Mansur''. Khwarazm was at this time,  the center of scientists and researchers. His contemporary well-known physician and scientist, Ibn Sina (Avicenna),  at this time lived in khawrazm. They met each other  to discuss about different biological subjects. Biruni left his native country at the age of 22 or 25 to the Khorasan, Rey, Tabarestan and Jurajan. He pursued knowledge in its various branches, and learned much of astronomy, mathematics, geography, physics and chemistry.For some years he lived in Jurjan. He wrote ''Athar al-Bqiah'' ,one of his great works, there. Biruni wrote it on the chronology of different nations and intelligently discusses the debatable theory of the rotation of the earth on its axis and accurately determines the longitudes and latitudes. The ruler of Jurjan ''Qabus Weshmgir'' offered him premiership but he refused.

Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

A black hole is a region of space from which nothing can escape, even light.  \n\nSince you can't see a black hole (that light that isn't escaping), one has to rely on indirect evidence.  \n\n If you've found a large mass concentrated in a small volume, and if the mass is dark, then it's a good guess that there's a black hole there.  \n\nIt'll be quite some time before we can get ""hard evidence"" of a black hole.

I was job hunting a few months ago, and I was constantly looking for resources to see how I can spark up my CV.\nSo I've got some links for you, but before that, a couple of tips:\n1. Avoid paid consultants. Wherever you go you come across people telling you how withput their help (which is very reasonably priced...NOT!) you won't be able to get a job because your CV will be binned streight away.\nDon't buy any of that nonesense. Read as many CV examples as you can, and very quickly you'll get a feel of what works for you.\n2. Do try to open the CV with a few bullet points about what you are and what you bring. Strong, assertive sentences will set the tone for everything that follow.\n3. Illustrate your skills through your experience: you didn't just *do* something, you utilized skills for that. So draw attention to that.\n4. Adapt your CV and cover letters for the positions you're applying to, and incorporate key words from the job posting. When people read that they go: OH! exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe Very best site:\nhttp://www.quintcareers.com/resres.html\n\nexamples of CVs:\nhttp://www.alec.co.uk/resume-examples/index.htm\n\nTips:\nhttp://www.misc-jobs.com/resumes_landing.php\n\nGood luck!",2117

3,"Has any found a half-decent online translator for European languages? ; Hey\n\nI don't use online translators on principle, especially for French and German because the grammar is always a little strange and you don't always get the correct meaning across I have found!!! (Lost in translation... literally). I studied sites such as\n\nhttp://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_services/worldlingo_translator.html\n\nand\n\nhttp://translation2.paralink.com/\n\nthough I am still trying to find one which gives generally accurate results. Any suggestions?\n\n(A good way to check the accuracy of a translator is to type a message, translate it to another language and translate it back to language).\n\nOn the contrary, does anyone knoe of any software on the market which is capable of accuratly translating European languages (preferably German/French though you can get alot of variation depending on which part of the world the langauge comes from)\n\nAlso on the contrary, does anyone have any amusing stories regarding online translators? (The can be a nightmare for businesses)\n\nRegards ; Generally speaking, I do not trust online translators at all. They are only useful to get a gist of what the original source text is saying. Currently, we do not have the technology to produce a target text that accurately conveys the meaning of the original text AND is grammatically correct in the target text. It's just not possible without human intervention. \n\nBy the way, the way you mentioned to check the accuracy of a translator is probably not the best method to use, because back translations are never accurate, even with a human. Back translations are never considered an accurate form of translation testing in the industry. It is difficult for even the best human translator to determine exactly what the original author meant to say through a translated phrase. A good translator is able to convey the meaning of a source text. A machine cannot determine meaning very easily.\n\nThe link below demonstrates SYSTRAN machine translations. At the end, it shows what happens when you translate the same phrase over and over again with different languages.",2132

5,"WHAT will Ivan Basso bring to the Discovery Channel Team? ; He has signed with them ; Awesome news!\n\n  I was unaware of this, so thanks for the good news.\nIvan is a great cyclist, with a great attitude and one of the best mountain climbers in the world (easily in the top 5).\nI think Basso is a much better fit with the Discovery Team then with his old CSC team. \n\nI'm also a big fan of Tyler Hamilton, who was suspended, due to doping (wrongly) accusations two years ago. Tyler has a very similar riding style, when compared with Ivan Basso.\n\nRemember all of the past TDFs where Lance Armstrong and Hamilton where always side by side on the mountain. stages? I don't know if Ivan would be able to endure the pain that Tyler did in the 2003 TDF, where at the end of stage 1, he was involved in a 35 rider accident where he broke his collar-bone in two places. He continued on to win the 17th stage and finish the Tour in 4th place overall.\n\nSo, as far as Discovery Team taking on Tyler's 28 year old, Ex-CSC teammate, Ivan Basso?  It should be an awesome move for everyone involved. \n\nI could easily see Ivan taking the Discovery team back to the Yellow, hopefully restoring the world's confidence in an American team once again.\n\nI can hardly wait!\n\nResponse to Ross:\n\n   By the way Ross, watch that stage again!  Ivan never beat Lance! That mountain stage win was a courtesy win given as a gift to Basso from Armstrong. Lance has a lot of respect for Basso and considered him to be a rider that could one day take his place. Watch the tour footage and you'll see Lance wave Basso on before reaching the finish. Lance gave up several yellow jerseys to other riders that he felt deserved it, as long as he had the overall lead, that was all that matterd to Lance.\n\nResponse to Doping Accusations by the (angry) Europeans:\n\nI myself, have never touched a drug in my life, yet years ago I tested positive twice, by the sport I was involved in. I retested again and was found innocent on both accounts.\n\nThan again when I was 17, I failed a polygraph that I was completely truthful on. I didn't get the job I was applying for, but I learned an important life lesson, not all test are fair and without fault.\n\nAs far as Floyd Landis, I can't be sure one way or the other. I hope that Landis is innocent, but that jury is still out for now.\n\nAs far as Tyler Hamilton, I without a doubt believe that he was wrongfully accused and hopefully he will soon be vindicated.\n\nEuropeans: Get over it!

Like the film's hero, Smith is afflicted with Morquio Syndrome, a rare enzyme disorder that affects the circulatory, muscular and skeletal systems. The Smiths were concerned about exploitation but after reading the novel on which the film was based agreed to allow their son to audition. Although he eventually lost on that role (the film was ""The Mighty"" and Kieran Culkin landed the part), Smith was recommended for another role in a film based on a novel. This time, his audition tape won over the director and the novice was hired to essay the title role of ""Simon Birch"" (1998), suggested by John Irving's ""A Prayer for Owen Meany"". Because of his illness, Smith is just over three feet tall, having undergone several operations including a spinal fusion and two bilateral osteotomies, he was the perfect choice to play Simon, touted as having been so small when he was born his mother didn't even notice the delivery.

2,"Ever heard of burning mouth syndrome? ; My mom has had problems with her mouth for over 15 years.She has visited so many doctors and specialists and no one knows whats wrong.Someone told us  she has burning mouth syndrome, which we think they made up.Her mouth hurts all day every day , her lips and gums are numb but are burning at the same time.It hurts her to talk even for 15 minutes. please if any one has heard of this ,let us know if there is a treatment or doctor she can be referred to? ; Yes Burning Mouth Syndrom does exist.  However, it's etiology (cause) is often difficult to localize.  It can be due to a number of different causes, some possibilities are: Anemia, Vitamin Deficiency, Fungal Infection, Neuropathy, Medicine induced and many other causes.  Unfortunately, about 60% of the cases are found to have no known cause (unknown etiology).  These cases are typically found in Older Women, often those who are feeling a bit depressed (often divorced or widowed, etc).  There is a belief that in these cases it has to do with the depressive state and there is actually no dental cause.  If all other causes can be rulled out, then antidepressants can be prescribed.  I'm not trying to say that this is what is causing this feeling in your mother, but I have to let you know that it is a possibility.  My suggestion is to have your mother referred to an Oral Pathologist to try to localize the cause.  Tell her to keep her mouth as moist as possibile (sometimes it is caused by a condition known as Xerostomia (pernounced Zero-Stomia) where the mouth is excessively dry).  They have a product called Miracle Mouthwash that has several components that aid in soothing irrative mouth conditions!  Hope that this proves helpful!",2275

The best advice I could give you is to pay the doctor a visit. Since you have never been with a person who has a herpes infection, I wouldn't be too worried about it.\n\nBut also know, that if a person has a cold sore, it is a herpes virus.

Only Web.\nThank you. ; 250 Bettina was discovered by Johann Palisa on September 3, 1885 in Vienna. It was named in honour of Baroness Bettina von Rothschild, the wife of the prominent Viennese banker Albert Salomon von Rothschild who had bought the nameing rights for £50\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild (October 29, 1844 - February 11, 1911) was a banker in Austria-Hungary and a member of the Rothschild banking family of Austria.\n\nBorn in Vienna, he was the youngest child of Anselm von Rothschild (1803-1874) and Charlotte von Rothschild (1807-1859). Known in the family as ""Salbert,"" he was educated in Vienna and Brünn\n\nOn his father's death in 1874, brothers Nathaniel and Ferdinand inherited most of the family's real estate and art collection. However, the family business went to Albert including the S M von Rothschild bank, the single largest shareholding in the Creditanstalt, and the shares in the Northern Railway. After two generations in Austria, communications between his family and the Rothschilds in England had diminished considerably but Albert wisely reinstated the regular exchange of vital information on current economic matters and politics in their respective countries.\n\nIn 1876, Albert von Rothschild married Baroness Bettina Caroline de Rothschild (1858-1892) of Paris, France, daughter of Alphonse James de Rothschild. They had the following children:\n\nGeorg Anselm Alphonse (March 22, 1877 - January 10, 1934), never married, he died in a private mental hospital and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \nAlfons Maier (1878-1942) \nCharlotte Esther (1879-1885) \nLudwig (Louis) Nathaniel (1882-1955) \nEugène Daniel (1884-1976) \nValentine Noémi (1886-1969) \nOskar Ruben (1888-1909), never married, at age 21 he committed suicide and was buried in the Zentralfriedhof, Vienna \n\nAlbert von Rothschild owed several large properties including the Palais Albert Rothschild at Prinz-Eugen-Straße 20-22, in the IV. district Wieden district of Vienna designed by the French architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur and built between 1876 and 1882.\n\nIn December of 1887 Albert and his wife were given the right to be presented at Court, the first time such a privilege had been granted in Austria to persons of the Jewish faith. Albert continued the family's involvement in the arts and with philanthropic projects. An avid chess player, he sponsored tournaments and in 1872 became president and patron of the Vienna chess society and took a special interest in institutions that provided assistance to Jewish artists and musicians. Following his wife's passing in 1892 at the young age of thirty-four, in her memory Albert von Rothschild built the Bettina Frauenspital (Bettina Hospital for Women) and a Bettina Rothschild begonia was named for her. A benefactor of the Vienna Observatory, the Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa named the large Main belt asteroid he discovered in 1885 the 250 Bettina in her honor.\n\nAlbert was awarded the Iron Cross of Merit in 1893 for his role in Austro-Hungarian monetary reform.\n\nWhen his unmarried and childless brother Nathaniel died in 1905, Albert inherited his Palais Rothschild at 14-16 Theresianumgasse in Vienna along with its large collection of art.\n\nAlbert Salomon von Rothschild died in Vienna in 1911 and was interred next to his wife and their six-year-old daughter Charlotte in the city's Zentralfriedhof. In recognition of Albert von Rothschild's years of financial support, the 719 Albert Amor asteroid was named in his memory by astronomer Johann Palisa.",2410

The United States continues to promote the strengthening of democratic institutions and human rights safeguards in Peru and the integration of Peru into the world economy. \nThe United States and Peru cooperate on efforts to interdict the flow of narcotics, particularly cocaine, to the United States.

As well as the appropriate wood for an arrow. ; Hard question to answer, bud.  A simple survival bow is easy enough but I have no idea how much work you want to put into it.\n\nEasiest way to learn?

Lots of really good woods out there and most everyone has their fav....me I just say cut a sapling.\n\nUse a semisharp knife and a hammer and split it right down the middle from the thin end.  Do that again so you have a 1/4 trunk.  That's called a bowstave.\n\nRound off the sharpness on that triangle shape in the exact middle, but keep the triangle shape.  Starting about a foot on either side of the center point, start whittling the triangle flatter and flatter as you move out to the ends.  Always whittle the back, not the front!\n\nKeep experimenting with bending it as you whittle....so if one end bends more than the other, simply whittle a bit more on the other end til it bends approx the same.  That's called ""tillering"".  I won't get into it.\n\nOnce both ends (the limbs) bend in a good solid arc and it feels good to you, carefully notch the ends so they can hold a string.\n\nTie your string on one end and then keep bending the bow and retying the other til the tight string is approx 8"" from the back of the bow.\n\nThat's a really basic survival type bow.  You could spend years mastering each step if you wanted to really make bows, but that one will have you shooting within an hour or two and they're fun to teach the kids as a summer project.\n\nArrows....you can use the same old 1/4 trunks that you cut for the bow.  Each one will make approx four arrows.  Simply split each 1/4 stave like before and just start whittling the corners.  Keep whittling the corners until they're round.\n\nAnything I need to cover in more depth?",2482

It is derived from Old English eorðe. Taking into account metathesis, we can find cognates of the word Earth in the Latin terra and in the modern Romance Languages (i.e. tierra in Spanish).\n\nAlthough a link to such Indo-European languages has not been proved, several Semitic languages have similar-sounding words for Earth: aard in Arabic, irtsitu in Assyrian, araa in Aramaic, erets in Phoenician (which appears in the Mesha Stele), and ארץ (arets, or erets when followed by a noun modifier) in Hebrew.""\n\nThe fact that Earth and not Water was used seems intuitive. The origins of the word Earth are very old, from a period when the known world was thought to be much less than it actually is, and [thought to be] primarily composed of land.",2517

If you have some graph paper you could find the points. The first number in each set is the x-number and the second is the y number. You are trying to find the distance between those points.

Connecting those two points makes the third side or hypotenuse of the triangle. \nSo we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance.\nSo its 3squared + 4 squared =9 + 16 = 25.We must take the square root of 25 for the final answer, which is 5.

Please look into this. You will be far better served in this instance if you take this route. Criminal law is not really any good until serious offences have occured in this area. Also, there is no such thing as a verbal assault in the eyes of the law. Although you could argue that someone suffers physically because of the verbal onslaught they had received, but this would be an exceptional case. \n\nSee a sol re civil law.

1,"Will we ever be able to go F.T.L.? ; i know there are a lot of doubts about this because the energy required would be close to infinite, and opening up a wormhole would also be next to impossible, even in the next 200 years of scientific advancement.  But, are there any scientific optimist out there who truly believes that we'll be able to achieve FTL in the next century or so, and why?  Give some minor facts to back up your claim. ; There is a big difference between predictions that the speed of sound could not be broken and that the speed of light cannot. It was always known that *some* things can go faster than sound. Bullets for example. The question was whether we would have the technology to get people to that speed.\n\nThe speed of light is very different since we haven't seen *anything* go faster than light in a vacuum. Nothing. Ever. Furthermore, the predictions of special relativity have been verified in particle accelerators when the particles are going to within a hundred thousandth of the speed of light.\n\nAs an example, at Fermilab protons are accelerated to energies of 2TeV. This is over 2000 times the rest mass of those protons. To accelerate something the mass of a *gram* to an equivalent speed would take about the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded. This amount of energy would be needed for each gram to get to that speed, so multiply it by 75000 for a medium sized human. And that doesn't count the spaceship they would have to travel in!\n\nNow, this is how much energy is needed to get to speed we *know* about. To go faster would require even more. Unfortunately, we have never seen a wormhole of any type. But the predictions are that the energy requirements would be even more prohibitive than what I just described.",2622

5,"What lures should I use in muddy water? ; I need answers now! I am leaving in 30 min to fish in a lake with muddy water due to 9 days of off and on rain.  What would be some more successful lures to catch some bass? ; When visibility is greatly reduced, choose big lures since they are easier for bass to see and catch. Bass seem reluctant to move far from a holding spot, so you want their first swipe at the lure to hook them. When the going gets muddy try: 1. Spinnerbaits – A large spinnerbait is highly visible and produces vibrations fish can sense with their lateral line. For maximum flash and vibration, use a 3/8 to 9/16 ounce black spinnerbait with a single Tennessee blade. If the current is slack, you may want to drop to a ¼ ounce model. You can also tip your spinnerbait with a trailer such as a big pork frog to add buoyancy so you can fish it slower. 2. Crankbaits – A big crankbait with a diving lip is deadly in muddy water, even in very shallow water. Use a slow retrieve to give the bass ample opportunity to find the lure. 3. Jigs – Use a big rubber-legged jig and large trailer to probe shallow cover. Black is a good primary color, but try a hot secondary color on the jig skirt or trailer, such as chartreuse or orange. In muddy water, you can approach bass closely, so try flippin a jig into cover in quiet pockets. 4. Plastic Lizards – Rig them Texas-style on a 3/16 ounce slip sinker. They work better than plastic worms because they have more bulk, therefore easier for bass to find. A lizard with a twister tail provides added vibration. Try black or black and chartreuse.\n\nIf spinnerbaits and crankbaits aren’t producing bass, slow your retrieve. If you still aren’t catching fish, change the lure style or size. Even lures of the same kind often produce different vibrations. A change in style and size changes the pattern of vibration, which can change the response of bass.",2626
1,"What is the easiest way to make an electromagnet? ; I am trying to build an electromagnet that can hold 200 to 500 lbs. ; Well, the easiest way is to get some wire, wrap it around a iron/steel rod, and apply a current to the wire.\n\nTo get an electromagnet to have a lifting capacity that you specified, it will require a little more engineering work.  Trying to stay in the most basic terms, the power of your magnet will depend on how much current you put through the wire, how many turns you have around the iron rod, and something called the magnetic permeability of the iron rod.  Now there's some trade-offs with all of these factors.  More turns increases the magnet flux (strength), but requires more wire and increases the resistance.  More resistance means that you will need more current to counteract this problem.  Treating your electromagnet strictly as a resistor (which it is not), by following Ohm's law, you increase the current by increasing the voltage.   Too much current and you may end up melting your wire.   You want to keep the wire as small as possible so that you can get the turns as close as possible to your iron rod, but smaller wire has a higher resistance and lower current carrying capability.\n\nIt's a matter of balancing a lot of equations to get the best combination.  Your best bet is a little trial and error.",2628

1,"Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ; Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ones? \n\na)They had more volcanic eruptions in the past, which released their internal heat. \nb)They were cooler when they formed. \nc)They have relatively fewer radioactive elements. \nd)The smaller ones are farther from the Sun. \ne)They have relatively more surface area compared to their volumes. ; Of your choices, (e) is the best.  (a) is no good because it fails to account for the continuing generation of heat, as, for example, by the earth.  (b) is no good because they were all about the same temperature when they formed.  As the protoplanets grew larger, their interiors began to heat up.  (c) is no good because what matters more is density, and there's no reason to believe there are significant differences in the density of radioactive elements.  (d) is just plain false: Earth is farther from the sun than Mercury.\n\nThat leaves (e).  Surface area of a sphere is 4pr^2, where p is pi, and volume is (4/3) pr^3, so the ratio of surface area to volume varies as 1/r ... it varies inversely with radius, so the ratio for smaller planets is greater than that for larger ones.\n\nThe key connection, though, is internal <pressure>, which is a direct function of r.

6,"Financial institution or not?  When to dump? ; I've been managing my money for quite some time and have done very well.  I realized that I may not be making wise choices with mutual funds and gave $80K to Fidelity to manage while I manage the rest of my accounts with Fidelity.  This was 4 months ago.  My rollover has since lost 10k.  Is it time to dump or is this the stock market?  None of my other investments have lost this much.  This is 10 grand in 4 months...   I'm ready to call them and say ""we're done, I'll do it"" but I'm not sure if they've changed my funds to give me a better turnover whereas I've left my money in my other funds for years.  Am I missing something? ; With respect to the market in general, there's been a good-sized pullback from May to the current period.  Those stocks which have suffered most are the ones which have had the largest amount of growth (precious metals, emerging markets, etc.).  Many funds not only lost all of their gains Jan-Apr, but many actually dipped into negative YTD territory.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: is this money you have in Fidelity on a permanent downward trend or an overdue correction?  Are your losses due to the possibility that your investments at Fidelity were focused on the highest growth (and therefore most volatile and overdue for correction) funds?  What are the long-term performance records of the funds you've chosen (4 months is a drop in the bucket of time)?\n\nBasically, you can't just look at gains and losses.  You have to look specifically at the funds you've chosen, and balance them against your personal risk tolerance.  It's very likely that with the right (or wrong) combination of funds, you could have lost as much with T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Bridgeway or any number of fund families.  If you don't believe me, look at their Websites and check the fund performances.  Red ink all over the place.\n\nDon't dump funds just because they're going down or buy them just because they're going up.  How do you know you're not buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  You'll inevitably wind up buying high and selling low.  Understand why you're buying into a fund and if the circumstances that made you buy them still make sense, stick with them.  If circumstances have changed, that's the time to re-evaluate and think about selling.  Also think about selling if the assumptions you made originally were wrong.",2688

I tend to spend more and more time with them, and become less interested in schoolwork. How do I keep myself motivated in school but still be able to be with my friends? ; I give myself a study quota every day. I have been working on my master's thesis right now and working full time and wanting to spend time with my family. I have promised myself that I work on it 2 hours per day, 6 days a week, and more only if I want to (like if I am getting a lot done). I have asked the people around me to support me in this. It has gone well. (In fact, I will finish it today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!--as you can tell, I'm a little bit happy about that. It has been a huge part of my life for months and months and months now)\n\nAnyhow- keep your daily quota and reward yourself. (when I was getting started, I wasn't very good at it, so I said that for every day I did it for the first two weeks, I could buy a song off of iTunes when I was done - then I went to a week - if I did it for the whole week, on Friday I could buy my favorite breakfast burrito on the way to work, etc.)\n\nGood luck!!! You can learn lots from your friends, don't underestimate that. But your diploma will make a big difference in employment opportunities, etc. Don't give up on that part of your education, too.",2692
2,"Are rowing machines considered cardio or resistance? ; I've been wondering this for awhile.  On one hand you're constantly moving and it's not THAT hard, like a cardio exercise, but on the other hand you push off with your legs & pull the handle with your arms (which puts off quite a bit of resistance!)  So is a rowing machine considered cardio, resistance, or a happy medium of both? ; Both!\nAny activity that challenges your muscles at loads greater than they are accustomed to via concentric and eccentric contraction is considered resistance exercise.  The duration of the movement and energy system being used then classifies the exercise as cardiovascular or otherwise.\n\nFor example if you were to row as quickly as possible for 10 seconds or less you would primarily use the phosphagen/creatine system which provides ATP immediately to the muscle, so the energy needs are fast and powerful.\n\nIf you were to then continue rowing for 20s to 90s you would involve the glycolytic system (glucose/lactic acid) and anaerobic contributions of to ATP delivery would increase.\n\nIt's not until about 2+ min that you require a much greater oxygen utilization which would kick-in the aerobic system hence a full cardiovascular workout.\n\nSo it really does depend on how long you decide to row.  Since most people row for extends periods, it's usually classified as a cardiovascular exercise although the argument to oppose it would have to fall under the above guidelines.",2694

1,"What is the difference between an incandescent and halogen light bulb.? ; ...it'sinteresting to me ; An incandescent bulb usually has a vacuum inside. Sometimes it has argon in it. While it is on, the tungsten in the filament is evaporating from the heat until finally the filament gets so thin that it breaks and the bulb is useless.\n\nA halogen bulb includes a halogen gas in it. While it is on, the tungsten in the filament is evaporating from the very high heat that these bulbs are operating at. However tungsten vapor evaporating from the filament combines with the halogen gas so that the filament is rebuilt when the tungsten lands on it and does not burn through. That lengthens the life of the bulb and the higher temperature also gives a brighter light for the same wattage. More light, more life, less operating cost.",2718

I was out on a pontoon boat on a local lake that I had fished for ages.  Loads of people go out there for a fireworks show at night, but being the avid fisherman I am, I took along a few rods and a couple tackle boxes.  \n\nWhile we were out there, a few of the people I was with started asking me questions about that particular lake.  One other kid who I knew didn't fish at all and didn't know diddly squat about fishing started answering everything.  He's your stereotypical frat boy and no offense to anyone out there, but he was fishing w/ a zebco 33.  Well after a while, I realized that he answered every question w/ ""Well the only real lure on this lake is a spinnerbait.  It's the only one that works anyways.""\n\nSo I waited until he said it a few more times, and then I said loud enough for everyone to hear me, ""You fish with that spinnerbait, and I'll use a plastic worm and we'll see what happens.""\n\nThis is where it gets good...\n\nFirst cast, I flipped a black trick worm about 3 feet behind an underwater tree that had reached the surface.  I pulled it a few times kinda jerkin' it, and in the next second, BAM!  I hooked up to a 4 pounder.  In about the next hour, I had landed about 25 pounds worth of bass in 5 fish.  \n\nI've fished plenty of tournaments, and I would have killed to have been in one that day, but as they say, ______ happens.\n\nMeanwhile, spinnerbait boy is over there in the corner w/ no bites at all.  By this time the people have tuned him out when he starts talking, and I'm loving it.  Then he casts and says he had a bite.  ""I missed it, I'll get him again.""\n\nThree or four more times, the bite is in the same place, and he keeps missing it.  (I'm starting to think it's a log, weeds, rock, etc. but I didn't say anything)  On the next cast, he got to the spot where he had been getting a ""bite"" and set the hook violently.  He fought and fought and fought and said he had a big one.  ""Get the camera, this one is going to be a good one""  <== Exact words.  \n\nWell when the monster surfaced, it was about a 4 ft. stick.  Everyone kept giving him crap about it and eventually he just sat back and shut up.  From that point on, every question from anyone on the boat was directed towards me!",2719

To do this you go to insert - blocks, then browse for the particular pre drawn block. \nTilemode to paper space is the command line way of jumping from the model tab to the layout tab at the bottom of the drawing area. You can do this by clicking the tabs at the bottom of the drawing like an excel worksheet.\nThe two mviews piece refer to creating viewports in the layout tab so you can see the model your have drawn...to do this make sure you are in the layout tab and click on View - Viewports - 2 viewports, two windows will now appear in the drawing with the same view of the table. \nAssuming the table was drawn correctly double click the area within the first view port and the click on View - 3d Views - Top, this will give you the plan view of the table, adjust the scale to suit. Then double click within the second viewport and the go to View - 3d Views - Isometric (there are 4 to chose from) this will give you your isometric view. Again adjust the scale to suit. Click outside both the view ports to return to the layout space\n\nI hope this helps, if you need any further assistance please feel free to email me.",2720

Don't know what 'fewer ulcer syndrome' is.  Generally, any condition labeled a 'syndrome' is a condition that has an unknown cause and is just recognized by its symptoms and signs.  Has your baby been tested for Celiac Disease?  This is a common condition (estimated at 1 person in 100) where the person is allergic to the protein part of wheat and certain other grains.  This protein is called gluten (also gliadin).  It is a common cause of mouth ulcers and unexplained mouth ulcers should be reason enough to test for it.  Ask your doctor about this.  If the doc doesn't know then ask for a referral to a specialist (gastroenterologist).  This can be a very serious disease because it can eventually cause serious damage to the intestinal tract.  So it should be taken seriously.\nGood luck.",2726

When I reboot PC, the boot up sequence will not complete. It keeps auto rebooting, shutting down, initialising then shutdown again by itself. I tried formatting the hard disk but then it cannot complete reading the whole recovery disk since while reading, it automatically shuts down and restarts without completing the whole boot-up sequence. I also tried reloading original configuration in the set-up mode but to no avail. No error would appear whatsoever, a clicking sound is heard to suggest that the computer has been powered-on then shutdown (no power) and then clicking sound to suggest it is again powering up. Sometimes if lucky enough, longer powering up even reaches to display the start-up screen but sometimes is too short that clicks on and off in short durations. This is like booting and rebooting done automatically by the computer. Is this a case of hardware problem and part has most probably been damaged? This is perfectly working before but not until now no new software/hardware was installed whatsoever. Please advise. ; There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors.",2780

You forgot to mention that not only are out schools overcrowded but they are also doing bi-lingual teaching which, if memory serves me correctly, is illegal in CA, and it hinders the learning process for the children who are english speaking only.  How do I know this?  Because my child went to a school where literally most of the teachers only taught in spanish and neglected the english only speaking students and my childs grades and learning abilities went into the toilet along with friends.  I quickly yanked my kid out of that particular school, went into another school district where  the non-english speaking children were taught in a different class for a certain amount of time during the school day so the other children were not distracted by the different language and they did not suffer in their studies.   Oh and let's not forget that it seems like all the stores now have all their signs posted in spanish first and english second, if we are lucky.\n\nOur country seems to do so much for the illegal aliens yet don't do jack crap for the citizens who were either born and raised here or who came to the country legally.\n\nLike I said, it is a sore subject with me so I guess it's time to get off my soapbox.\n\nps:  I highly doubt that California would be crippled economically if there were not illegal immigrant workers (illegal aliens).

History of stereotypes, (i.e. brought about by slavery, immigration, etc.....)\n   c. How are stereotypes formed.\n\nII. Impact of stereotyping in the workplace.\n    a.Racial/ethnic groups targeted by   stereotypes. (Here, discuss the impact of stereotyping, and institutional racism of African Americans, Latinos, and other ethnic groups that are growing in population in America.\n    b.Discuss diversity initiatives developed by employers to combat stereotypes.\n    c. Melting Pot vs. Salad Bowl. Here discuss that modern day sociologists no longer use the ""Melting Pot"" to describe America. We use the Salad Bowl. A ""Melting Pot"" was found not to appreciate individual differences. We are all put in a big pot and mixed all together. We are taught that we have to be the same. With the ""Salad Bowl,"" you have your lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, etc....

Go to www.dictionary.com to get all of your definitions okay?\n     b. Is tolerance fair? State that it is not. Tolerate means to put up with? Do we really want to ""put up"" those Mexicans, or those Pakistani people? No! We want to be appreciative and accepting of their culture, their contributions to the changing color of America. Get the point? \n\nIV. Summary/Questions:\n     a. Do a wrap up of your presentation, and give your audience time to ask questions: Also, have a list of books ready for reference.

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",2798

With the extra water, there is more pressure on the brain which sends mixed messages to it causing the emotional rollercoaster you're on.  She prescibed very mild water-tablets for me.

6,"someone help me? ; my teacher asked me that: how to put a elephant into a refrigerator, and after that how to put a lion into that same refrigerator\nIf someone know how, please help me\nThanks ; I smelled a rat when I heard this. Sounded like the teacher had a joke in mind, so here is the answer. It is very long. I have included a source so it is properly academic. \n------------------------------\nHow To Put An Elephant Into A Refrigerator\nAnalysis:\n1) Differentiate it and put into the refrig. Then integrate it in the refrig.\n2) Redefine the measure on the referigerator (or the elephant).\n3) Apply the Banach-Tarsky theorem.\n\nNumber theory:\n1) First factorize, second multiply.\n2) Use induction. You can always squeeze a bit more in.\n\nAlgebra:\n1) Step 1. Show that the parts of it can be put into the refrig. Step 2. Show that the refrig. is closed under the addition.\n2) Take the appropriate universal refrigerator and get a surjection from refrigerator to elephant.\n\nTopology:\n1) Have it swallow the refrig. and turn inside out.\n2) Make a refrig. with the Klein bottle.\n3) The elephant is homeomorphic to a smaller elephant.\n4) The elephant is compact, so it can be put into a finite collection of refrigerators. That's usually good enough.\n5) The property of being inside the referigerator is hereditary. So, take the elephant's mother, cremate it, and show that the ashes fit inside the refrigerator.\n6) For those who object to method 3 because it's cruel to animals. Put the elephant's BABY in the refrigerator.\n\nAlgebraic topology:\nReplace the interior of the refrigerator by its universal cover, R^3.\n\nLinear algebra:\n1) Put just its basis and span it in the refrig.\n2) Show that 1% of the elephant will fit inside the refrigerator. By linearity, x% will fit for any x.\n\nAffine geometry:\nThere is an affine transformation putting the elephant into the refrigerator.\n\nSet theory:\n1) It's very easy! refrigerator = { elephant } 2) The elephant and the interior of the refrigerator both have cardinality c.\n\nGeometry:\nDeclare the following:\nAxiom 1. An elephant can be put into a refrigerator.\n\nComplex analysis:\nPut the refrig. at the origin and the elephant outside the unit circle. Then get the image under the inversion.\n\nNumerical analysis:\n1) Put just its trunk and refer the rest to the error term.\n2) Work it out using the Pentium.\n\nStatistics:\n1) bright statistician. Put its tail as a sample and say ""Done.""\n2) dull statistician. Repeat the experiment pushing the elephant to the refrig.\n3) Our NEW study shows that you CAN'T put the elephant in the refrigerator.\n\nTo place a lion into the same refrigerator. Open the refrigerator door take out the elephant and put the lion in.",2806

8,"How do you forgive treachery and COMPLETE selfishness? ; I have 2 demons I'd like to forgive, but I don't know how. \nOne is my ex-bff whom I thought we would actually be bff, but she suddenly stopped talking to me and didn't give me a clue as to why. There was nothing I wouldn't do for her (within reason), and she did stuff for me, just not as much. She invited me to hang out with her and do stuff all the time, and she was a good best friend. I found out that she had been poisoning others against me behind my back, she was never fond of me to begin with, was annoyed when I called her my best friend, and she was using me. I'd like to forgive her, but I don't know how to forgive treachery.\n\nThe other demon is my dad's g/f. She is THE MOST SELFISH person I have EVER met! She expects things to be done all for her or her way, and never lets my dad or ANYBODY else have their say. She doesn't do anything for herself, her daddy does everything for her and lives across the street from her, she's VERY wasteful, and... ; I don't know if you're a religious person, but since your question is about forgiveness, I'll answer it from a Christian perspective; but please understand that you don't have to be religious in order to benefit from the wisdom of the Bible.  I do not consider myself to be Christian, but I still use many things I read in the Bible to help me through challenges of the spirit such as the one you have describe.\n\nFirst of all, we should ALWAYS forgive others.  Jesus said to forgive people seventy times seven times, which comes out to be 490 times.  If you have to forgive someone more times than that, they are probably so evil that it's not going to matter whether you forgive them or not; at that point your best best would bwe to just get the hell away from them!  LOL\n\nBut I think what he meant was to forgive as much as you possibly can.  But you sound very young to me- it sounds like there's not a whole lot you can do OTHER than forgive; sadly, we are basically powerless in our youth to change the behavior of others, so you'd better forgive wholeheartedly and do it RIGHT.  The following information is lengthy, but it will help you learn all you need to know about forgiveneness:\n\n- This is not an optional action on our part, but rather it is imperative to our own well being that we forgive others.\n- Most Christians understand that this is not always an easy task.\n- For some, there have been people in their lives which have wronged them severly.\n\n- Though it may be a process, and it may not happen instantaneously, we must be willing to take the first steps toward forgiving others.\n- As long as we continue to harbor bitterness in our hearts toward someone else, we allow that individual to have a controlling factor in our lives.\n- There are a number of occasions where unforgiving Christians lose their relationship with God because of what someone else had done to them in the church.\n\n- There was once a man who lost his relationship not only with God, but also his children and people in the church because of his bitterness toward others. He basically went around feeling sorry for himself all the time.\n- To forgive means to ""send away"". In other words, to not hang on to the wrong doing.\n\n- When you forgive someone, it means that you are not holding that sin against that person.\n- Therefore, you're not focused on how you can get back at that person.\n- You're not praying that their boat will sink or that their plane will crash.\n- As a matter of fact, you actually begin to pray for their salvation and deliverance.\n\n- Understand that when you forgive someone, it doesn't mean that you have to re-establish a relationship with that person.\n- It may, by God's will, lead to that and that's great if that's what God desires.\n- In the verse, there's no mention that you should stop praying and go find that person to let them know that you forgive them.\n- Release the thought of anger and bitterness and hurt unto God.\n\n- Forgiveness does not mean, by the way, to forget.\n- Trying to forget is merely an attempt to hide something.\n- When you hide something, someone will eventually find it.\n- We're are to deal with he hurt and send it away.\n\n- Jesus didn't just preach this. He lived this.\n\n(Luke 23:33-34 NKJV) And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots.\n\nFORGIVING OTHERS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND AND RECEIVE FORGIVENESS\n\n(Mat 6:14-15 NKJV) ""For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.""\n\n- It seems as if God's ability to forgive us is contingent upon our ability to forgi",2837

0,"What was the moral/lesson/purpose in the myth Jason and the Golden Fleece?!? It's urgent!I? ; I need specifics and please back up why or how it is the lesson/ moral... or give a good argument for the purpose!! ; The ram with golden fleece was a gift from Mercury to Nephele, to get her children away from their step-mother.  (Ancient child custody issues.)  The girl drowned, but the boy was ""hospitably received"" by Aetes, King of Colchis.  The boy then sacrificed the ram to Jupiter and gave the golden fleece to his host.  He placed it in a consecrated grove with a dragon to guard it.  Eventually, Jason's uncle, who was supposed to surrender the throne of his kingdom when he reached maturity, sent him on a wild goose chase, er golden fleece quest, claiming the fleece was the rightful property of their kingdom.  Which it was not.  Anyway, Jason rounded up a tough bunch of friends of his, and off they went looking for the fleece.\n\nFrom this point on, you can substitute what you know of grail quests, for the symbols and traditions have been intermingled for centuries.  One of the challenges Jason faces is a wily king with a beautiful sorceress for a daughter, named Medea.  Naturally, she becomes instrumental in his success.  Brave hero and beautiful witch.  Haven't we heard that one before a time or two?\n\nFrom here, I'll let you work out the secondary meanings.

3,"Can anyone summarize this in words I can understand? Self-Reliance By Ralph Waldo Emerson? ; There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried. Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact, makes much impression on him, and another none. This sculpture in the memory is not without preestablished harmony. The eye was placed where one ray should fall, that it might testify of that particular ray. We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. It may be safely trusted as proportionate and of good issues, so it be faithfully imparted, but God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace. It is a deliverance which does not deliver. In the attempt his genius deserts him; no muse befriends; no invention, no hope. \nTrust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers, and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort, and advancing on Chaos and the Dark. \nThese are the voices which we hear in solitude, but they grow faint and inaudible as we enter into the world. Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. \nWhoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world.\nA foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. ; One of the most profound truths of all time...I was so impressed by this essay 30 yrs. ago I copied it word for word...the essence in my opinion is found in his opening lines...""Every man is his own star""   Find the source of life and light within your own self.  Never be other than you truly are.  Speak the simple truth...which you cannot do until you make the hardest  journey...the one that goes to the depths of your soul.  This essay goes hand in hand with "" Know yourself "" and ""To thine own self be true."" Rely on your own instincts for self-preservation. Do no harm.  Never covet...expect only what is your own to come to you.  Live your own life...other people have opinions but no one else walks in your shoes.  Your life pathway is uniquely your own.  Integrity of mind is another way of saying wholeness and wellness.  The worst lie is the lie to your self.  The hardest work is to live without deception.  The past is only valuable for the lessons learned so don't get lost looking over your shoulder at where you have been.  Keep your eyes focused on where you are going.

If this occurrence is at the time of a Full Moon where the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow, it is called a lunar eclipse. The type and length of a lunar eclipse depends upon the Moon's location relative to its orbital node.

0,"how could Noah retain all 10 billion species and then distribute them appropriately ...? ; were all the marsupials are all in Australia and so forth.. ; Hello The agitator.. :)\n\nI pray you had a Blessed Thanksgiving Day.. :)\n\n \nCould Noah's Ark really hold all the animals that were supposed to be preserved from Flood?\n\nA growing number of scientists believe that geological evidence indicates our world has undergone a catastrophic flood. This is causing them to question whether or not the biblical account of Noah's ark could be true. Many people are rereading the Biblical description of the Ark to ascertain the feasibility of such a vessel to fulfill its designated purpose in light of present day knowledge of both zoology and our present day knowledge of shipbuilding.\n \nSize comparison between average size one-story home and Noah's Ark. Illustration from The World that Perished.How big was Noah's Ark?\n""And God said unto Noah… Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt though make in the ark, and thou shalt pitch it within and without with pitch. And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of… the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A window shalt thou make in the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side therof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it."" (Gen. 6:14-16)\n \nA cubit is the distance between an adult's elbow and tip of the finger, no less than 18-inches [45.72 centimeters]. (Scene from The World that Perished.)Most Hebrew scholars believe the cubit to have been no less than 18 inches long [45.72 centimeters]. This means that the ark would have been at least 450 feet long [137.16 meters], 75 feet wide [22.86 meters] and 45 feet high [13.716000000000001 meters]. Noah's Ark was said to have been the largest sea-going vessel ever built until the late nineteenth century when giant metal ships were first constructed. Its length to width ratio of six to one provided excellent stability on the high seas. In fact, modern shipbuilders say it would have been almost impossible to turn over. In every way, it was admirably suited for riding out the tremendous storms in the year of the flood.\n\nThese dimensions are especially interesting when compared to those given in the mythical, Babylonian account of the Ark. Here the ark is described as a perfect cube, extending 120 cubits in all directions and with nine decks. Such a vessel would spin slowly round and round in the water and from the standpoint of stability, would be a disaster.\n\nWas the ark big enough to hold the number of animals required?\nThe total available floor space on the ark would have been over 100,000 square feet, which would be more floor space than in 20 standard-sized basketball courts.\n \nAssuming an 18-inch cubit [45.72 centimeters], Noah's Ark would have had a cubic volume equal to 569 modern railroad stock cars.The total cubic volume would have been 1,518,000 cubic feet [462,686.4 cubic meters] --that would be equal to the capacity of 569 modern railroad stock cars.\n\nNow comes the question, how many land dwelling air breathing animals would have had to be taken aboard the ark to survive the flood?\n\nAccording to Ernest Mayr, America's leading taxonomist, there are over 1 million species of animals in the world.\n \nGod only provided the Ark for the protection of humans and land-dwelling, air-breathing creatures. A huge number of animals would not need to be taken aboard the Ark because they are water dwellers. Representatives would be expected to survive the catastrophe. With God's protection against extinction during the Deluge, survival would have been assured. (Scene from The World that Perished, a Christian motion picture about the Flood)However, the vast majority of these are capable of surviving in water and would not need to be brought aboard the ark. Noah need make no provision for the 21,000 species of fish or the 1,700 tunicates (marine chordates like sea squirts) found th",2925

Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs.

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

Would it absorb the planet, or wolud it stabalize itself in the core? ; A 100 kg black hole would be incredibly small. A black hole is an object that has a density so great its escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. For a 100 kg weight to be that dense it would have to have a radius smaller than 1.48*10^-25 meter. That´s smaller than a quark. If such an absurd object could form it would still be just a 100 kilo weight. It wouldn´t suck the earth in. Immediately... Earth still weighs more. It would simply fall towards earth but when it reaches the surface it would just keep on falling as it would be too small to hit anything. It would fall straight through the core and start falling upwards until gravity would make it settle there. Eventually though some matter in the core would come so close it would be captured by it. Remember that an object would have to move faster than the speed of light to escape a black hole. So the mass of the black hole would increase with time, feeding on earth. And as its mass grows it would capture matter in an increasingly greater rate. Eventually you would have a black hole with the mass of earth (+100 kg) orbiting the sun instead of the lush, blue planet we all know and love.",3003

Gaedel was supposed to be a ""Brownie.""  St. Louis Browns...get it?  Since he walked, he ended up with no at bats, and a batting average of .000.

3,"What is the meaning in the poem ""Psalm of Life?""? ; The peom is by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ; I find A Psalm of Life to be an extremely  powerful poem. There are many\nof us on this earth that do not understand that the soul is realy them\nand not their body. We are all a part of a larger creative intelligence.\nOur souls are what connects us to this divine, creative intelligence.\nEach of us comes with a purpose to fulfill and expand that creative\ninteligence on the physical plain. As children we are more connected to\nour sould purpose. However as we grow older we allow the ""inculturation""\nof our society to move us away form our souls purpose and more toward\nour physical self. Yet our ony purpose is to create a world that is so\npure that that soul can manifest itself without the illusion of our\nphysical form.  The soul never dies.\n\nWe must all remember tis truth -\n    ""Dust thou art, to dust returnest,\n     Was not spoken of the soul.""\n\n\nWhen he writes that the soul is dead that slumbers, he means that if your soul is dormant or asleep it may as well be dead because you're not using it,\nWhen great men leave footprints in the sands of time, he means that they leave footprints in the sand that stand the test of time, they are remembered - they make a difference!\nCattle are the conformists - they do not think for themselves, society thinks for them, and they are all the same.\n\nThis is a very inspirational poem. The concept of living only in the present is a very difficult thing for me, as the regrets of the past and hopes of the future can be very troublesome and misleading at times. This brings out feelings of...almost like confidence. Strength and belief in oneself. The thought he expresses in this, one how to live through each day, is one I firmly sympathize with and believe in.\nThe meaning of this is very clear. Just live. Don't be hindered by the fear of oncoming, certain death, or whatever mistakes you may've made before, live by the second and only plan ahead that far. The is no concrete point in life, nothing is sure and steady, so don't live like it is going to be that way.\nThis has a very punctual, powerful rhythm. It works great for this, as the theme and message of it is a very strong, very passionate one. The wording, flow, everything in this goes perfectly hand in hand. I don't think it could've been written any better.\nThis is an excellent write, one I'm also going to save. I find it to be very uplifting, very inspirational.",3035

They have the potential to affect the jet streams and general pressure patterns around the globe. Ocean currents still remain in many areas despite daily flouctuating changes in surface air conditions.\n\nIn order to find the answer to this you have to see where sea currents are the most weak and where air currents are present.

Rolling Stone magazine reported in December 2005 that Keys and her longtime songwriting partner Kerry ""Krucial"" Brothers will start working seriously on Keys' third studio album in the latter half of 2006. There are also rumors that she worked with Linda Perry.  Keys has explained that her new upcoming album has a more edgy feel than her first two albums  and she is keen to do strange and unexpected collaborations outside the R&B and hip-hop worlds.   Keys plans to collobarate with John Mayer, John Legend, and Linda Perry on her third studio album.  \n\nKeys recently opened a new recording studio in New York, which she co-owns with her co-production and co-songwriting partner Kerry ""Krucial"" Brothers.  Keys and Kerry Brothers are co-founders of KrucialKeys Enterprises, a production and songwriting team who assisted Keys in creating her award-winning albums as well as create music for other artists.\n\n \nAlicia Keys in Smokin' AcesKeys has finished shooting a film alongside Ben Affleck, Ray Liotta, Andy Garcia, Jeremy Piven, and Ryan Reynolds entitled Smokin' Aces, scheduled to be released on January 26, 2007, in which she plays an assassin named Georgia Sykes.

This kid is already on record as the youngest QB ever to win a Superbowl, he's got his whole life and career in front of him, and he doesn't care to protect all that he has to live for?\n\nOne article I read mentions how players past and present, as well as his coach have appealed to him to reconsider his celebration of freedom in not having to wear a helmet. Fellow Americans presumably equally in support of ""freedom"" yet were also able to consider what he potentially had to lose if he should meet in an accident.\n\nAnd here we are. The article I read said ""injuries do not appear life-threatening."" Will he play again? Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye. He refuses to wear facial protection, and he's out for the first month. Duh.\n\nLike everyone else in the sports world, I join in wishing Big Ben a full recovery. I hope we get to see him continue what many are now confident must be a hall of fame career. Do I feel sorry for him? Sure...but, for crying out loud, at what point do we hold people accountable for taking unnecessary risks? Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street? If we expect kids to make smarter decisions in the interest of their own safety, why is it so easy to make excuses for ""adults""?",3085

It will spell it out for you.\n\nI don't think you can say that you are addicted to food, and that you have no emotional problems in the same sentence.  If you want to lose weight, exercise and diet are the keys.  There's no quick fix.  If you keep eating like you are, you will keep gaining, pure and simple.\n\nIf you want to lose wight: Instead of 3 meals a day, eat 6 SMALL meals. Drop your carb and fat intake, as it is obviously too high. Cut out ALL sweets... no more deserts. Treat fast food like the plague that it is... in other words, don't do it! Drink LOTS of water, drink NO sodas. Up your activity level and get on an exercise program 5 days a week. You may not want to exercise now, but after a week of it you will find it addictive and you will have no trouble maintaining it. \n\nYou either need to change your entire life style, or forget it.

They should point you in the right direction regarding financing options. Because your parents ""make too much money"" as is the case with the majority of college students, you will probably need to take out student loans. If you go through the U.S. Department of Education's Direct Loan program, the interest rates are extremely reasonable and payback schedules are flexible. \n\nBesides loans, you can also attain non-need-based grants, and scholarships through private institutions. Then, there are also work study programs. Although, admittedly, many of my friends did not like this option. \n\nPlease heed the deadlines for applications submissions as they are extremely important. Be open with your financial aid officers and let them know your concerns and they should give you some good advice.\n\nGood luck!",3103

Anyone know anything about that or can give me some links on that or on other developing technologies for alternative sources of energy away from gasoline and natural gas? ; The ground temperature several feet beneath your home is fairly constant at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take a few degrees. Circulating water or some other liquid through this region and returning it to your house, delivers to you a source to heat or cool your home to 60 degrees, even if the outside temperature is -10 degrees, or +120 degrees. Now you have solved most of your heating/cooling problems, and all you need is to let the outside air raise the inside temperature from 60 to 74 degrees in the summer, and install a simple secondary heating system (enough to only raise the temperature about 14 degrees) in the winter.

This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard. This is a very expensive use of money indeed!\n\nIn the UK, currently, a significant amount of personal debt is financed at high-ish interest rates.

6,"adsense revenue? ; why am I only getting 0.95 for 5 clicks on (insurance keyword) on my google adsense account? I thought that insurance keywords were worth alot, like 3-15 dollars a click? ; Top keywords list that say a keyword costs anywhere from 3-15 dollars is one thing; and the real income received from the publisher is another thing. Google Adsense has what is called ""smart pricing"" which either discounts or jack up the cost to an advertiser depending on how likely a web page will convert for the advertiser. What you are experiencing is a classic case of smart pricing. You've been smartpriced out of what you thought was a high keyword\n\nFrom the Google webpage, here is how they define smart pricing http://www.google.com/adwords/learningcenter/text/18989.html\n\n""Because contextually targeted ads on our content network sometimes return lower conversion numbers than ads on Google.com search results pages, clicks from the content network use ""smart pricing"" adjustments. Google's smart pricing technology automatically lowers the cost of content clicks based on the referring site, to maximize the return on investment for advertisers. \n\nIf our data shows that clicks from a particular content page are less likely to return results, our system automatically reduces the price the advertiser pays for those clicks. The AdWords system takes the work out of CPC bidding, helping to ensure strong return on investment no matter where your ads appear. Smart pricing adjustments are automatically reflected in the average CPC for content targeting shown in the Campaign Management interface. \n\nAs an example of smart pricing, consider two websites, each related to digital photography. The first page features digital camera reviews, while the second offers photography tips. Clicks from the page of photography tips might be charged less, because they are expected to convert into sales less frequently, resulting in lower value for advertisers. Google data determines that clicks from the digital camera reviews convert better, so clicks from this page are not discounted.""",3162

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

4,"What is object oriented programming? ; I dont know a lot about computer, but I heard my friend talk about object oriented programming.\nWhat is object oriented programming?\nWhat are its major elements?\nIs it an important concept in programming? Why so? ; If you've never used an object-oriented language before, you need to understand the underlying concepts before beginning to write code. You need to know what an object is, what a class is, how objects and classes are related, and how objects communicate by using messages.\n\nObject-oriented programming. Objects of the program interact by sending messages to each other.\n\nWhat Is an Object? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An object is a software bundle of related variables and methods. Software objects are often used to model real-world objects you find in everyday life. \n\nWhat Is a Message? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    Software objects interact and communicate with each other using messages. \n\nWhat Is a Class? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class is a blueprint or prototype that defines the variables and the methods common to all objects of a certain kind. \n\nWhat Is Inheritance? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    A class inherits state and behavior from its superclass. Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring software programs. \n\nWhat Is an Interface? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    An interface is a contract in the form of a collection of method and constant declarations. When a class implements an interface, it promises to implement all of the methods declared in that interface. \n\nHow Do These Concepts Translate into Code? (in the Learning the Java Language trail)\n\n    This section looks at a small applet, and shows you the code that creates objects, implements classes, sends messages, establishes a superclass, and implements an interface.\n\nfor the importance part\n\nObject-oriented programming is claimed to give more flexibility, easing changes to programs, and is widely popular in large-scale software engineering. Furthermore, proponents of OOP claim that OOP is easier to learn for those new to computer programming than previous approaches, and that the OOP approach is often simpler to develop and to maintain, lending itself to more direct analysis, coding, and understanding of complex situations and procedures than other programming methods. Translation from real-world phenomena/objects (and conversely) is eased because there is direct mapping from the real-world to the object-oriented program (generally a many-to-one). The converse mapping, from the object-oriented program back to the real-world, is by way of a one-to-many mapping, where each 'many' is seen to be a collection of well-defined subsets (or superset), which together compose a real-world object. The corresponding object defined in the program may be seen as representing some proper subset of the real-world object's features.",3183

(e.g. rent, salaries, capital equipment...)\n\nVariable cost are expenses that change in proportion to business activity.(e.g. raw materials,....)\n\nYou certainly wouldn't want your rent to go up if your business had a good month, or your salary to go down if you had a bad month.

A disadvantage I remember them discussing was that you have a harder time forming study groups and such while you're in class, because a lot of younger students aren't that responsible, although by med school I bet a lot of that's eliminated.\n\nGood luck, you're going to stress over tests, practicals, and clinicals, but don't stress too much, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Oscar has the one key weapon to beat the tuck and roll style that all the Mayweathers used, the same weapon Julio Cesar Chavez used to dismantle Floyd's Uncle Roger, the left hook.\n\n      When Julio fought Roger, who Floyd fights exactly like it was the left hook that landed and hurt Roger and allowed Julio to go upstairs on Roger. Gilberto Reyes came up with the plan to attack Rogers body at all cost, no matter what Roger threw Julio was to stay on the body and keep throwing his left hook to Rogers liver for the first 5 rounds nothing but BODY, BODY, BODY. Any fighter who tries to stand there and exchange and unload bombs on Floyd's head will lose. He's way too slick for that. The body attack is key here.\n\n   Oscar is a converted Southpaw meaning when he was a little kid his father switched his left handed stance around and made him fight as a right handed fighter all Oscars power is in his left hook. Oscar knows the value of a great body shot, a perfect example would be his fight with Hopkins. Floyd Sr. knows that this is key to beating his son and jumped on the Bandwagon for a estimated 3 million dollars, so he can look like the brain trust and Architect who came up with the plan to beat Floyd when Oscar had the tools all along.\n\n     Thank you for the great question Loverly Lady Vette.",3231

I want to lose 10 lbs very quickly, what else do I need to do? ; You need to have high intensity and increase sessions to 1.5 hours here is a plan I follow. \n\nIf you want to do this it is for life so you need to totally change your way of eating and exercising. This is not a diet rather than a healthy eating plan for life. So no more talking diet cause it means time limit.  \n\nHere are the golden rules: \nInitially cut down to 1200 calories. \nExercise 6 times per week for 1 hours a day. Do three weight sessions and three cardio sessions. No gym involved. \nDon't eat carbs after 4pm, never eat carbs within 2 hours of exercise or within 1 hour of exercise. \nDrink 3 litres of water per day. You can have a green tea at the end of the day. \nLimit your fruit in take to 2 pieces per day. \nNever eat dinner after 6pm.\nAdopt of low GI eating plan this is sustainable for life!\nMake low fat dairy choices \n\nFollow this menu plan as a suggestion: \nBreakfast 7am - 1 cup hot water w lemon\n20 minutes later have a bowel of oats w water (no honey) OR\nfruit salad w low GI soy yogurt\nSnack 10am - pear or apple (both low GI)\nLunch 12.30pm - multigrain sandwich w 50g tuna & salad (no butter)\nSnack 3pm - low GI yogurt OR skim berry smoothie (no honey or banana) plenty of ice, 1/2 cup skim milk & 1/4 cup yogurt\nDinner 5.30pm - 120g grilled lean meat/fish/prawns/tofu patties (not fried) w spinach salad & mixed vegies (no whites, carbs) OR 3 egg white/soy omlette with ham, cheese and tomato\nSnack - 1 scoop of low cal low fat ice cream (if hungry)\n\nExercise is must be intense. Refer to www.bodybuilding.com for your weights routine. Never do weights two consecutive days have a cardio day in between. \n\nCardio needs to include running, go hard up stair wells and cycling. You get the most benefits from exercise when your body is totally fatigued and this is when you see changes. \n\nTo maintain you can increase calories to 1500 and reduce exercise sessions to 3-4 times per week. If weight creeps up again due to holiday period etc.. go back to 1200 cal and 6 sessions again. \n\nGood luck it worked for me it can work for anyone.",3254
1,"PHYSICS PROBLEM.. can you answer it? ; Bob and Joe, 2 construction workers on the roof of a building, are about to raise up a keg of nails from the ground by means of a rope passing over a pulley 16 m above the ground. Bob has a mass of 100 kg, Joe 80 kg, the keg 40 kg, and the nails 80 kg. Bob and Joe slip off the roof and the following unfortunate sequence of events takes place. \n\nBob and Joe, hanging on the rope together, strike the ground just as the keg hits the pulley. Unnerved by the fall, Bob lets go of the rope, thus the falling keg pulls Joe back up to the roof where he cracks his head against the pulley but gamely hangs on. However, the bottom falls out of the keg of nails when it strikes the ground. The empty keg rises to the top as Joe returns to the ground. Finally, Joe has had enough and lets go of the rope as he remains on the ground, only to be hit by the empty keg. \n\nIgnoring the possible mid-air collisions, how long did it take for this drama to unfold? use -10 for acc. of gravity. ; Hope this helps...\nBreak this question down into four independent events.  1) Bob and Joe falling, 2) Keg with nails falling, 3) Joe falling, 4) Keg falling.\n\nIf you look at one specific event, then you can assume that both sides of the pulley start at rest (since either it starts that way, or some poor guy smacks the ground or the pulley).  Therefore: look for Fnet on the total masses on the rope.  Take for instance, the first episode, where Bob and Joe (Total mass 180kg) is against the keg and nails (120kg).  Since F=ma, then the individual forces on Bob and Joe = 180(10) and the keg and nails 120(10).  So, Fnet would be 180(10)-120(10) for this specific case.  Then, you would look at the total Force, the total mass, and the acceleration of the entire system.  Once you have the acceleration, then you can easily figure out time, since you have a 16m pulley height (you have to assume Bob and Joe are starting at pulley height, otherwise the problem is unsolvable).  Just use the -1/2at^2+Vot+do=D equation, and since there is no Vo, this should be easy.\n\nDo this for each subsequent episode with the varying masses, and that should give you your total time.  Oh, and the rope has to be massless and the pulley frictionless, too.\n\nAnd unless I'm totally missing something, just plug and chug.  Good luck!",3255

But has it worked or does it really have any jurisdiction over its members, no.  Many nations, such as the United States of America, have failed to ratify much of the UN charter.  For example, the US has not ratified the International Criminal Court, a separate judiciary entity somewhat affiliated with the UN.  However, the UN does play a somewhat integral part in maintaining communication with outside nations. A great example is the UN's efforts to aid with peacekeeping in Darfur.  Though this is seemingly unsuccessful, the UN has worked to maintatin the prescence of peacekeeping troops in the region. \n\nHowever, this leads to more problems.  Throughout the years, peacekeeping troops have been known to rape their refugees and commit other inappropriate acts during their mission. This increases the negative opinion of the UN and its actions among nations.  In addition, when nations such as the US blatantly violate the charter and the UN declarations, it suggests the ignorance of global opinion. These events lead to greater tension between nations instead of increased pacifism, as the body is designed for. \n\nNo nation, due to the act of sovereignty, must abide by the laws of the UN.  This is solely because if the rules of the UN were more heavily imposed than national law, prominent UN nations, the UK, US, France, etc., would have greater precedence in the domestic politics of smaller nations, such as Swaziland.  This would lead to an almost imperialistic setting where global superpowers would be able to enact laws that colonized developing nations and poverished nations.\n\nI hope this answers your question!",3340

I've gone thru Refferance Books and all but what's all about them but mainly how they happen and what's about its characteristics and procedures. ; A compressor or supercharger pressurizes the intake air in an engine. This fits more air into the cylinder, enabling it to burn more fuel. So you get more power from a given size engine. In piston-engine airplane, it lets the plane fly higher, where the atmosphere would otherwise be too thin.\n\nA turbocharger is the same thing, but it uses a turbine that is powered by engine exhaust to run the compressor.",3352

This will ease up on some of the pain. \nApply heat to your abdomen with a heating pad or hot water bottle, or take a warm bath. Heat improves blood flow and may decrease pelvic pain. \nLie down and elevate your legs by putting a pillow under your knees. \nLie on your side and bring your knees up to your chest.

1,"Why there is redshift & violetshift if planets move close or away?If wavelength changes then why? ; I understand that the redshift and violetshift is due to change in wave-length. What is my doubt is that why there is change in wavelength. Is it like wave is compressed or stretched? Is is like that, that wave has to accomodate it self between earth and corresponding planet? ; good question....its kind of complicated but basically, one type of Red Shift is similar to the doppler effect for sound. When an ambulance screams towards you the siren gets noticable higher pitched, then when it races away the pitch drops. This is because the sound waves are traveling at a fixed speed  toward your ears, but the fast movement of the ambulance is changing the frequency, or the rate at which those waves hit you. it is essentially smushing more of the sound waves together as it approaches you and stretching them out as it moves away. This same principle applies to light and all electromagnetic waves. \n\nThe other type of red shift include cosmological redshit, and gravitational or (relativistic red shift). \n\nCosmological red shift can occur as space it self expands, this expansion of space expands the actual photons and inturn drops the frequency of the light towards red. \n\nGravitational Red Shift can occur when ever light passed through a gravitational field. Gravity imposses a time dilation effect on anyting in the field and so photons are also subject to this. The result is the drop in frequency towards red. \n\n(it is also important to note that the red shift also applies to all electro magnetic waves visible or not, and in cases where the light would be infra red or already at a lower frequency than red, a red shift would actually shift that wave further away from red.)",3363

On top of that, the learning process never stops as new languages may be required, which leads you to invest lots of money for crash courses in weird languages to learn the basics as quick as you can.\nAntoher chance you may try is working in hotels or teaching foreign languages...although the income will be pretty low.",3512

If it’s so good at cleaning, does it clean my inner body when I eat it? Or does it hurt my body?\nHow is it made? Is it a plant? Is it a mineral? ; anyways here are some ""non-scientific"" unpasted explanation of what vinegar is.\n\nVinegar-is basically spoiled alcohool (thats why you can have things like rice vinegar, white wine viengar, and simple clear vinegar). It happens when alcohol from your favorite wine (just say its that wine you have in your cabinet that you opened) what happens is that the alcohol in your wind gets oxidized by the air and turns into vinegar, which is actually acetic acid with around 5 percent concentration.\n\nB.\nWell veingar is a known acid. the thing is that its a very weak acid, so in fact it should do nothing to your body (the reason why it cleans well is because deposits are bases. from chemistry. acid+base = salt.)\n\nC. it should not hurt your body (you do have body grade ""sulfuric acid"" in your stomach)\n\nD.\nhow to make it? just leave out some wine or something with alcohol and you have homemade vinegar!\n\nE.\nNot a plant\n\nF.\nNot a mineral\n\nHope that helped.",3521

For a station in Earth orbit something higher than 9 km/s seems reasonable, less for lower inclination orbits.\n\nOnce you've got that you then need the exhaust velocity of your rocket, it would depend on what you are using but you can get some rough values from the first source.\n\nWith that the mass ratio is the exhaust velocity times the natural log (ln key on scientific calculators) of the Δv.\n\nThe mass ratio is the difference between the starting and ending mass of the rocket so the amount of fuel will be the (mass ratio minus one) times the mass of the rocket structure + payload.\n\nYou'll probably get something absurdly large (it's very hard to exceed 10 in the real world) and if so then you've got to use staging which makes it a lot more complicated.\n\nThe Soyuz FG which launches the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft to the ISS has about 280 tonnes of propellant at launch over all three stages for a spacecraft lighter than 8 tonnes.

1,"How come when it rains, some times there's thunder and lightening with the rain and sometimes there's not? ; And how come sometimes there's wind with the rain and some times there's not? ; Lightning is one of the oldest observed natural phenomena on earth. At the same time, it also is one of the least understood. While lightning is simply a gigantic spark of static electricity (the same kind of electricity that sometimes shocks you when you touch a doorknob), scientists do not have a complete grasp on how it works, or how it interacts with solar flares impacting the upper atmosphere or the earth's electromagnetic field.\nLightning has been seen in volcanic eruptions, extremely intense forest fires, surface nuclear detonations, heavy snowstorms, and in large hurricanes. However, it is most often seen in thunderstorms.At any given moment, there can be as many as 2,000 thunderstorms occurring across the globe. This translates to more than 14.5 MILLION storms each year. NASA satellite research indicated these storms produce lightning flashes about 40 times a second worldwide.This is a change from the commonly accepted value of 100 flashes per second which was an estimate from 1925. Whether it is 40, 100, or somewhere in between, we live on an electrified planet.\n\nThe Sound of Thunder\nRegardless of whether lightning is positive or negative, thunder is produced the same way. Thunder is the acoustic shock wave resulting from the extreme heat generated by a lightning flash. Lightning can be as hot as 54,000°F (30,000°C), a temperature that is five times the surface of the sun! When lightning occurs, it heats the air surrounding its channel to that same incredible temperature in a fraction of a second.\n\nLike all gases, when air molecules are heated, they expand. The faster they are heated, the faster their rate of expansion. But when air is heated to 54,000°F in a fraction of a second, a phenomenon known as ""explosive expansion"" occurs. This is where air expands so rapidly that it compresses the air in front of it, forming a shock wave similar to a sonic boom. Exploding fireworks produce a similar result.\n\nWhat is the difference between a thundershower and a thunderstorm?  \nTechnically, there is none. In general, the term ""thundershower"" tends to denote a fairly weak storm with light to moderate rainfall and low levels of lightning activity. However, there are no defined parameters that distinguish between a thundershower and a thunderstorm. In fact, in order to avoid confusion, we in the National Weather Service do not use the term ""thundershower"". If a shower is strong enough to produce lightning, even just one single bolt, it's called a thunderstorm.\n\nTo Learn More about Lightning and Thunder go to \nhttp://www.srh.weather.gov/jetstream/lightning/lightning_intro.htm\n\nLIGHTNING SAFETY A MUST READ\nLightning is the MOST UNDERRATED weather hazard. On average, only floods kill more people. Lightning makes every single thunderstorm a potential killer, whether the storm produces one single bolt or ten thousand bolts.\n\nIn the United States, lightning routinely kills more people each year than tornadoes and hurricanes COMBINED. Tornadoes, hail, and wind gusts get the most attention, but only lightning can strike outside the storm itself. Lightning is the first thunderstorm hazard to arrive and the last to leave.\n\nLightning is one of the most capricious and unpredictable characteristics of a thunderstorm. Because of this, no one can guarantee an individual or group absolute protection from lightning. However, knowing and following proven lightning safety guidelines can greatly reduce the risk of injury or death. Remember, YOU are ultimately responsible for your personal safety, and should take appropriate action when threatened by lightning.\n\nWhile no place is 100% safe from lightning, some places are much safer than others.\nWhere to Go Where NOT to Go \nThe safest location during a thunderstorm is inside a large enclosed structure with plumbing and electrical wiring. These include shopping centers, schools, office buildings, and private residences.\n\nIf lightning st",3565

When I was younger I wore a hellish back brace for 2 1/2 years 24/7. In my case the curvature progressed. Two years ago I had scoliosis surgery. I was 18 and had an ""S"" curve (56 thorasic & 68 lumbar). Dr. Munish Gupta at UC Davis in California was my surgeon. He did a WONDERFUL job! 12 vertebrae were fused and 3 (only looks like 2) titanium rods were put in to straighten my back. It worked! I was so scared of having surgery. Scared of what could go wrong. My fears did have merit as things can go wrong, but if I could go back and do it all again, I would! I now wish I had had surgery sooner. I even LOVE the scar down my back (and the small one from the bone graft on my hip) and gained about an inch in height.\nAnother testament to the fact that the surgery was a success is that fact that as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I do not accept blood transfusions. With a surgery this big one tends to loose blood, but because my surgeon agreed to use bloodless surgery equipment it was no problem! Everything went perfectly. I have also been in two major car accidents since my surgery and nothing broke or was damaged. I also actively ride horses, swim, and do everything I did before the surgery (ok, I do MORE now!). I have even been told I can go bungee jumping and on roller coasters if I want! hehe\n\nFeel free to contact me if you ever want to talk about surgery or anything.

5,"Difference between soft ground and firm ground cleats? ; I'm in need of new soccer cleats and have become curious about this question. ; Soft ground boots come with replacable studs (usually 6 per boot).  These studs can be metal or plastic and screw into the bottom of the boot sole.\n\nFirm ground boots come with the studs already molded (usually 13) on the sole of the boot.  They can be small studs or in case of the newer boots nowadays, blades.\n\nUnless you are playing at an elite level, where you are playing on very good grass pitches that are properly maintained and watered, it is probably a waste of time buying '6 studs'.  Best to stick with the molded boots.\n\nKeep in mind too that if you play in a climate where rain is quite frequent (UK, etc.) it might be better to buy the 6 studs as you will be playing the majority of your games in those conditions.\n\nBest solution, if you can afford it, is buy a pair of each.\n\n:)",3676

I already tried unistalling and re-installing WMP. Also, when I try to play Sims 2 I can't hear the background sounds. HELP! Please! ; Step 1: Checking volume and mute settings:\n\nThe volume setting for one or more sound devices might be disabled or set too low. Use the following steps to adjust volumes to their correct levels:\n\nIn Windows XP, click Start, and then click Control Panel.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel \nIn Windows XP, open Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices, and then click Sound and Audio Devices.\nIn Windows 98 and ME, open Sounds and Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab. \nIn Windows XP, click the Advanced button under Device Volume.\nIn Windows 98 and Me, click the Volume button under Sound Playback. \nRemove all checkmarks from Mute boxes at the bottom of the Master Volume window and adjust the volume setting slide bars to their highest positions. Close the Master Volume window and test for sound. If there is still no sound, go to the next Step. \n\nStep 2: Verifying the connections:\n\nUse the following steps to verify that the sound cables are properly connected from the speaker to the computer (cable connectors and plug assignments are normally color-coded to aid with connections).\n\nUnplug the sound cable. \nPlug headphones or one speaker directly into the speaker out connector on the back of the computer. The speaker out connector may have a symbol of a speaker \nor a circle with an arrow pointing out, or it may just say ""OUT"" next to it. Test for sound using the computer. If sound does not work, go to ""Step 3: \n\nIf sound is restored when the headphones or one speaker is plugged in, replace the original sound cable with a new sound cable and test for sound. Sound should be restored after replacing the sound cable. If sound does not come back after replacing the cable, the sound card needs to be replaced because the speaker out connector is bad.\n\nStep 3: Configuring on-board sound in the BIOS:\n\nSome computers come with sound on the motherboard (on-board), and some computers use a sound card. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS has to be set according to your particular sound configuration. Perform the following steps to correctly configure the sound in the BIOS:\n\nLook at the back of your computer and use one of the following three items to determine the proper sound configuration and sound setting: \nIf the plugs for the speakers and microphones are located next to the parallel, serial, or USB ports, then the computer has on-board sound. The on-board sound setting in the BIOS should be Enabled. If the plugs for the speakers and microphone are located away from the other ports and sit in an area by themselves, the computer has a soundcard. The on-board sound setting (if there is one) in the BIOS should be Disabled. If the computer has sound plugs in both locations, a \nsoundcard has been added to the computer that already contains on-board sound. The on-board sound setting should be Disabled. To enter the BIOS, turn on the computer and when the first screen appears, press the F1 key repeatedly until the BIOS Setup screen opens. Use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to select the Advanced tab. Press the DOWN ARROW key to select Onboard Audio Options and press ENTER. If Onboard Audio Options is not available, select I/O Device Configuration and press ENTER. If Audio Codec is listed, select it and press ENTER. Select either Enabled or Disabled depending on your \nconfiguration and press ENTER. Press the F10 key and then press ENTER to save and exit Start Windows and check for sound. If there is still no sound, continue to the next Step.\n\nStep 4: Restoring the sound drivers\n\nUse the recovery process to restore individual drivers for a sound or combination sound-modem card. \n\nIf the computer came with recovery discs (Windows 98 and Me), place the last disc of the set into the top disc drive and follow the on-screen menus as they appear. Restart the computer after restoring the sound driver software and test for sound.\nIf there is still no sound, continue to ",3694

8,"weed any one know bout it? ; how long does the affects of pot usualey last after u smoke it.. ; Q: How long does marijuana stay in the user's body?\nA: THC in marijuana is rapidly absorbed by fatty tissues in various organs. Generally, traces (metabolites) of THC can be detected by standard urine testing methods several days after a smoking session. However, in chronic heavy users, traces can sometimes be detected for weeks after they have stopped using marijuana.\n\nQ: What happens if you smoke marijuana?\nA: The way the drug affects each person depends on many factors, including:\n- user's previous experience with the drug; \nhow strong the marijuana is (how much THC it has); \n- what the user expects to happen; \n- where the drug is used; \n- how it is taken; and \n- whether the user is drinking alcohol or using other drugs. \nSome people feel nothing at all when they smoke marijuana. Others may feel relaxed or high. Sometimes marijuana makes users feel thirsty and very hungry—an effect called ""the munchies.""\nSome users can undergo bad effects from marijuana. They may suffer sudden feelings of anxiety and have paranoid thoughts. This is more likely to happen when a more potent variety of marijuana is used.\n\nQ: What are the short-term effects of marijuana use?\nA: The short-term effects of marijuana include: \n- problems with memory and learning (11);\n- distorted perception (sights, sounds, time, touch) (6); \n- trouble with thinking and problemsolving (5); \n- loss of motor coordination; and \n- increased heart rate. \nThese effects are even greater when other drugs are mixed with the marijuana; and users do not always know what drugs are given to them.",3702

Japanese college is easy compared to American, and many Japanese students try hard to be allowed into an American college because, when an employer is looking for a job candidate, a Japanese man that's been to America (thus proving he must know English very well) looks better than one who went to Japan (and knows everything that everyone else in Japan knows).",3738

The scrubber removes other gases such as CO2, H2S, Nitrogen and water vapor.  They often use absorption or other techniques to remove the unwanted scavanger gases.  All gas that is transported, must be treated to pipeline grade.  That is it must be treated to meet certain standards of purity--moisture content, btu, hazardous gases, etc.  Scrubbers are designed based on the gas analysis for a particular gas field.  For example, gas generated at a wastewater treatment plant will require the removal of CO2 and H2O.  Other gas fields may require the removal of other impurities.",3778

The outer segments of the photoreceptors are responsible for catching photons of light, which initiates an electochemical signal that ultimately results in vision.  There are two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in lower light levels, while cones are responsible for color and most form recognition.  Rods are dispersed throughout the retina, while cones are most densely packed in the region of the retina responsible for your central, or ""straight ahead,"" vision.  This area is called the macula.  In fact, the center of the macula, the fovea, contains only cones, and they are very densely packed in this area to allow for higher resolution of fine detail.",3785
6,"characteristics of earnings management from good, no consequence to bad.? ; when and how earnings management constitute financial fraud ; The CPA Journal article “Abusive Earnings Management and Early Warning Signs,” by Lorraine Magrath and Leonard G. Weld (August 2002), distinguished between earnings management activities that are simply good business practices and abusive earnings management intended to deceive the financial community. Good business practices include the following activities:\n\nCareful timing of capital gains and losses; \nUse of conferencing technology to reduce travel costs; and \nPostponement of repair and maintenance activities when faced with unexpected cash flow declines. \n\nOn the other hand, abusive earnings management results from actions such as those cited in the SEC section 704 Report:\n\nImproper revenue recognition; \nImproper expense recognition; and \nUsing reserves to inflate earnings in years with falling revenues. \n\nMagrath and Weld identified six relationships that investors and auditors should consider as early warning signs of abusive earnings management:\n\nCash flows that are not correlated with earnings; \nReceivables that are not correlated with revenues; \nAllowances for uncollectible accounts that are not correlated with receivables; \nReserves that are not correlated with balance sheet items; \nAcquisitions with no apparent business purpose; and \nEarnings that consistently and precisely meet analysts’ expectations",3786

Memorization won't help you in the long run.\n\nThe point of having law students read cases (and the point that often gets overlooked) is that the value is in learning how to digest and understand the material. Briefing the case let you practice how to quickly go through a case, and pull out the important statements of law. That's the same thing you are going to have to do as an attorney, when researching appropriate legal precedent.\n\nYes, the facts of the case also help form an association to assist us in remembering the rule. Anyone who has taken Remedies will probably remember the egg-washing-machine case. \n\nBut the point of the learning process is to understand the general concepts and to learn how synthesize simple rule statements from complex holdings. The other part is to be able to understand why certain fact patterns trigger the application of certain rules.\n\nMost law schools just assume that students will figure out why they are reading cases as they go along. But if you understand the purpose of the reading, and take advantage of the reading to actually practice the relevant skills, you can be more effective in your studies and your practice.\n\nIf you are asking how to do good in your exams, then practice is also the key. The goal is to Learn to recognize fact patters and understand what rules should apply. For learning the rules, see above. For writing the essay, remember your IRAC. Don't skip the analysis portion. Be thorough, and write simply. \n\nWhen in doubt, do practice exams from past classes. Most professors are willing to read your practice exams and give you feedback. Practice is the key.",3795

9,"could i be gay..? ; im pretty sure im not gay but everytime i look at naked men i get aroused, i heard that this is normal and it happens to most guys. ; How to tell if you're gay: \n1. If you are over 30 and you have a washboard stomach, you are gay. It means you haven't sucked back enough beer with the boys and rather you've been sucking-off the boys and have spent the rest of your free time doing sit-ups, aerobics, and doing the Oprah diet. \n\n\n\n2. If you have a cat, you are a Flaaaayming gay. A cat is like a dog, but gay: it grooms itself constantly but never scratches itself, has a delicate touch except when it uses its nails, and whines to be fed. And just think about how you call a dog...""Killer, come here! I said get your butt over here!"" Now think about how you call a cat... ""Bun-bun, come to daddy, snookums!"" Jeeezus, you're fit to be framed, you're so gay. \n\n\n\n3. If you suck on lolipops, Ring-Pops, baby-pacifiers, or any such nonsense, rest assured, you are a Gaylord. A straight man only sucks bar-b-q ribs, crab-claws, raw oysters, craw-fish guts, pickled pigs feet, or titties. Anything else and you are in training to suck El Dicko and undeniably gay. \n\n\n\n4. If you refuse to take a dump in a public bathroom or piss in a parking lot, you're in a deep homosexual relationship. A man's world is his bathroom, he defecates and urinates where he pleases.\n\n\n5. If you drink decaf coffee with skim milk, you like a high hard one in the poop-chute. Coffe is to be had strong, black (or with thick, wholesome milk) and full-aroma. A vagina-eating man will never be heard ordering a ""Decaf Cafe Latte with Skim"" and he will never, ever know what artificial sweetner tastes like. If you've had Nutrasweet in your mouth, you've had a dick there too. \n\n\n\n6. If you know more than six names of colors or four different types of dessert, you might as well be handing out free passes to your bung. A real man doesn't have memory space in his brain to remember all of that crap as well as all the names of all the players in the Major league, NFL, NBA, college ball, PGA, and Nascar.

I want to truthfully answer your question even though you have attempted to set traps. You see age is not the issue you’re attempting to make it. In some countries the life expectancy of a man is under 45 years of age and in many places in the Bible we find that men in other areas have lived in excess 500 years. Certainly life and coupling practices are different under both circumstances. So while age and culture vary the truth you seek is at what age is a given woman old enough to make life impacting decisions on her own. We see that many cultural differences answer that differently how ever being a man who loved too early and now has daughters prone to make the same bad choices, I have found truth in the area of your interest and it is this. First a child must grow enough to read and write and think deep thoughts a child should then contemplate the great depths a life could travel and the results a life could feel because of choices made. A child should realize that there is a higher power and a help in the living of that life. That child should seek first that powerful assistant and His support. Seeking that first could not possibly cause you to miss the match that would have been known to you as the perfect match. However seeking Him first guarantees that when the time is right He will bring to you the one that is meant for you. A woman should wait until God makes the match so that she doesn’t ruin the perfect union with baggage left over from youthful mistakes and indiscretions based only on the physical urges children. You know in some countries adulthood is not recognized until a person reaches their 30’s Perfection does not play worldly games and does not make sence to mankind.

I've had a bruised tail bone (which most people get their first day out), a dislocated shoulder, a mild concusion, and a broken hand.  I did all of this on different jumps.  Basically learn to jump on a small jump and increase your speed and the size of the jumps you're hitting as you get more comfortable.\n\nWhen you start snowboarding be mentally prepared for a challenge.  It usually takes at least a full day to catch on (and often times a few days).  You want to practice staying on the edge of your board and turning to stop.  Once you can go a short distance and stop, practice edging down on your toe side and then transfering your weight to your heals (making you turn the other direction slightly) and edging on your heals.  Going back and forth smoothly from heal to toe and back is called carving.  That's the first thing you want to learn to do when you start snowboarding.\n\nGood Luck!!!",3846

Things are constantly breaking down, and being fixed, which is why the symptoms vary, and even dissappear from time to time. \nThe observation that lipitor coincided with relief may just be coincidence.\nThere is no obvious pathophysiologic explanation as to why an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (like lipitor) would reduce symptoms of MS.",3903

Herod was ruler over Israel at the time of Jesus birth.  When the Magi (aka wise men) came looking for Him Herod freaked out and when he learned that the prophecies foretold that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem he sent his soldiers to the Bethlehem area and had them slaughter every male child under the age of two.  Herod was old at that time and he died not long after.\n\nPontius Pilate the Roman Procurator ruled from to 26 to 36 AD.  Which covers the active ministries of both John the Baptist and Jesus the Messiah.\nPontius Pilate had more authority than those Governors who had preceded him.  He had absolute authority judicially.  It is he who presided over Jesus ""trial.""\n\nHope that clarifies things for you a bit.\n\nTry reading the first four books of the New Testament.

I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922
9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace. Even though the outside world has bestowed upon the boys a sense of morality and order, the danger of savagery remains real even within the context of that seemingly civilized society that has nurtured them.",3923

I have some ideas of my own and before i implement the same, i wanted to have some of my  inquisitives cleared. Hence this post. The electricity generated in small amounts to large amounts have to be stored for later usage. is this possible? if so, how and how long can the stored electricity be made available for usage. once this is answered i have further questions related to this topic and those knowledgeable may kindly help answering the same; for the betterment of our society / humankind. Thanks and Regards - JON ; You can store it in batteries and it lasts as long as the batteries last.\n\nThe sun produces a huge amount of energy every day (173 millions of billions Watts). The amount we receive generates wind (converted into electricity through windmills), heat, photosynthesis of plants and trees and 1.37kw of energy per square metre. This energy can be harnessed by PV cells and converted into electricity. In fact, less than 1% of our planet’s desert areas would generate all the electricity we need if it was covered with PV panels.\nGenerating electricity this way is quite simple: light hits a cell made of a thin layer of silicium over a metal support which generates electrons. The motion of these electrons generates current. PV cells are assembled in panels, generating up to 100w/h of DC power (14v approximately). These panels are connected to a regulator, which controls the electricity production, sends some to appliances, some to battery storage and dumps any excess. PV panels generate electricity when subjected to sunlight. This means they do not produce at night. This is why most systems store electricity in batteries.\n \nHOUSING APPLICATIONS\nA modern house does not require a lot of electricity and it does not seem very efficient to burn diminishing fossil resources in huge plants located far away and then transport this electricity over hundreds of kilometers to houses. By having a few PV panels on the roof, any ordinary house can generate its electrical needs; this power can be supplied in DC (for halogen lighting for example) and AC (220V) through an inverter to power standard appliances.\n \nA house connected to the grid can then sell electricity by day and buy some back at night.\nAn independent house generates all its needs by storing electricity in battery banks. In windy areas, a windmill can be a very good complement to PV systems.\n \nPV systems do not require fuel, have no moving parts that can wear, require virtually no maintenance and last for a very long time (some PV systems have a 30 years warranty).\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\nThey constitute the bulk of the applications today, for remote lighting, transmitters, satellites in space, etc. Industrial buildings could also produce part of their needs through PV.\n \nCOST MATTERS\nIs PV technology expensive? Prices are now going down and make it ever more competitive. PV systems last a very long time and over say 50 years, they should become extremely competitive.\nThe cost of fossil fuels is expected to increase over the next 20 years. Furthermore, fossil fuel generators require heavy maintenance. Another aspect to take in account is the pollution they generate: this has a heavy cost in terms of global warming, poor air quality, health problems and logistic costs (transport of fossil fuels, electricity on high power lines and their waste), not to mention collateral damage such as oil slicks, Chernobyl type accidents, respiratory diseases, chemical runoffs and other nasty results.",3969

1,"Why is it bad to put metalic objects in the microwave? ; what usually happens when you do? ; The previous answers explain what metals DO in the microwave, but not WHY.  \n\nIt is not necessarily bad that metal is in the microwave: the walls of the microwave are made of metal!  What is so special about metal?\n\nThe reason that metals are shiny is that they have free electrons in them.  The free electrons in metal are what make the metal electrically and thermally conductive; ceramics don't have free-electrons and so are not shiny- metallic in appearance (you can tell just by looking).\n\nIt turns out that the free electrons in the metal reflect photons (energy packets) of light for both visible and thermal (microwave) ranges.  Long electromagnetic waves (microwaves) also behave as photons; we don't call them photons of light because we can't see them, but microwave photons are in fact the same kind of photon, just of lower energy.  It is important to understand that all that is going on in the microwave is that the metal in the microwave is reflecting the microwaves (and not being absorbed).\n\nThe way that microwave heat is by coupling electromagentically to 'wiggle' atoms (certain atoms/molecules anyway; those that have a dipole moment) very fast, causing heating (not metals of course - the microwaves bounce off; and not materials without a dipole moment, which is why some ceramics and glasses don't heat up).  Water isn't even the most efficient coupling material at microwave frequencies; this is why sugar heats up so much faster. \n\nThe microwaves are reflected by the metal walls until they are absorbed, (usually by water-containing food), their energy being converted to heat. Should absorption not take place - if, for example, the oven is activated when empty, some energy will re-enter the waveguide and cause over-heating of the magnetron. Usually a safety switch turns the machine off when this happens. Note that the reflecting walls and the constant frequency of the microwaves set up standing waves in the chamber. This results in some areas being much more active than others and is the reason why food must be rotated through the varying field to cook evenly.  \n\nSo why does a metallic fork arc?  The resonance induces enough movement in the electrons in the metal to create an electric field charge sufficient to arc (even though it is a reflecting material, electrical currents are induced).  Note that the metal object won't arc if it is grounded to the walls, and it won't arc if it is insulated sufficiently (I have a metal 'roast rack' in my microwave).\n\nGenerally it is not a good idea to put metals in the microwave because you want the food to absorb the energy, the manufacturer of the microwave spent a lot of time designing the standing wave energy field to be uniform to do just that, and introducing metal distorts that field - its OK if you know what you're doing, not so good if you don't have a purpose in mind.",3976

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

All that matters is that you are right for each other for however long it lasts.  If you get along, then to heck with what your friends say or how loud they laugh.  if they are really your friends, they'll accept it and have compassion and understanding and not mock you or put you down.  To joke when you gals are alone, well jokes, alone, that's okay.  But to gossip or hurt your feelings, their not friends and never really were.\nGo with your heart and forget what others will say.

9,"Can anyone tell me the address...? ; to reach the Dixie Chicks by? This is a serious question, so please don't post whether or not you support them about their comments on Bush. All I need is the address. Thank you! ; Hello,\n\nI was not able to find an actual address, but I did find their website where you can sign up for their mailing list and I did find this information as well:\n\nThe Dixie Chicks have very recently changed management.  I do not yet have a new address for fan mail.  Once one is available, I will post it here immediately.\n\n \n\nBoth the old Nashville P.O. box address for ""Senior Management"" and the Beverly Hills address for ""The Firm"" are no longer good.  And of course, the Dallas addresses found in the Wide Open Spaces liner notes and some old fan club materials have been shut down for years.  Mail sent to any of those addresses will be returned to you.\n\n \n\nWriting to or calling the Chicks or their management is not likely to increase your chances of meeting them.  In fact, they will probably never see it.\n\n \n\nIf you believe that you are the first person to write to them and tell them that you are their “biggest fan,” and that they have changed your life, you are kidding yourself.  They get thousands of fan letters per week, and they all sound alike.  So if you still can’t resist the urge to write to them, at least strive for a little originality.  Unfortunately, they will probably never see it.  But if by some slim chance they do, you are much more likely to be remembered if you have something unique to say.\n\n \n\nThe Dixie Chicks do not answer their fan mail.  They are only human, and they simply do not have time to read or reply to thousands of letters per week.  Not even mail from their “biggest fan.”   But their office personnel will sometimes send photographs to fans that request them.  Your best chance of a reply is if you include a stamped and self-addressed 8x10 envelope with your request.\n\n\n\nI hope this helps you....................................................  :-O",4059

Now, there are a few exceptions, as there always are with taxes.  Your parents can't file as Married Filing Separately.  If they file as Married Filing Jointly, they can't claim the entire $2,500 if their adjusted gross income (AGI - bottom number on the front page of their 1040) is above $105,000, and they can't claim any of it if their AGI is above $135,000.

However, after a year with George I am very attached to him as well. I would like to choose Joe, but my religion is very strict and I would run the risk of my family and even my church treating me badly. I would also be walking into the unknown.

I know that both of these guys truly do love me and I am really attached to and care about both of them. I also believe that I could be happy with either one. What do I do? ; I think you should choose the person who you feel you enjoy being with most.  If this is a decision on which of the two you want to spend your life with, I understand why your family and your church's opinion makes a difference.  However, they will not be seeing him everyday, for the rest of their lives.  They won't be kissing him, listening to his opinions, his problems, his good days and bad days.  After church service is over and your family goes back to their home, the two of you will be left alone to live your lives.  It seems you should base your decision on who you truly, truly feel the most feelings for, and who you can see fitting into your life for a long period of time.  Hope that helps :)",4113

0,"Why should we suffer an infinite punishment for finite sins? ; The Bible says ""an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.""  That is the law of justice, where the punishment must equal the crime.  How does eternal hell fit into this vision of justice?  If I spend 1 second gossiping, should I have to suffer a gazillion billion decades of the worst imaginable torture for that?  How is that just?  \n\nJesus is said to have suffered all the torture we deserved.  Yet he only suffered for a finite time.  But supposedly, we deserve an infinite amount of punishment for all the sins we commit.  How is that understandable? ; But your sin isn't finite, because it's a sin against God's holy standard.  He set the way things are to be, if you do something contrary to that, you've sinned against God, not a finite being.  I saw an article that said if you slap a foreign dignitary or someone in authority, that is a worse offense than slapping joe blow down the street.  Both slaps took the same time to commit, but one is a greater transgression.  So it is with God, only God's nature is infinite, so wouldn't that make the sin infinite?  If the sin is infinite, so the punishment must be.  \n\nJesus suffered an finite amount of time, but he was an infinite being (Christians believe Jesus was God).  So his sacrifice was infinite to atone for our sins that were infinite.  I'm not really well versed in the theology of this, but basic Christian teaching is that the only one who could atone for our sins was an infinite being, thats why it's wrong for a Christian to teach that Jesus was not God, but that he atoned for our sins.  Logically, it would be impossible.\n\nIf you want, email me, and I can ask my pastor, he has a Ph.D in philosophy and is a Christian.  I realize you may not agree with what he has to say, but in any case, you could hear a logical answer to your question to better understand what Christians believe.",4118

5,"i need to know some  stunts? ; I am a coach for a 75lb cheerleading squad and i need to know some stunts for my squad,also how to start a basket toss we need it for the competition ; The above way is one way to do it.  One of our flyers is about 90 pounds, and we figured out an easier way to get more height out of her basket toss.  The two bases each grab their left wrist to make a right angle, and then grab the other bases wrist, to make a square.  The front spot holds underneath the hands, just like in a normal basket toss.  Now, the backspot counts off, 1, 2 - on 2, the backspot puts the flyer in the ""basket"" and the flyer stays their until ready to ""fire"".  Flyer should have their hands on the bases shoulders, elbows out, and shoulders square.  The backspot then grabs the back of the flyers ankles and counts off 1,2 - on two, everyone bounces once, and then throws the flyer in the air.  This gets more height because it allows the flyer to push off better instead of relying on the bases to throw her up in the air right away.\n\nEasy stunts for small girls could include small pyramids or small lifts without a backspot.  Take two bases and a flyer.  Set up one base in a pocket (deep lunge) and another across from her in a prep stance (bent knees, straight back, hands together with palms facing up.)  With both hands on the bases shoulders, the flyer sets one foot in the pocket and bounces into the other bases prep stance.  The base with the prep stance lifts and turns the flyers foot so the the base is now perpendicular with the pocket base and the the flyer now has one foot down in the pocket and one foot up in a prep sideways.

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

They can be conservative, they can be liberal and you don't need statistics to tell you you're right. You only need to make sure it's something both of you can live with. You both must compromise on this one. For example, maybe your partner feels you are unreasonable about your level of social interaction. IE you don't like having people over enough, while he/she would love it if people were over all day long everyday. Maybe the compromise is setting up limits, like ok Monday and Wed nights are open and you can have people over but the other nights you need to ask...or maybe, as soon as you are aware someone is coming over, please let me know. Or maybe its a matter of establishing hours or something. Point is, you need to be able to find a happy medium. If you can't there might be deeper issues you need to look into resolving.

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199

If someone were to be stereotyped as emo, they would generally keep to themselves, be more timid than others, and not really want to do anything about it.

1,"Please tell me what we did wrong with this proof.  The question is:Let a,b and c be integers such that c.....? ; divides a*b. Then either c divides a or c divides b.\nFirst, we tried a bunch of examples, like when c=3 and ab=27, so a =3 and b=9, and you see that c divides a and c divides b.  Or another one is when c=7 and ab=56, so a=7 and b=8, and we know that 7 divides 56 and also 7 divides 7. Also, if c=12 and a=5 and b=24, then ab=120, and you see that c divides 120, and slo c divides b, which is all we need because the conjecture is an ""or"" statement so we only need one of the conditions to be true.  So we decided that the conjecture is true. Proof: Let a,band c be integers. We will prove the conjecture by contrapositive. So we assume that c doesn't divide a and that c doesn't divide b. We will show that c doesn't divide a*b. Since c doesn't dived a, then we know that a doesn't = c*m. Also, c doesn't divide b, so we know that b doesn't = s*n. So ab doesn't = (cm)(cn)=c(cmn). Now, cmn is an integer q(since c,m and n are all integers).Thus ab doesn't = cq for any int q. So c doesn't divide ab. ; Well, the basic problem you've run into is that the conjecture isn't true.  If a = 6, b = 3, and c = 9, then a*b = 18, and 18/9 = 2, but neither 6 nor 3 is divisible by 9.\n\nTo prove that something is true you must prove it is true for all possible values of the variables, in this case a, b, and c.  However, to prove something is false, you need only supply a single counter-example.  Thus the above example disproves the conjecture that for all integers a, b, and c if a*b is divisible by c then a or b is also divisible by c.\n\nNote that a ≠ cm and b ≠ cn does not imply that ab ≠ c(cmn).  For example, if a = 6, b = 8, c = 2, m = 4, and n = 3, then cm = 2*3 = 8 ≠6 so cm ≠ a, and cn = 2 * 3 = 6 ≠ 8 so cn ≠ b.  However, (cm)(cn) = 2 * 4 * 2 * 3 = 48, and a * b = 6 * 8 = 48, so ab = (cm)(cn).  This proves that you cannot multiply not-equalities (i.e. statements with ""doesn't equal).\n\nAlso, concluding that if c does not divide a or b implies that c does not divide ab is not the same as concluding that if c does divide ab it must also divide a or b.  This logical fallacy is equivalent to the statement that for all plants, not a tree implies not a rock, so being a rock implies being a tree.  The first statement is true: all plants that are not trees are also not rocks.  However, the second statement is clearly false, as no rocks are also trees.",4219

Let me explain how it works.  \n\nWhen you jump and stretch (some muscle groups), compressive forces act on your spine and intervertebral disks.  Some of the forces are vertical, some are interdiagonal.  Your disks are collagen packets filled with water. As you jump and stretch (specific muscles) you decrease the amount of water inside the disks part of which help make up the height of your torso.  Throughout the course of the day this happens naturally anyway, however physical activity such as those activities mentioned can accerlate the process.  As you sleep and rest, the water is then reabsorbed.  That's why people are typically up to 0.5 inches taller in the morning.",4267

I am a tenth generation American, with an extensive heritage blending for more than two hundred years.\nIllegal Immigration is not about Racism, Americans are Americans no matter your previous homeland was, or your color.\nHowever, proper immigration is about respecting our laws, and protecting the citizens you want to welcome you.\nThe only people that will call you racist, are those that do not want you to stand up and fight against them.\nThey know as well as anyone else, Illegal Immigration is the greatest danger to America, and they will use fear of a back lask on the greatest offenders, and call it racism, in a lame attempt to stop you.  it won't work with me, besides I don't know an American of any color that has not been called racist, at one time another.\nIllegal Mexican Imm. and Mexican Americans are the only ones screaming it about race, and by the millions that took to the streets to defy us.

2,"I have a problem when I do any physical exercise I tend to fart a lot and sometimes I follow....? ; through with a tiny bit of excrement.  Is this normal? ; This happens to me sometimes.. it could be the sign of a high-fiber diet and your body's struggling to metabolize food at the rate at which you're using energy.  Digestion of food produces waste gases.  For example, yesterday I got on my bicycle and rode almost 60 miles.. halfway during the exercise, the farting started, and now today it's still happening.. my body may not have yet caught up with refueling the 3000 calories I burned.\nThe excrement might be caused by what you're eating.

I really have more of a problem with the government lying and saying they are doing something about the illegal immigration.  The fact is, they let it happen because it is part of the broader plan to make Canada/United States/Mexico one economic entity.  This will at some point lead to one country.

1,"Why do some caterpillars hand from webs? ; The little skinny green caterpillars at my daughter's kinder often dangle from the trees by a web like thread.  She would like to know why they do?  Also where in their bodies do they make the webs?  Do you know what kind they might be? ; Many different types of tree-leaf feeding caterpillars do this; there are at least two reasons. As forex says - if a predator, like a spider, approaches, some species drop on a line of silk to avoid getting eaten. At other times and with other types of caterpillars, they dangle on a line because they're ready to turn into moths. They need a safer place to make a cocoon and pupate so they dangle until it feels right and then, hopefully, the wind will blow them into a lower, warmer and safer place to spend the winter in their cocoon. In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look. They spin silk from modified salivary glands which secrete a strong, elastic thread through spinnerets right next to their mouths; it’s similar to spider silk but their own recipe.",4300

I will add my two cents. I think your .357 will be adequate provided you have the right ammunition. The shortest barrel I would go with would be a 6 inch barrel (my preferred home defense gun is a 6 inch K38 with Hydra-shocks... it's not too long because no intruder is going to get close enough to grab it!). A .357 has it's limitations... I would keep my maximum distance to the distance at which I can keep 6 shots on a 6 inch paper pie plate. \n\nYour ammuntion: if you limiit yourself to factory soft points and jacketed hollow points... get a .44 Magnum. Your hunting round should be of a semi-wadcutter design. The flat part of the semi-wadcutter is called a metplat... the larger the metplat, the more shock you induce which is good for dropping the animal. You want the shoulders to be as sharp as possible. Your .357 with this type of bullet should be more than adequate for deer to 40 or 50 yards, and perhaps, smaller black bear. \n\nWhile I own a couple of .357s, I bought a Smith .41 Magnum for hunting. The .41 has greater muzzle energy than the .357, with less recoil than the .44. When you compare a .41 and a .44 the difference in wound cavity size is 0.019 inches in diameter. In many respects, from this angle, the .41 is a better hunting round than the .44. Therefore, I would suggest you give the .41 serious consideration as a hunting round. I have also assembled a handload I call a "".41 Special"" that I found in the RCBS cast bullet handloading booklet that shoots like a .38 Special. That big revolver with a nice big hole in it, can be real intimidating if you're looking at it from the wrong end. \n\nIf you plan on handgun hunting give serious consideration to casting your own bullets and handloading your hunting ammunition. \n\nI would suggest you look at either an L-framed S&W .357 or an N-framed S&W .357 or .41. The new Smith L and N frames are factory drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Because you stated home defense, in addition to hunting I have not recommended Ruger's single action Blackhawks... only because (by design) they can not be reloaded quickly like a swing out cylinder revolver. \n\nGood luck.",4330

Over the counter available is Lac-Hydrin 5 which is 5% AHA.  The doctor can prescribe Lac-Hydrin 12% which is more effective.  Be careful of the other available alpha-hydroxy acids out there as they may have too high of a pH to be effective.  Increasing the consumption of omega 3 fatty acids such as those found in salmon and cold-water fish and increasing the dietary intake of gamma-linolinic acid can also help smooth the skin. Take Borage seed oil (found in health food stores) twice a day or per bottle instructions.  You should start to see smoother skin in about 3-6 months.",4345

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory enhancer and anti-vertigo agent. However, studies differ about its efficacy.\n\nOut of the many conflicting research results, there seem to be basically three effects of Ginkgo extract on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals (antioxidant); and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders. Ginkgo can be used for intermittent claudication.\n\n Side effects\nGinkgo may have some undesirable effects, especially for individuals with blood circulation disorders and those taking anti-coagulants such as aspirin and warfarin, although recent studies have found that ginkgo has little or no effect on the anticoagulant properties or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. Ginkgo should also not be used by people who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) or by pregnant women without first consulting a doctor.\n\nGinkgo side effects and cautions include: possible increased risk of bleeding, gastrointestinal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, dizziness, and restlessness.\n\nIf any side effects are experienced consumption should be halted immediately. Ginkgo supplements are usually taken in the range of 40–200 mg per day. If the side effects continue usage should be stopped completely.\n\nAnd that's My Best Answer!",4465

I do not implied that they should forget their culture, but they came here fro the opportunity and this country can give it to them if they want it. ; I don't mind the flag waving, I think the border needs to be sealed.

1,"What substance is the pico Graviton and what makes it move? ; Autodynamics theory(Ricardo Carezani) ; Well the Pico Graviton is supposedly the predicted particle of ""electromuon"" not a substance per say but much like a photon.  It is used in the theory of auto-dynamics in which classical physics are altered in an attempt to describe the nature of gravity.\n\n  The current theory of relativity generally fits most situations in which gravity must be calculated.  (It's a rough equation)  But it does not account for such things as atomic decay.  Or the absorption of this ""electromuon"" which seems to accelerate electrons, causing them to spread out (bigger atom means less in the same space and means less atoms per volume (basically the effect of heating).\n\n  In essence Ricardo Carezani is attempting to describe gravity as the pull caused by the loss of these electromuon particles and the pull to return them to the atom.  \n\n  A pico Graviton is a electromuon which is much like a photon or a particle of light.",4480

3,"Chemistry homework help, Dimentonal analysis for moles and atoms in amounts of sodium. HELP!? ; Its for a chemistry project, I need help, my teacher hasnt been in class for the last week, so I have absolutely no idea what ""mol"" is.\n\nHere are the exact steps:\n1. Cut out 3 nutrition facts labels from three different foods. One should be high in sodium compared to the others.\n2. Look for the total grams of ""Sodium"" per serving.\n3. Using dimensional analysis, show haow many moles and atoms of sodium you are eating for one serving.\n4. How many servings of food would you have to eat in order to reach the maximum daily recommended amount of sodium.\n\nIve got the three labels, they are:\n\n1. Frozen Waffles - 480mg of sodium - 20% daily value\n2.Gatorade - 110mg of sodium - 5% daily value\n3.Juice - 35mg of sodium - 1% daily value. ; To get the no. of moles of sodium in each serving, you must use the equation: no. of moles = mass / relative molecular mass\nThe realtive molecular mass of sodium (Na) is 23 (from periodic table of elements) \nSo for the waffles, the 480mg must first be converted to grams. There are 1000 mg in 1g so there are 0.480g of sodium in the waffles. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in the waffles is:\nno. of moles = 0.480g / 23g = 0.02moles\n\nFor the gatorade, the 110mg is converted to grams also, which is 0.110g. Therefore the no. of moles of Na in gatorade is:\nno. of moles = 0.110g / 23g = 0.0048 moles\n\nLikewise for the juice, the 35mg is converted to grams which is 0.035g. The no. of moles of Na in this is:\nno. of moles = 0.035g / 23g = 0.0015moles\n\nTo find the amount of atoms of sodium in each of the samples we use the following equation:\nno. of atoms = no. of moles x 6x10^23 x no. of atoms per entity\n\n(6x10^23 = Avogadros constant)\nno. of atoms per entity = 1 (because there is only one atom of Na in Na)\n\nTherefore, in the waffles the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.02 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 1.2x10^22\n\nFor the gatorade, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0048 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 2.88x10^21\n\nFor the juice, the no. of atoms is:\nno. of atoms = 0.0015 x 6x10^23 x 1\nno. of atoms = 9x10^20\n\nFinally to find out how many servings you would need to get your full recommended daily allowance (RDA), you must do the following:\n\nWaffles: 0.48g is 20% of your RDA\n               0.024g is 1% of your RDA\n               2.4g is 100% RDA\n               Therefore you would need 2.4g / 0.48g = 5servings\n\nGatorade:0.110g is 5% of your RDA\n                0.022g is 1% of your RDA\n                2.2G IS 100% of your RDA\n                Therefore you would need 2.2g / 0.110g = 20servings\n\nJuice: 0.035g is 1% of your RDA\n          3.5G IS 100% of your RDA\n          Therefore you would need 3.5g / 0.035g = 100 servings\n\n\nHope Ive been of help to you!!!\nIf you've anymore questions just ask!",4486
9,"How dare they make mace illegal? Why? ; The government fails to keep so many creeps behind bars and then has the audacity to tell us women that we can't carry mace around for the sole purpose of self defense. I think we all have the right to go for a peaceful walk without fear of being stabbed or raped. And what perplexes me is that we're allowed to carry bear spray in bear country, but not allowed to carry mace in predatory lunatic country, which can be just about anywhere, even in the most tranquil of suburbs. ; Before you get over worked over this issue, you need to know some facts.\n\nMace has limited ability in stopping attackers and some people are not in the least affected by it. Pepper spray is much more effective, but also has problems.\n\nMost people (non-police) who carry the stuff are not trained when and how to use it and are depending on it for their front line of defense. They also will tend to get in to a bit of a panic if attacked, grab it and spray. If the wind is in the wrong direction, the mace/pepper spray may blow back on them, leaving the assailant untouched. It can also be very difficult to incapacitate a person who is very drunk and/or on drugs. The small cans of spray can also leak over time and not work when you really need it.\n\nConsider also, since mace/pepper spray is legal, the bad guys/gals can get it too and can easily get you before you get them.\n\nThere are many effective means of self defense, if one takes the time to learn the methods, that can give you a chance to get out of a confrontation. I suggest you look into them.\n\nOne clue. learning to keep your cool when a surprise situation unfolds and quickly evaluate your options is the best front line of defense you can develop. The next clue is to use your hands, your head, and whatever is handy. Has worked well for me for many years through situations you will most likely never become involved in.",4487

2,"I'm on a v.low fat diet due to gall bladder probs. I also have a wheat & peanut allergy and IBS. Eating out? ; I'm a little bit sick of cooking for myself :) I'm on holidays and would like to just once be able to go out to a restaurant with my partner and order something I know won't make me sick (that isn't plain boiled rice). Any ideas? ; 1. as far as your gall bladder problem, several studies have shown that fatty meals may not play as much of a role in the colicky type of pain associated with either stones or a malfunctioning gall bladder, however all the patients I treat and including myself who has what is called ""cholelithiasis"" find that certain meals will set off an attack. It is probably a good idea when you eat to have several small meals per day rather than the traditional three meals. Smaller portions throughout the day may help with your gall bladder pains.\n2. Now for your diagnosis of IBS. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion which means you must rule out other more ominous causes, ie. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis both can be detected with a colonoscopy. Additionally, you should be tested for what is called ""gluten sensitivity"" and ""celiac sprue"". There are blood tests that can shed light on these disorders such as a test called ""gliadin antibodies"". Your GI doctor may also want to take some biopsies of your colon during the colonscopy so a Pathologist can microscopically determine what type if any inflammation is going on and what the mucosal lining of the intestine looks like. Flattening of the mucosa may be indicative of some of the diseases I mentioned previously. \n3. When you go out to eat, the problem is that if you are allergic to peanuts, many times they will cook with peanut oil and there may even be remnants of peanuts or the oil in preparing your food. This can be very dangerous. I had a patient several years ago who was allergic to peanuts and ate out at McDonalds I believe and there were trace amounts of peanuts or peanut oil which threw him into anaphylactic shock; thank goodness he survived. So you have to be very very careful and let the restaurant know that you are allergic to peanuts, oils, or any by product of peanuts. \nI hope this helps you. You should speak to a Gastroenterologist and have a colonoscopy and some blood work to check for the antibodies. Gluten sensitivity usually goes hand in hand with wheat allergies. There are newer medications that will help with irritable bowel syndrome. Zelnorm is the one that comes to mind. For some reason when it first came to market it was only for women, I assume because most cases of IBS are in females, but more recent studies show that it can be effective in relieving the symptoms of IBS in men too.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",4564

There are over 4000 toxins in cigarette smoke. Most of them are still unknown. Nicotine is probably the worst toxin as it stops and eventually kills the epithelial cells in the lining of the lung, these cells have tiny hairs that usually ""beat"" upwards causing the mucus to come up to your throat and get swalloed. With that not working, mucus accumulates in the lung. When you smoke your mucus in filled with those 4000 toxins and your body reacts by secreting an enzyme called ""trypsin"" into your lungs. Trypsin is the same enzyme that your stomach uses to digest steak. Think of how powerfull it is. After years of smoking, your lungs will have been exposed to so much trypsin that you will litterally have holes in your lung.

1,"how are michelson's interferometers used ?(to calculate wavelength of light  etc)? ; can someone help it with diagrams ; A Michelson interferometer is like a very very sensitive ruler that measures in wavelengths of light. Visible light has a wavelength between about 400 and 800nm (10^-9 meters). Thus the distances we can measure are pretty small.\n\nThe basic operation of a Michelson interferometer is like this: You take a laser (because laser light is monochromatic and coherent), and then split the beam. We need the light to be monochromatic, that is, having only one wavelength present (633nm for a HeNe laser, common in the lab). Once split, the laser is put on two different paths, these should be at right angles to each other. They are then reflected back along the same path and recombined. If the distance in one leg was greater than that in the other leg, we'll see an interference pattern due to the different number of wavelenghts that fit along the different paths.\n\nSo it is an instrument for measuring differential length. The idea was that you could use this to look for the ""ether."" This was an idea in the early 20th century that there must be some medium for light waves to ""wave in."" By analogy, water waves are movements in the medium of water. So there should be (the thinking went) that there is an ether that carries light waves.\n\nWell, the way to test  this idea is to think about how the earth moves. If there was an ether the earth would be moving through it at some speed, in the direction that the earth is moving, we'd measure a different speed of light than in a direction at a right angle (orthogonal) to the motion of the earth. So you set up your Michelson interferometer, and see if you can get interference patterns that could only be due to the different speeds of light in different directions.\n\nThe experiments revealed that there was no such thing as an ether.",4633

2,"i need info on hole in upper left chamber of heart please help? ; my 7 year old brother has this problem please help me thank you ; look at the noted citation\n \n   \nWhat Is ...  \nHow the Heart Works  \nCauses  \nSigns & Symptoms  \nDiagnosis  \nTreatments  \nLiving With  \nKey Points  \nLinks  \n \n    What Is Atrial Septal Defect? \nAn atrial septal defect (ASD) is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two upper chambers (atria) of the heart. The defect allows blood to flow from one atrium to the other, usually from the left side to the right side. This causes extra blood flow:\n\nIn the right atrium \nIn the right ventricle \nTo the lungs \n\n\nFigure A shows the normal anatomy and blood flow of the interior of the heart. Figure B shows a heart with an atrial septal defect, which allows oxygen-rich blood from the left atrium to mix with oxygen-poor blood from the right atrium. \n\nIn a normal heart, oxygen-poor (blue) blood returns from the body to the right atrium. From the right atrium, the blue blood flows to the right ventricle—one of the two lower chambers of the heart—and is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen. After traveling through the lungs, the blood is now oxygen-rich and red. The red blood returns from the lungs to the left atrium and goes to the left ventricle, where it is pumped to the body. The right and left sides of the heart are normally completely separated by the septum. The septum keeps the blue blood from mixing with the red blood. The later section ""How the Heart Works"" explains the process in greater detail.\n\nASD is the second most common congenital heart defect.\n\nMore than 3,000 babies are born with ASD each year in the United States. \nASD occurs twice as often in girls as in boys. \nEffects of Atrial Septal Defect\nOver time, the extra blood flow to the right side of the heart and the lungs can cause:\n\nEnlargement of the right atrium and the right ventricle. \nRight heart overload. The right side of the heart has to work harder to pump extra blood to the lungs, especially as resistance in the pulmonary (PULL-mun-ary) artery increases. Over time, the heart may become overworked, and function may become impaired. This is exceedingly rare with modern methods of diagnosis and treatment. \nIrregular heartbeats or rhythms (arrhythmias). Extra blood flowing into the right atrium through the ASD can cause the atrium to stretch and enlarge. When this occurs, a fast heartbeat can develop with symptoms such as dizziness, fainting, or chest discomfort. \nStroke. Occasionally a blood clot in a vein or in the right side of the heart can pass through the ASD and enter the blood stream, where it can block an artery supplying the brain and cause a stroke. \nPulmonary artery hypertension. This is when high blood pressure exists in the arteries that carry blood to the lungs. The extra blood being pumped to the lungs can increase the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. Over time, high pressure can damage the arteries and the small blood vessels in the lungs. They thicken and become stiff, making it harder for blood to flow through them (pulmonary vascular disease). \nUsually, most of these effects don’t show up until adulthood, often around age 30 or later. They are rare in infants and children.\n\nCharacteristics\nAn ASD is classified by its size and location.\n\nSize\nThe size of an ASD can range from small to large.\n\nMost small defects close on their own as the heart grows during childhood. They usually allow only a small amount of blood to flow between the atria. \nModerate to large defects are much less likely to close on their own. They allow two or more times the normal amount of blood to flow through the right side of the heart. Large holes sometimes cause symptoms during infancy or childhood. \nLocation\nThree major types of ASD exist, based on the location of the defect on the septum:\n\nSecundum. This defect is in the middle of the septum. It is the most common form of ASD. About 7 out of every 10 babies born with ASD have this type. This type often closes on its own, unless it is large. \nPrimum.",4651

1,"can you drink gasoline ? what would the results be? ; I'm serious here.\nNow by gasoline i mean regular gas, that you put in your automobile.\nI expectantly understand that it's very likely to produce vomiting, but are  there any other effects?\nAlso how long (on average) would you expect before these symptoms set in?\nDon't worry I'm NOT encoraging poisoning, and obviously don't intend to do this myself.\nBut i really was wondering has there been any research on the matter. ; Gasoline is a mild skin, eye, and respiratory tract irritant. Ingestion of gasoline causes mild to severe irritation to the gastrointestinal mucosa; chemical pneumonitis is often severe. Systemic effects of gasoline exposure are mainly a result of CNS depression. \nSystemic effects can occur from all routes of exposure. Exposure to low concentrations may produce flushing of the face, staggering gait, slurred speech, and mental confusion. Higher concentrations may result in unconsciousness, coma, and possible death due to respiratory failure. \nGasoline vapors sensitize the myocardium which may result in ventricular fibrillation. Delayed effects may include hemorrhage of the pancreas and fatty degeneration of the liver and of the proximal convoluted tubules and glomeruli of the kidneys. \nAcute Exposure\nMost adverse health effects from acute exposure to gasoline are caused by the hydrocarbon component. However, persons who have repeated or massive exposure (e.g., inhalation abuse, prolonged skin contact) to leaded gasoline may develop lead poisoning (lead is no longer added to gasoline in the United States). Immediate effects of exposure to gasoline are primarily due to pulmonary injury and CNS depression. Other systemic effects may develop over several hours. Components of gasoline probably crosses the placenta and may be excreted in breast milk.\n\nChildren do not always respond to chemicals in the same way that adults do. Different protocols for managing their care may be needed.\n\nCNS\nAcute gasoline exposure can cause transient CNS excitation followed by CNS depression. Confusion, giddiness, nausea, headache, blurred vision, dizziness, and weakness can occur. In massive exposures, rapid CNS depression, respiratory depression, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, and death have been reported. \n\nRespiratory\nGasoline can irritate the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Pulmonary congestion, edema, acute exudative tracheobronchitis, and intrapulmonary hemorrhage have been reported in severe exposures. Pulmonary aspiration of ingested gasoline may cause pneumonitis.\n\nExposure to certain chemicals can lead to Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS), a chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma.\n\nChildren may be more vulnerable because of relatively increased minute ventilation per kg and failure to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.\n\nHydrocarbon pneumonitis may be a problem in children.\n\nCardiovascular\nGasoline vapors sensitize the myocardium to circulating epinephrine which may cause potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation.\n\nRenal\nInhalation of massive amounts of gasoline may result in fatty degeneration of the proximal convoluted tubules and glomeruli and renal failure. Ingestion of gasoline has been reported to cause oliguria, tubular necrosis, interstitial edema, hematuria, reduced creatinine clearance and elevated serum creatinine, elevated urinary protein, glucose, and hemoglobin, and elevated BUN.\n\nGastrointestinal\nDamage to the digestive tract following ingestion of gasoline may include severe esophagitis, gastritis, degeneration of the epithelium, and mucositis of the oral cavity.\n\nDermal\nGasoline vapors can cause inflammation of the skin. Prolonged contact with liquid gasoline causes significant irritation (i.e., irritant contact dermatitis), degreasing, and burns. Redness and blisters may occur.\n\nOcular\nEye irritation from gasoline vapors begins at about 200 ppm. Inflammation is generally slight. When splashed in the eye, gasoline may cause burning pain and transient corneal injury. Chronic exposure to gasoline may cause damage to the cornea, retina, and ciliary body.\n\nPotential Sequelae\nAcute hydrocarbon-induced CNS depression generally is completely reversible after exposure ceases unless the episode has been complicated by lack of oxygen. Acute renal toxicity may persist for several weeks following ingestion of gasoline, but usually resolves with treatment. Chro",4657

What is wrong with the American education system?\n\nAlso why do so many people on this website seem to think that this website is only used by Americans? There are many other people using it too so how about you try considering that when you ask questions ; OK abc here is a serious answer to your question. We live so far away from everywhere else (even south America and/or Canada for most of the US) that we just have not had the experience. I'm think i am more knowledgable than most ppl i know, on Europe anyway, since my in-laws are from Liverpool and one of my good friends and her hubby are Irish, but i don't think most ppl in the US even know a person that is from another country (that is not a S. Am country). I know if you live in Englad, Germany, Spain, Italy ect...you can fly to another country in a matter of a few hours and it is fairly cheap. Honestly most Americans would love to be able to visit (can I stay at your house lol) but it is to expensive. I think this goes along with the education question. Its not that we don't learn our history, it is just much easier to remember something if you have visited the place (i can give you quite a detailed account of the Alamo) or if your family was involved (Revolution, cilvil war). If you are wondering if we learn about the daily habits (such as food perference, job opportunities, fashion) of the modern English at school no we don't, but I really don't think that it would be the job of the school to teach this.\n\n\nI also think that the reason we love accents is because we rarely hear them! We would sit and listen to someone from England, Ireland, Scotland, Australia all day....you guys are really popular here lol\n\nI was wondering about the nationalities of the users on this site...is there a way to see that?",4712

The gent subcontracted us for a big project. The original owner of this project is not this  agent. Now the original owner is using our product but does not have any idea they are using unpaid product. Now the middle man ""the agency who gave us the project"" collected all the money from the original client but refused to pay us. Now my question is do we have an intellectual property on the product? 2. How to make  the agency to pay us. We have all the paper work and agreement but could not find a good collection agency they can tackle this client. What is the best way for us to get our money.\n\nAny idea? ; If you invented or developed the product you have the initial intellectual property rights. You need to protect these by having them registered. If you have not done so and the other party registers them you will have to take steps to have the register corrected. To collect money from an overseas UK client you would have to take out a writ and serve this according to the rules of court. If the writ is not challenged then you can have a judgement awarded in your favour otherwise you will need to prove that the amount is owed. Whether you went through an agent or not is irrelevant as the principal is responsible for the acts of his agents. You should, however, consider naming the agent as a party in your writ. When you have a judgement this can be registered with the High Court in London and will be enforceable against the client.",4714

So, an isolated incedent should not be held against someone. \nDo I think anyone should drive with a baby on their lap absolutly NOT....the child should have been in a car seat in the back. \nAs for the head fracture, I don't know anything about that or how it happened so I can't say whether it was due to her neglect or abuse.  Accidents do happen....even when the child has great parents. \nNone of us are in a postion to sit back and place judgement on anyone. As parents we are responsible for taking care of, providing for and loving our children. Some parents just don't have a good balance between them. A parent can love their child with all of their heart and not be equiped to take care of them or support them properly, a parent can provide for and take care of their child and yet still not show enough or adequate love for their child. \nParenting is not an easy job....and no matter what you do as a parent there is always someone that will find fault in something you do or in choices you make. \nAll we can do is be the best parent we can be....even if it means taking parenting classes to help us obtain the skills needed. \nMore often than not, the families that have child protective services involved are good people trying to do the best they can....flat out abuse just for the sake of abuse is not the norm.\nPassing judgement and talking bad about it is not going to solve the problem....\nIf a child is being abused or neglected in any way, someone needs to step in and be sure that the child gets into a home where it will be properly cared for on all levels. The natural parent needs to do things to become a better parent ... prosecution and ridicule by the public is not going to teach the person how to be a better parent.  She needs to work on that and others need to stand up and offer some help and support.... that will help far more than us putting them down.",4731

Your answer is mostly appreciate ; Looking forwards to hear from you, for I need ur support! ; I feel sorry for your anxiety caused by your phobia and for the other people writing about their phobias in your answer column. I to have suffered with many different phobias; as a child it was injections (both dentists and doctors), and Dogs; now it is the feeling of fear itself that I fear. (Because of years of panic attacks)\n\nI can tell you what helps, if you need to take an oral pill (tranquilizer) if you are really bad (one every night before going to bed for a short time) or (half an hour before you need to go to the doctor for an appointment involving an injection). \n*However this will not teach you too become brave or help you cope with your underlining fear which has become a phobia. \n\nI suggest you learn to relax through different sources.\n\nFirstly you can do positive self talk as your fear comes from negative thoughts causing you to have a chemical release in the brain which in turn causes the physical sensations of heart racing, sweating, feelings of faintness, fear, anxiety, nausea, light headedness, numbness, and so on…..oh yeah feelings of unreality is another one.\n\nNext learn relaxation or meditation either through physical participation in yoga classes or by listening to these sorts of cd, tape, or videos.

5,"facts about javelen? ; history ; Javelin throw\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nA high school athlete throwing the javelin.The javelin throw is an athletics (track and field) throwing event where the object to be thrown is the javelin, a spear-like object made of metal, fibreglass and, in some cases, carbon fiber. Because of its potential danger, it is not always included in track and field meets; for instance, Michigan high school track and field does not include javelin.\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Competition and throws \n2 Javelin redesigns \n3 History and the javelin at the Olympics \n4 World records \n5 Famous Javelin Throwers \n5.1 Women \n5.2 Men \n5.3 Top Ten longest throwers of all time (current 1986 model)- men \n \n\n\n[edit]\nCompetition and throws\nRules are similar to other throwing events: Competitors take three throws or six when they are placed to the eighth position, their best legal throw is recorded and the winner is the individual with the longest legal throw measured to the nearest centimeter. The javelin's point must touch the ground first for the throw to be legal. The most noticeable difference with the other events is that rather than a throwing circle as used in discus, shot put and hammer throw, the competitors have a run-up area coated with the same surface used for running tracks, and a painted line on the surface from which they must release the javelin. The run-up culminates in a 40 degree fan emanating from a point 8m behind the line. Throws are measured from the point of landing to the inside of the painted line with the measuring tape co-linear with the point of landing and the focal point of the fan. Javelin throwers also normally use spikes unlike other throwers, with eleven small spikes on each shoe. Many athletic tracks have javelin run-ups at each end to take advantage of any potential wind benefit.\n\nJavelin throwers gain considerable forward velocity in their run-up to their throws, and as well as strength demonstrate athleticism more similar to running and jumping events. Thus, the athletes share more similar physical characteristics to those athletes rather than the bulky frames of the strength throwers. At release, a javelin can reach speeds approaching 70 mph (113 km/h).\n\n[edit]\nJavelin redesigns\nIn 1986, the men's javelin (800 g) was redesigned because of the prodigious distances being thrown culminating in a world record throw of over 104m by the then East German thrower, Uwe Höhn. The javelin throw was in danger of being banished to outside the arena on safety grounds so the javelin was redesigned so that the centre of gravity was moved further away from the centre of pressure (the point at which the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag act) so that the javelin had a downward pitching moment. This brings the nose down earlier, reducing the flight distance by around 10% and also causing the javelin to stick in. In 1999, the women's javelin (600g) was similarly redesigned.\n\n\nModifications that manufacturers made to recover some of the lost distance, by increasing tail drag (using holes, rough paint or dimples), were outlawed at the end of 1991 and marks made using implements with such modifications removed from the record books.\n\n[edit]\nHistory and the javelin at the Olympics\nThe javelin throw has been part of the Summer Olympics since 1908. Although the javelin is currently used only for sport in most areas, it has a long history of use for hunting and warfare. There are, for instance, numerous references to the javelin in ancient Hellenic civilization, who practised a form of javelin throwing at the ancient Olympics. The objective there, however was to throw at a target rather than for distance.\n\n[edit]\nWorld records\nThe world record for men, at 98.48 meters, is held by Jan Železný from the Czech Republic, set at Jena, Germany, on May 25, 1996.

And when we go there we are not introducing sin b/c there is no one to introduce it to...I mean, the rocks can't exactly sin.  However, if there is life on other planets (by life I mean anything with the capability to have a soul and also to sin), Romans 8 :28 says, ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god,"" so they would already be sinners, so we could not introduce it b/c it is already there.",4766
9,"Has voter apathy ruined the U.K? In a recent survey British politicians were voted more sleazy than estate? ; agents, with that public perception, very few of the population voted and Tony Blair's Labour got another term. Labour is turning Britain into such a police state, that even the Scots want their own country, but arn't the voters to blame as well? Isn't voter apathy destroying the British way of life? ; Voting apathy is only a problem for the elected representatives (MPs and councillors) of the people.  They fear that if not enough of us turn out to vote, they will feel they do not have a mandate to govern.  I think we reached that point about fifty years ago.  If the turn out is under 50 percent, how can any politician legitimately claim to have received a mandate from the people to govern them?\n\nLocal elections are a case in point - the same shipload of cut-throats get re-elected time and time again.  They draw huge expenses (at our expense) and waist their time going on various jamborees abroad to see if the wine is safe for us to drink back home.\n\nMPs are the worse scoundrels.  Many of these thieves draw expenses amounting to £150,000 pa on top of their already bloated salaries of £60,000.  God only knows what government ministers are paid - something resembling a telephone number I should think.\n\nOn the whole I think the British people are let down badly by their representatives most of whom pay little or no attention what so ever to what we the people are saying, once they're elected that is - another five years on the jolly waggon at our expense.  And to cap it all, these people want us to pay for their political parties and their profligate spending.  Oh, never mind, the tax payer will foot the bill.  VOTE NO to that by the way.",4767

They have a right to know and will know but you should really think about how they will find this information out. Should they find out from a loving parent the information that they are seeking who will teach him/her in a educational fashion or should he find out from a friend or some pervert that will corrupt the information or distort and twist the idea. Remember that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world...The question is ""who do you want to rock your child's cradle."" Information is not just learned by giving your child books and telling to read and ask questions but it's who and how teaches them to remember what is being taught. Teach them about safe sex. When you are teaching about safe sex, that doesn't mean that they are going out there to have promiscuous sex but rather to protect themselves should things happen. It's your job as a parent to teach them the rights and wrongs. Christian or not. Better to teach them about safe sex than having them come up to you to tell you that they are pregnant out of wedlock with a guy that they just met or, worse, that they contracted STDs, HIV or AIDS!!!

DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the ""eve"" network of today's Internet. \n\nPeople behind it: Licklider, Lawrence Roberts, Paul Baran for the military\nFirst node went live: Oct 29, 1969, UCLA\nBirth place: UCLA campus\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by January 1, 1983 (this is technically the birth of the Internet), when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nName first given to it: NSFNet\nFirst operational: Jan 1 1983 (birth of internet as we know it)\nNational campuses - birthplace of internet framework\n\nAs of January 2006, over 1 billion people use the Internet according to Internet World Stats",4796

Have you contacted the Police at all? They should have a missing persons unit or a unit which deals with vulnerable missing people. I know from what you say that you have an idea where she is living but she is still a vulnerable person as it seems she is very impressionable. The Police may well be aware of the situation at this address and can therefore react quickly. \n\nAlternatively, what about local Social Services? I appreciate that you may not want to get them involved but desperate times call for desperate measures. They should have a runaway co-ordinator who can help you. \n\nAnother organisation that is really good at providing support and advice is Connexions. It is an organisation that the Police, Social or your daughter's school can put you in touch with. They have all sorts of help available for both young people aged 12-18 and their family from counselling, drug advice, literacy, careers advice, housing, anti-bullying, etc. It really would be worth speaking to these people once your daughter returns to see how they can help her. \n\nAll the very best of luck to you. xxxx",4806

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree. And when the stomata (the hole on the underside of the leaf) opens for gas exchange, one water molecule at a time evaporates from the leaf, thus pulling the chain up one by one. Hope that helps!",4875

However, if you can wait till next year you can differ your capital gains tax.\n\nIf you are putting money into the fund then it is best to invest after the distrubtion date.

Cigarette tax makes up a huge portion of the cost of cigarettes and pays a large amout of NHS costs.\n\nI don't like breathing car exhaust fumes every day and the rise in Asthma has been linked to the replacement of lead in petrol with the lung irritant Benzine.

3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

0,"Dreamcatchers..? ; I know they catch dreams or they wouldn't have that name,I know the ones I have seen are extremely beautiful,but what is the history behind them and what is it that they do besides the obvious if anything? ; The history of the dream catcher has nearly been lost in the turmoil of cultural mixing and destruction that followed on the heels of the European invasion.  Dreamcatcher history is known with some credibility due to the dedicated field work of Frances Densmore at the beginning of the last century.  She conducted a careful and extensive study of many Native American cultures including that of the Ojibwe (also known as Chippewa) living in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, Canada. A simple description can be found in her book, Chippewa Customs, published by the Minnesota Historical Society Press (St. Paul) in 1929 and reprinted in 1979.  She described articles looking like spider webs that were usually hung from the hoop of a child's cradle board.  She said that 'they catch and hold everything evil as a spider's web catches and holds everything that comes into contact with it'. These 'dream catchers' were wooden hoops with a 3 1/2 in. diameter, woven with a web made of nettle-stalk fiber that was dyed red with the red sap of the root of bloodroot or the inner bark of the wild plum tree.   A facsimile of this traditional dream catcher can be seen at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota.  The spider web dream catcher shown at the left is very similar to the original dream catcher that has been a tradition for a  very long time.  In our dream catcher weaving kits you can find the materials and instructions for weaving this classic gift for the newborn.\n\nThe common dream catcher weave seen today is the traditional weave used for other articles, most commonly the hoop for the hoop and stick game of many tribes. Woven with strong rawhide with a hole in the center, a child would roll the hoop along the ground and another would try to throw a wooden spear through the hole in the center.  Stories of the dream catcher legend that describe the dreams going through a center hole are of recent origin.  The original dream catcher had a very tiny hole in the center and the legend describes ALL dreams being caught in the weaving.\n\nFor many years, only Ojibwe people made dream catchers as each tribe made only its original crafts.  In the mid 70’s, dream catcher earrings became popular and many people of other tribes began to make dream catchers.  Not knowing how to weave the spider web or not wanting to take the extra time needed they chose the mid-point weaving style of the hoop and stick instead of the end-point weave of the ancient spider web.  Many people, not knowing the significance of the twig or not being able to find the beautiful red willow of the northern woodlands, began to use metal rings wound with leather or string.  The thread of tradition was lost.  Now in the time of the Seventh Fire, the traditions are being returned to the people.  \nEach tribe and clan, however, has its own oral tradition and memory.  Passing along that memory by storytelling has not been easy with the traditional culture challenged, the tribal languages fallen into disuse, and poverty, drugs, and conflicting values have created a climate of fear, anger, despair, and confusion.  Now there are many legends of the dreamcatcher from many different Native American cultures.  Sometimes Anishinabe tell the story of the Lakota dreamcatcher with the ""Shinob"" traditional spider web, and Lakota tell the ""Shinob"" story with their ""Lakota"" dreamcatcher.  Authenticity is difficult, if not impossible, given the intermarriage among many tribes, with non-Indians, and the loss of the continuity historically provided by traditional elders.  I have encountered a few traditional elders who wanted to learn how to weave the dreamcatcher but they could find no one in their community who would or could teach them how to weave the ancient designs of their culture.  They had come to me.  \n\nIn 1996 I taught Ojibwe people at the Rediscovery Center on t",4932

2,"Milk... cancer? ; I happen to hear this rumor about milk being a cause of Cancer.. I looked it up in google and found quite a few links regarding this... it comes to me as a shock... Is it True?? ; Cow's milk doesn't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe worst part about cow's milk is the process it goes through to get from the cow's udder to your grocery store.   Typically, it is altered beyond recognition.  It is standardized, fortified, pasteurized and homongenized.  In other words, it has been taken apart and put back together again, not always in the same proportions. Then it will be cooked and emulsified.\n\nHowever, many humans actually have mild allergies to the substance, which is nutrionally incompatible with their bodies.  In these cases, milk consumption can trigger acne outbreaks, sinusitis, constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nOn the other hand, those who experience no allergic reactions can drink it with no problems, and will wholeheartedly stand out on the streets and proclaim, ""Milk is good for you!  Drink it by the gallon!""  And for them, it may be.  But it's not for everyone.\n\nSo, what transforms an otherwise  healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens?  It all starts with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass; and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than they a traditional cow.\n\nThen, the cows are given antibiotics to keep them well. Their milk is then pasteruized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed; lactase, which assimilates lactose; galactose, which  assimilates galactose; phosphatase, for the assimilation of calcium. Literally dozens of precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteruization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to disease.\n\nHope this helped explain it a little better.  Raw, organic, whole cow's milk is in no way cancer-causing.  It's really more the process it goes through to become store-ready that could, in a sense, contribute to cancer development in some people.",4966

At this time, there was no official Jewish canon of scripture.\n\nThe Jews in Egypt translated their choices of the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek in the second century before Christ. This translation, called the Septuagint, had wide use in the Roman world because most Jews lived far from Palestine in Greek cities. Many of these Jews spoke only Greek.\n\nThe early Christian Church was born into this world. The Church, with its bilingual Jews and more and more Greek-speaking Gentiles, used the books of the Septuagint as its Bible. Remember the early Christians were just writing the documents what would become the New Testament.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, with increasing persecution from the Romans and competition from the fledgling Christian Church, the Jewish leaders came together and declared its official canon of Scripture, eliminating seven books from the Septuagint. \n\nThe books removed were Tobit, Judith, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, Wisdom (of Solomon), Sirach, and Baruch. Parts of existing books were also removed including Psalm 151 (from Psalms), parts of the Book of Esther, Susanna (from Daniel as chapter 13), and Bel and the Dragon (from Daniel as chapter 14).\n\nThe Christian Church did not follow suit but kept all the books in the Septuagint.\n\n1500 years later, Protestants decided to change its Old Testament from the Catholic canon to the Jewish canon. The books they dropped are sometimes called the Apocrypha.\n\nHere is a Catholic Bible website: http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab/bible/\n\n+ The Celibate Clergy + \n\nThe celibate clergy did not come into full bloom until about 1000 A.D. There were many married priests, bishops, and popes before this time.\n\nFirst, Judeo-Christian tradition has always held that single people be celibate. This is taught by Judaism and Christianity from before the Scriptures were written down.\n\nThe question should be: Why can't priests marry?\n\nThis idea of a celibate clergy came from the Jews, John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Apostle Paul.\n\nThe Jews. The Talmud argues that a person whose “soul is bound up with the Torah and is constantly occupied with it” may remain celibate (Maimonides, Laws of Marriage 15.3). For example, Yahweh ordered the prophet Jeremiah not to marry (Jeremiah 16:1-4). Moreover, the Essenes was a group that was active in Jesus’ time that practiced celibacy and thought by most scholars to be the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nWWJD? What would Jesus do? Jesus did not marry.\n\nJohn the Baptist and Jesus are both believed to have been celibate for their entire lives. Some scholars believe that the example of the Essenes influenced either or both Jesus and John the Baptist in their celibacy.\n\nThe Apostle Paul is explicit about his celibacy (see 1 Cor. 7). There is also evidence in the gospel of Matthew for the practice of celibacy among at least some early Christians, in the famous passage about becoming “eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matt. 19:12).  \n\nThe concept took many twists and turns over the years and will probably take a few more before Christ returns in glory.\n\nA priest is ""married"" to the Church. Some people think that a priest who takes his duties seriously cannot take proper care of a wife and family. ""A man cannot ser",4992

Especially considering the positive impact that pot can have on your health.\n\nIs it because it's hallucanigenic? Or is it some other reason? ; Well, marijuana isn't hallucinogenic...at least not normally.\n\nMy theories are a) racism b) the cotton and pharmaceutical lobby/taxation\n\nRacism--- Marijuana originally was a drug for blacks and just like Jim Crow laws, it was another way to stick it to 'em.  If you look through history, drugs only become illegal in America when associated w/ a minority group.  Take opium for instance...was enjoyed by Americans until the Chinese came to Cali to build the RR.  White men became worried that the Chinese men were seducing white women in their opium dens...so, they made it illegal as a mechanism of oppression.  \n\nLobbyists- Well, hemp is a wonderfully strong material and much more durable than cotton...and marijuana being herbal and something you could grow yourself means that pharmaceutical companies can't profit on.  \n\nThere is no good reason why marijuana is illegal, especially for medical use when oxycontin/morphine which can be deadly and is highly addictive is widely used.  It is so hypocritical.  Marijuana has been proven to treat glaucoma, and is a great pain reliever/appetite stimulant for cancer patients.\n\nFYI:  Teen drug use is lower in Amsterdam where everything is legal than is in the US.

I agree with 'andytheba..' and 'itschris', above. The line represents the STRING (top line = highest note-thinnest string, bottom line = lowest note-thickest string) \n\nThe numbers DO refer to the fret number (0 = open or un-fretted string/ 1= 1st fret on that particular string 2= 2nd fret and so on and so forth) Where a number repeats ---2-3-5-5-5-5-5--- , this indicates the number of time you pluck or pick the string\n\nTabs are designed primarily to help guide you through a A PIECE OF RECORDED MUSIC YOU EITHER KNOW OR HAVE ACCESS TO. Tabs sometimes, though rarely, contain some musical information. This is similar  to standard musical notation. A large number of tabs, however, just provide you with the basic information and you use the recording to to reference it.\n\nAn example :  ----0-2-3-5--- played on the A string (second fattest) is telling you to play the notes A, B, C and D. If the numbers read ----0-2-4-5--- they would be telling you to play the notes A, B, C# and D.   Since you already read standard music notation - the piano music - you have a glorious head start but, as I said, alot of Tablature (tabs) dispenses with all the note value notation and provides you with just the 'finger pathway' through the music you listen to or want to learn.

9,"How reliable are dogs when they are used in criminal cases? ; I would assume there is some sort of standard....ie a scientific tests of some sort to establish credibilty and reliablity....of both the dog, the handler and the trainer....but is that really an exact science?...wouldn't that allow for a great margin of error?\n\nI have seen dogs go both ways.....do poorly on a case....and ones that have ""found"" the intended target..or whatever the situation may be. I am not talking about drug sniffing dogs.\n\nTwo cases I am thinking of are the Jessica Lunsford(sp) case in FLA...where the dog didnt locate her body in the shallow grave.....and the Scott Peterson case...where the dog handler was allowed to testify( he(the dog..lol) sniffed at the end of the dock...denoting that she was in the water).\n\n\nShould dogs be allowed to be used(sniffing) in criminal cases? Not as a tool or method for law enforcement but should they be able to ""testify"" in court....and of course I don't mean the dog  but the handler re: testimony? ; The actual use of a dog is quite exact. The problem you run into are the training techniques and the fact that certain dogs (and handlers) should not pass the training certs they are required to. Many of the 'good dogs' are almost 100% right and even when they alert, and there is nothing there, there HAS been something there in the past. For example drug and 'people' dogs, those used to find illegal aliens on the border. Many times they will alert to an area and no one or no dope is found. If the dog is good, then you can practically guaruntee that there was something there in the past. Also take for example that bloodhounds are the only dog that can be used for a track and their nose is the only one you can make a warrantless entry. Yet the bloodhounds I worked with couldnt find a bisquit.\nRef testimony: if the dog has an excellent history, I believe that what they alert to should be used in court. Obviously not as the only thing, but is an extremely good indication that something was illegal, there, not right etc. If the dog has a record of mis-alerts then I believe that the 'testimony' of the dog should not be used. Once again, here lies the problem. Its difficult to prove when a dog is mediocre as his failures are rarely reported on, only his successes.",5027

I remember watching the movie I am asking about and I know it wasn't a nightmare movie he was real in this movie the whole time.

2,"nervious breakdowns how the brain works afterward? ; does the brain switch off from time to time and we just dont know what we are doing or feel any pain when we are hurt? ; In the Middle Ages, it was called melancholia. In the early 1900s, it was known as neurasthenia. From the 1930s to about 1970, it was known as a nervous breakdown. ""Nervous breakdown"" is a term that the public uses to characterize a range of mental illnesses, but generally it describes the experience of ""snapping"" under immense pressure, mental collapse or mental and physical exhaustion. \n""Nervous breakdown"" is not a clinical term. There is no psychiatric definition of a nervous breakdown, and it has nothing to do with nerves. ""Nervous breakdown"" is an inexact and unscientific term that is no longer used in psychiatry. Much as modern medicine breaks down diseases into more specific definitions (not just ""cancer,"" but ""stage 1 ovarian cancer""), modern psychiatry is breaking the term ""nervous breakdown"" into more precise diagnoses. \n\nThe diagnosis that most closely resembles what the public calls a nervous breakdown is major depression. Depressive episodes may be caused by genetic and biological factors and are often triggered by social and environmental circumstances. Depression is defined as the ""loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities"" and ""sustained fatigue without physical exertion."" Depression is characterized by a lack of energy and motivation along with feelings of guilt or hopelessness.

I'm still not over my ex and that was 7 years ago.  I know that doesn't sound promising, but that isn't what life is about.  You learn to deal.  As time goes by it gets easier.  If you really love someone they will always hold a special place in your heart, even 50 years down the road.  Don't try to get over it.  Cry, listen to sad music, wear pj pants, and eat ice cream.

Joe takes the stuff out of the basket, one by one. He takes out the sodas and realizes that they forgot to bring a bottle opener. Joe & Steve beg Poncho to turn back home and retrieve it, but Poncho flatly refuses, knowing that they'll eat everything by the time he gets back. \n\nSomehow, after about two hours, the turtles manage to convince Poncho to go, swearing on their great-grand turtles' graves that they won't touch the food.

However, the Microsoft crowd is gravitating to .net, a language-neutral library of code that can do everything Windows is capable of.\n\nYou would have to gain familiarity with DirectX which seems to be the engine behind the software. You have to write the bridge between DirectX, the widget showing the preview image and then get DirectX to compose the .avi file out to the hard drive.\n\nIf it were me, I'd be more inclined to program it in Java using NetBeans so we aren't limited to just Windows.\n\nMy guess is a year if we programmed it as a one-man show and we have a steep learning curve to accomplish .avi.

If the EM wave can pass through very easily, the material has a low extinction coefficient.

These are some steps to take along the way.  First, work with experienced and trustworthy tutors to learn swim techniques.  Ask several coaches to watch you swim and accept their corrections and suggestions. Practice what works for you and discard what doesn't.  If possible, select one coach to encourage you, time you, spur you on.  Second, borrow books from the library about swimming, watch video tapes, and you will discover a lot.  Read Total Immersion material. You will be fascinated with your reading.  Also, research your topic on line to find articles about backstroke and freestyle.   Third, working your fast twitch muscles will help you improve time.  As you improve in technique, then -- and only then --practice harder and faster swims each time you get in the water.  Watch the clock and try to improve each week.  Most importantly, have patience with yourself and be less self-critical.  Let go of negative thoughts and stay positive.  A great deal of swimming is mental activity so stay positive.    As you practice new techniques to improve your strokes, you will find yourself improving, getting a better feel for the water.

9,"Should Incest be Legalized? ; This one is for all of the fans of gay-marriage.\n\nShould incest between consenting adults who can no longer bear children be legal?  Why or why not? ; Rene underscores the point Bananaman is trying to make here. She finds incest ""disgusting"" and uses that as an argument to support the illegality of incestuous relationships.  What ""disgusts"" one person may not another and thus it can be seen as somewhat hypocritical to support gay marriage but not incestuous marriage which many also find disgusting.\n\nRemember “disgusting” just means tending to repel or sicken people and many supporters of gay marriage are at least somewhat disgusted by many of the sexual acts homosexual couples must engage in (for obvious reasons).  They support gay marriage out of a belief for personal liberty which I find admirable.  But like Bananaman points out, why not extend the same personal liberties for incestuous couples?\n\nChicagoParty points out a better reason in that major birth defects can result from genetic deficiencies caused by intrafamilial intercourse. I personally, like many others, think that it’s unfair to handicap your children in such a profound way.  \n\nBut Banana is making a valid point.\n\n---\n\nOn another note the way we are progressing socially I wouldn't be surprised if incest loses some of it's social sting in the next 30-50 years. I don't think it's something to get worked up over. In the end social deviancy has always existed and accepting it culturally isn’t going to change how I live my life.\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus",5137

0,"who was first in the land of israel; arabic or jewish people or other? ; I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land and actually how the whole thing started   were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left? Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now? ; >>>>I'm just curious who was historically the first on the land….\n\nThe trouble is that the question makes no sense. Both historically and mythologically the Jews were Arabs. They aren’t a different people, they are simply a different religious sect. Prior to the rise of Islam around 1500 years ago the Middle East and North Africa was home to thousands of different religions, and one of those religions was Judaism. The different sects were in a state of near perpetual war with their neighbours as well as with the great powers like Babylon and Egypt.\n\nFrom a purely historical perspective it seems that one of the numerous religious sects living in Palestine gained the upper hand, either through theocratic means or through warfare or a combination of the two. Gradually they absorbed all the other people of that region and formed the state of Israel.\n\nBear in mind also that even at the time of Christ present day Israel wasn’t entirely Jewish occupied or controlled. Much of it was in Samaria, the Samaritans being a Hebrew but not Jewish sect that didn’t accept the absolute sanctity of the temple.\n\nSo as you can see it’s not a simple case of saying the Arabs or Jews were there first. Historically Jews are Arabs and Jews never historically occupied all of what is now Israel.\n\n>>>> were the jews exiled or chased out or volunteerily left?\n\nA little from column A, a little from column B.\n\nRemember how at the time of Jesus Israel had been occupied by the Romans?  Needless to say the Jews didn’t like that, and the situation was further aggravated by the Romans doing various stupid and offensive things. Eventually the people of Jerusalem and much of Judeaea got fed up and rebelled. A lot of Romans were killed, a lot more Jews were killed, a lot of Jews killed themselves rather than be captured. \n\nThe Romans ascribed the unrest to a religious source and decided that enough was enough and The Temple was torn down. \n\nWithout the temple to sacrifice at the Jews had no strong reason to cling to Israel, and combined with Roman persecution they mostly decided to leave in several waves over the next few hundred years.\n\nSo you could say that it was a voluntary Exodus, but it was just as much a refugee movement.\n\n>>>>Why did the international community choose the land in dispute now?\n\nBasically because\n\n1)It is the traditional Jewish homeland and a lot of Jews wanted it back.\n2)Jews had a lot of political clout in Washington after the war.\n3) Jews had been regularly slaughtered in Europe over the last 2000 years, and the recent Nazi holocaust was by far the worst example. A lot of people tjought that it would be a good idea not let it keep happening, and decided the best way to do that would be to give the Jews their own country outside Europe.\n\nCombine those three factors and you see a simple solution to all problems/ The fact that Palestine was a British colony/protectorate at the time and Britain wanted to offload all its colonies as fast as possible helped no end.\n\nBenji Man  wrote:\n>>>>>Africa is the cradle of civ so I will go with an early nomadic african people.\n\nAfrica is not the cradle of civilisation.

5,"Just Heard The Frank Thomas And The Blue Jays Are Very Close To A Two Year Deal.? ; The A's are giving up a lot of HR's and RBI's.  If the A's lose Zito and Thomas, what is in their future? ; Although Thomas is past his prime, this is still a huge upgrade for the Jays.  After having to play guys like Shea Hillenbrand and Gregg Zaun in the DH spot last year, having a guy who gets on base and hits for power like Thomas will give them an actual threat at the DH spot.  It also sounds like a big raise for the Big Hurt, since the Jays seem to be offering somewhere in the neighborhood of $7-8m per year.\n\nThe A's don't have the depth they did in their system a few years ago, but that will change soon enough if their guys from the 2005 draft pan out - they had 5 of the first 101 choices in that draft.  They've got some young arms in Casilla, Komine and Italiano, but I don't think they'll be in the majors for a couple of years.  Losing Zito will hurt, but they've still got a good staff nucleus with Harden, Blanton and Haren, with a couple of candidates for the 4-5 spots in the rotation.\n\nI think scoring runs will be the bigger challenge.  The A's ranked in the middle of the pack in runs last season, and Thomas' absence means someone else will have to be move into that DH role, or Beane will have to find another guy on the cheap like he did with Thomas.  Or, he could match the Jays' offer and keep Thomas in Oakland.\n\nEither way, I'm not counting Beane and the A's out just yet.  Many people thought they'd fall apart once they lost Mulder and Hudson, but they keep contending.",5172

People who live in areas of the world that only get sun for limited times during the day or year can sometimes experience the symptoms year round.

1,"Can an antibiotic act as an antibody? ; I'm trying to answer this question comparing the disk diffusion method and animal model.  If a disk diffusion method does not show any signs of zone inhibition but the animal model does recovery from the infection, what would be the causes? ; No, antibiotics are compounds that inhibit the growth of or kill bacteria whereas antibodies are produced by the body's immune system to bind to a specific epitope such as the glycopeptides on some bacterial surfaces. Once bound, they can trigger other immune responses to kill the invading bacteria.\nThe problem with the disk diffusion method of antibiotic susceptibility testing is that it can't be a true representative of what goes on in vivo in your animal model. The test gives the bacteria ideal growth conditions with the addition of the antibiotic, but there are many more factors to take into account in the animal model. Antibodies are a good example as they will help the immune system attack the bacteria. The addition of the antibiotic in the animal probably helps keep the numbers of the bacteria down while its building an immune response to clear the infection.",5216

The reason that there are still other apes is that they and we had a common ancestor several million years ago.  Chimpanzees, for example, have evolved just as much in the intervening time as we have - Biologists do not say that chimps or monkeys we see today are our ancestors, as is sometimes mistakenly claimed.\n\nHence the ""why are there still apes?"" question is invalid, and due to a misunderstanding of evolution.\n\nAgreed? ; Yep.

Try drinking a few glasses of water. Don't drink too much, but a couple of bottles of water should be fine. If your urine becomes lighter, then it's probable that you simply didn't have enough clear fluid in your system.\n\nIf the urine remains dark amber, and/or if you have other symptoms, like pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, pain or tightness in your stomach, aches in your back where your kidneys are located, etc., you should see a doctor.\n\nDark amber urine may also mean you have some blood in your urine.

One was appointing a man who has had problems with honesty in the past and the second is taking off the Congressional oversight intelligence committe a highly qualified woman and putting on a man who was fired as a judge for giving police information to criminals.  Could she have had severe menstrual symptoms that caused her to make these decisions.  I don't have a big problem with that just get a little fussy but no major cramps, dissiness etc.  My mom usually gives me more space during those times and is understanding.  The difference is Im not making major policy decisions effecting our country. ; Huff HUFF HUFF! What do you mean you did not get one answer?  I gave you a most excellent answer, enlightened and to the point, and best of all, made in USA.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS AN ANSWER:\n\nI think this, ahem, natural process can make women really crabby, and all you'd need is to have Nancy Pelosi doubled over in knots and then give her the slightest provocation and she'd go off like Michael Richards.  This could be a real problem if we had a woman president because all North Korea would have to do is to fire off a missile and if it happened to be that time of the month for her then she'd just up and nuke them. This is why I think that if we had a woman president there would be a new war every month.  She might be going through menopause which could mean the end of life on earth as we know it and might explain all her bad decisions.\n\nTHE PRECEDING WAS AN ANSWER.",5277

2,"Anabolic steroids injection -- do I have an infection or abscess? ; Four days ago I injected a dose of Sustanon, an anabolic steroid, into my left glute.  (I used a sterile needle/syringe and swabbed the injection area with alcohold rubs before and after.)  Today for the first time I noticed soreness around the injection area and moving toward my lower back.  I'm puzzled why I did not experience soreness before today, and I'm concerned that I may have an infection or abscess.  How do I tell and what are the treatment options? ; I probably shouldn't be advising you about this, but anyway....... Steroids are oil-based, so they will often form a lump when injected (especially if you use the same location all the time). Switch cheeks next time & your lump should go away in a week.\n\nMost importantly though, don't use anabolic steroids. There's no point in attracting girls if you can't do anything with them.

Not sure. ; The only thing I can think of that would be style related and not the store would be the Navy Pea Coats.\n\nPea Coat\nSailors who have to endure pea-soup weather often don their pea coats but the coat's name isn't derived from the weather. The heavy topcoat worn in cold, miserable weather by seafaring men was once tailored from pilot cloth — a heavy, course, stout kind of twilled blue cloth with the nap on one side. The cloth was sometimes called P-cloth for the initial letter of ""pilot"" and the garment made from it was called a p-jacket — later, a pea coat. The term has been used since 1723 to denote coats made from that cloth.",5287

That is God (the Father), Jesus (the Son), and the Holy Spirit.  They are all the same being.  It is very difficult to comprehend, at least with our human mind.  The Bible talks about the three of them separately so many times it almost seems as they are different, but they are truly one.\n\nThe easiest way it was explained to me for comprehension was this:  Think about who you are...for example, let's say you are a mother, a daughter, and an office manager.  You are all three of those things, but you are one person.  \n\nThere is a lot more to it, but they are all the same with different traits and do different things for us.

As for convincing him to stop, the answer is different for everyone. He will need to want to stop for himself, first, for this is the only effective reason. I went to a councelor about it, and that helped me incredibly.

I was in track and the coach always had us running up bleachers, the church steps (there were 120 steps), and he used the parachute or the ortho ban ( a giant rubber band that ortho uses for knees and ankles), or a make shift. BO Jackson and some of the other football players and the worlds fastes man and women run up steep hills and the parachute method. I am training my daughter for track and I use the hill and the parachute method. All it is is stamina. AND your mind. \n                Have you been giving your body plenty of rest? Without rest it won't really matter how intense the training. You'll only defeat the purpose. When you do a set with weights you need to allow your body 1 whole minute to regain oxygen and supply it to the torn down muscles. When you run you need to mix up the speed. Airbourn shuffle at the beginning then gradually work it up then back down to the Airbourn Shuffle again. Then the next work out you work it backwards. It gives your body a shock an da variety. But again you need to get plenty of rest. How are you eating? That is a diet that you need to see a dietricionist for. ADVICE; Don't do the Adkins diet for runners and track people. It takes away the water intake and you dehydrate the body. Matter of fact I think that diet should be banned. \n                 Other than that you need to experiment with yourself and see what works for your body and what doesn't.

As Vice-President at the time of the assination Johnson had much to gain with the death of Kennedy. It was also under wide speculation during that time that Kennedy was planning to drop Johnson during the next election because he was a liability. Also, prior to Kennedy's death Johnson was the subject of four major criminal investigations involving government contract violations, misappropriation of funds, money laundering and bribery.

3,"When do I use a comma just before and? ; When do I use a comma just before and? :( ; Actually, you don't need the comma before the ""and"" if you are writing a list like ""sausage, pepperoni and onions.""  However, many teachers still disagree on this, so honestly if you're writing a school paper, you should ask your teacher what to do.  And next year, ask your new teacher the same question.\n\nYou do need the comma+and combination when you are connecting two different clauses in the same sentence.  A ""clause"" works like a sentence by itself, becuase it has a noun and a verb.  However some clauses don't make sense by themselves, for example ""and he is also very handsome.""  Those are called ""dependent clauses"" because they only work as part of a larger sentence.\n\nExamples of the comma+and usage:\n\n""My boyfriend is smart, and he is also very handsome.""\n""I met a woman at the grocery store today, and she told me where to find a good dentist.""\n""Shakira began writing her own music when she was 8 years old, and she has been recording albums with Sony since she was 13.""",5472

After Mitosis, how many chromosomes will the new skin cell have? ??\nthanks ; Human cells have 46 chromosomes. To ensure that each daughter cell receives one and only one of each chromosome, eukaryotic cells undergo a complex, multistep process called mitosis. Before mitosis can begin, eukaryotes must first replicate their DNA. This process is similar to but takes much longer than DNA replication in prokaryotes. Then, during mitosis, the replicated chromosomes line up along the center line of the cell. Tiny fibers, called spindle fibers, attach to the individual chromosomes and pull them apart, toward opposite poles of the cell, where they remain until the cell divides.\n\nLong story short, the new skin cell will still have 46 chromosomes.",5477

He told me, ""If you'll stay hatefull and unforgiving you won't be the same person anymore, because as simple as hating someone or something takes everything out of you making you harshes and meaner to the world around you. When someone spends a long time hating, they might loose the grip with the reality and what's important to them... and in the end they might never be able to come back to the way they used to be: sweet, kind, and forgiving"" ... I knew what he meant when he told me that, I just personally had a hard time to doing that since I had my own private reasons for the hate, revenge and being mean. I thought I had every good God-given reason to stay that way without even thinking of consequences. In my thinking, I thought, ""Why on this God-green-Earth I should even consider to forgive a guy (of all people!) who raped me when I was little?! Why can't anyone see what I mean?"" In truth, my Husband was the only and the first person to open-up my eyes to everything. He was able to understand and see everything the way it was needed to assist me in recovery through this whole mess. He helped me and guided me to the firmer ground knowing fully well that it'll take probably a long time for me to come back to ""normal"" or at least to the way I wish I was...\n\nYou know, one day was an eye-oppener for me... In the evening, before going to bed, when I was washing my face, I took a glimpse in the mirror... I thought I'll scream... I didn't expect to see the face that was looking back at me. I knew it was me, but I just couldn't recognise myself... no anymore, at least. I've spent so many months and years hating someone I didn't quite remember and for what they've done that every possible negative emotion that I could possibly have... I could see it as plain as daylight written on my face. I looked cold, harsh, mean and completely uncaring towards anything or anyone. It was something I didn't expect and I hope will never see. I never thought that all the negative emotions will change me so drastically and deteriorate the way I looked on the outside... He didn't see anything on my face even though I was afraid to ask. I thought I'd give him a heart attack not only with that question but also acting like a scared cat... That night, being in my Husband's arms it felt so safe (just like always), but for some reason it dawned on me that maybe I didn't deserve him in any way because of the what was going on and how everything turned out to be. Remembering and knowing in my heart that he loved me, that he'll always be here no matter what and he'll never judge, criticise, ignore or leave me in any way, shape, or form... It has made all the difference in the world to me. That same night I just thought to myself, ""Whoever you are I forgive you with all of my heart and soul for what you have done, and I sencirely hope you'll never do something like this ever again to anyone else."" I meant every word... I don't know why but I felt so light, as if a big weight and burden was lifted off of my shoulders. That night was one of the most peaceful and restfull nights I've had in a long time. My heart didn't feel like it had to work over-time just to calm me down and my whole being started to heal. It took me about 2 months to start and heal if not completely, but at least be on the way to recovery. I know, there wll still be moments when I'll remember the past as if it only happened yesterday. It'll be just that a memory of that day and nothing more. Forgiving him actually took out the sting from the event and was like a healling herb that my heart and soul needed so ba",5504

3,"what are the guide of supplication pls answer me now i need a assignment pls..? ; pls help me plsss.... ; Supplication (also known as petitioning) is the most common form of prayer, wherein a person asks a supernatural deity to provide something, either for the person who is praying or for someone else on whose behalf a prayer of supplication is being made.\n\nIn Christianity, the prayer of supplication for health by and on behalf of the sick is referenced in early Christian writings in the New Testament, especially James 5:13-16. One example of supplication is the Catholic ritual of novena (from novem, the Latin word for ""nine"") wherein one repeatedly asks for the same favor over a period of nine days. This ritual began in France and Spain during the Middle Ages when a nine day period of hymns and prayers led up to a Christmas feast, a period which ended with gift giving. A contemporary Christian example of supplication is the practice of the Daily Prayer for Peace by the Community of Christ where a member prays for peace each day at a specified time.\n\nIn Islam, the Arabic word duˤā (plural adˤiya) is used to refer to supplications. Adˤiya may be made in any language, although there are many traditional Islamic supplications in Arabic, Persian and Turkish. In Islam, duˤā tends to mean personal prayer. Muslim prayer beads usually have 33 or 99 beads to represent God's many names.\n\nThe concept is perfectly at home with secular use. The supplicant may also be described as a suppliant but the former word is more commonly used. The key meaning is of a request by the lesser person in an acknowledged unequal relationship",5511

This ""chrisma"" is given to us at the time we're saved to show we're approved priests.  This annointing includes the giving of spiritual gifts.

It is really unknown what our time is capable of doing. But if we are able to go back in time, it will be a big mistake. A time parodox will happen, and that is not good at all. Say your Mom gets in a wreck and dies, so you build a time machine so that you can go back in time and save her. Well, if you do go back in time and save her, then you would have never had to have built the time machine to save her. She would have never died, so you would not spend your time building the time machine. But if you never had built the time machine then she would have died. If she died, you would have built the time machine to save her, and if you saved her, you would have never had to build the time machine. Thus, a time parodox. Another scenerio, which is broght up in the short story ""A Sound of Thunder"", is that if you go back in time to the age of the Dinosaurs and step on a bug, then all of those bugs children will never be born (and a few billion years down the road, that will be a HUGE decrease in that bug population. If there is a big decrease in that population, then a lot of the animals that survive off of those bugs will die. If those larger animals die, then the animals that eat those animals will die. Eventually, there is not going to be much life on Earth. Either that, or the species will evolve to try to adapt to the decrease in the animal population. They might resort to eating plants. If all of the animals eat only plants, most of the forests would be destroyed, if the forests are destroyed, then there will be less oxygen, then all the animals will die and maybe a new species will arise that can survive in a oxygen lacking environment. See all of the things that can happen if you step on a bug. So if a scientist comes up to you and says ""Do you want to travel back in time?"" Say yes, go over to the machine and either pee on it or hit it with a sledge hammer to destroy it. Then tell them to never build a time machine because you could mess up the Earth.",5545

Our ability to allow for another opinion, even one we disagree with and do everything we can to oppose, has always made us strong.

We are now getting to the idea that only one way is the right way and to even THINK otherwise is evil.\n\nThis is showing in the lawsuits (where I WILL agree we need laws limiting them - and none too soon).

Anyone can help me with this, about 200 words because I have only few minutes to talk about this. Thank you very much. ; Try to download the free Visual C# Express 2005 from Microsoft and also check the online documentation of MSDN. \n\nThese are the excerpt from the documentation:\n\n""C# Language\nC# syntax is highly expressive, yet with less than 90 keywords, it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin working productively in C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ while providing powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, anonymous methods and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# also supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code.\n\nAs an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.\n\nIn addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# facilitates the development of software components through several innovative language constructs, including:\n\nEncapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.\n\nProperties, which serve as accessors for private member variables. \n\nAttributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time. \n\nInline XML documentation comments.\n\nIf you need to interact with other Windows software such as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs, you can do this in C# through a process called ""Interop.""

9,"was custer a hero or was he a dam fool that got himself and all his men killed? ; General custer of the 7th calvery ; Saturday, June 25, 2005\nGeneral Custer-My Perspective \n\nToday is the 129 anniversary of what us whites call Custer's Last Stand or the Little Big Horn. The Lakota, Ogalla, And Cheyenne call Gressy Grass. There are several reasons that this is important and I will get into it later.\n\nFirst of all the Rank at the time of Gressy Grass was Lt. Colonel, but due to his brevetted Rank in the Civil War was Major General. So if a person were to address him it would be General. It is the same as we refer to President Reagan after he left office, becaue he earned the title. The only way he would have lost the right to be called General is if he was demoted due to an infraction of military law. At the time he was posted here at Fort Lincoln Southwest of Bismarck, Dakota Territory was the need for generals was not as great.\n\nDuring the Civil War he was considered the North premiere Calvary General were he perfected dividing his force and strategy that generations of historians would pan him for the last four decades.\n\nFirst off, General Custer was arrogant, or maybe just overconfident. Although is it really arrogance when you can do what you think you can.\nIf he were as bad a character that the modern day historian claim he was.\n(There is a theory that Reno and Benteen set him up to fail.)\n\nHis orders were vague, he and the seventh Calvary was supposed to meet up with General Terry sometime. He was offered gattlin guns. Some historians think that this might have saved him. There are three problems with this the terrain is incredibly hilly with a lot of coolies making it hard to get them set up. A gattlin gun weighed over a ton and would slow down a Calvary unit (the Calvary Unit of the 19th century were considered to be akin to our special forces today. The Calvary units were quick attack units. Third, black powder had a tendency to jam regularly. I wouldn't have wanted them.\n\nI think that he found the village to soon. The rule of thumb if you could see an indian They KNEW you were there. I will grant you that he didn't listen to his scouts, but the number of warriors in the village I don't think anyone would have comprehended. There is a possibility that he was going to fight a holding action. Trying to hold out tell the three columns of Sheridan and the other Generals. Sheridan and the other two Generals were held up they weren't where they were late because they encountered other Nations on the way.\n\nThe morning of the battle Custer divided his command of about 100 troopers into three commands under Reno and Benteen. (Later in Reno's military career his was court martialed for assaulting his commanding officers daughter). This was so they could surround the village. The last order out from Custer was for Benteen to ""bring packs big village."" He didn't. Reno was surrounded for a time but when one of his sergeants brains were blown out Reno took off running.\n\nHere is the victor's perspective. Months before the Battle Sitting Bull had a vision of soldiers falling into the village. The interesting part of the vision for me was the warning not to take anything from the soldiers or they would loose the war. His warning was headed. (Kinda harkens back to Joshua and the fall of Jericho when he warned them not to take anything, but Achan did and they lost the next battle Joshua 6-7 Makes me ponder what would have happened if the Nations would have heeded the warning).\n\nCrazy Horse was a very formidable General. The terrain really lent a hand to the way the Lakota, Ogalla, and Cheyenne fought. It gave the warriors a lot of cover. The yellow boy Winchester 10 round magazine repeating rifle for close quarter fighting is very formidable against a single shot Spencer carbine. Not including recurve bows. The warriors were trained from an early age to fight one-on-one. The stiff formations of the Calvary didn't work well because the Warrior fought outside of the box.\n\nThe importance o",5659

1,"number of chromatids per chromosome during cell cycle? ; I need to know how many chromatids per chromosome there are for the stages G1, S, G2, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nI think its \nG1=1, \nS=2, \nG2=2, \nprophase=2, \nmetaphase=2,\nanaphase=1\ntelophase=2\n\nAm I correct in my thinking or do I have the whole thing messed up or just some of it? ; In G1, there are 46 chromosomes, EACH CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHROMATID.  You will have two copies of chromosome one (one from mom, the other from dad), two copies of chromosome two, etc.  These pairs are called homologues.  Consequently there are 23 homologous chromosomes in G1 and, again, there is one chromatid per chromosome in this phase.  This gives a total of 46 chromosomes.  You should know that each chromosome is decondensed (not coiled up) at this time. \n\nS phase is the synthesis or replication phase of the cell cycle.  After S phase is complete, the definition of a chromosome changes.  It is now a ""replicated chromosome"" that consists of 2 chromatids (some texts describe these as ""sister chromatids"").  Again, the total number of chromosomes is 46; however, because of the definition change of the S-phase chromosome, each chromosome how includes twice as much DNA due to replication.  After S phase there are two chromatids per chromosome.  These chromosomes are decondensed.\n\nIn G2, there are 46 chromosomes:  2 chromatids per chromosome, decondensed, with the chromosomes existing in homologous pairs.\n\nIn prophase of mitosis, the chromosomes condense to facilitate easy separation into the daughter cells.  Here there are still 2 chromatids per chromosome.\n\nIn metaphase, there are STILL 2 chromatids per chromosome, all smartly arranged at the ""equator"" of the cell, the metaphase plate.\n\nIn anaphase, the replicated chromosomes (i.e., the ""sister chromatids"") are pulled apart.  At the point that they are separated, the definition of a chromosome changes AGAIN, BACK to a single chromatid.  Each daughter cell will receive 46 of these single chromatids and, therefore, will have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs.  The chromosomes are still condensed at this point.\n\nIn telophase, the chromosome situation is exactly the same.  23 homologous PAIRS of chromosomes (46 single chromatids).  The difference here is that the chromosomes are now decondensing.\n\nSummary:  the number of chromatids per chromosome\n\nG1-1\nafter S- 2\nG2-2\nprophase-2\nmetaphase-2\nlate anaphase-1\ntelophase-1",5666

You didn't say how the ex feels about you. Why does she deny him seeing his child? Because I do not know if my answer will help if you don't have the same life I had. The ex hated me and didn't mind telling everyone she knew. She thought I was the root of their separation. I didn't even know my now husband at the time they 1st broke up. I had been going with him for about 5 months when I found out that he wasn't DIVORCED! So for that reason she used us being together as what was wrong with their relationship. She told everyone that Mike drank all the time and that she didn't trust him being alone with his son. When really it was a way to punch him for leaving her. The reason for not getting a divorce right away, he didn't want them to cancell their medical insurance. Dumb then...we played her game for many months. Then I started checking things out. He could get the divorce, keep insurance on his kid, pay child support (a must) and the court would let him have his son every other weekend. If she didn't produce the child..She could go to jail. So Check it out where you leave. Your man may want to make the divorce legal...Now to the other part of your question..Why does she have to be there..Just to piss you off more than likely. She will dress up and look great. As if to say..see what you are missing. Have him get a divorce..then the ball is back in your court. Only never be late on one child support payment..or you guess it..she would have him in jail..Again just to piss you off. Don't let her get you down. But, make him make a choice and get a divorce..or get the hell out now why you can.",5678

Remember your first impression counts, so dress for an interview even when picking up apps.

It does not need to be very elaborate, but with a simple word processor, there is no reason you can't create one pretty easily. Take a couple of copies when you gather and return applications and if you get asked to an interview. If you have never held a job before, you can list volunteer work, pertinent after school activities and self employment such as lawn mowing or baby sitting. Under education, list the school you are attending and any awards or achievements you have obtained.\n- Make sure you have written down all the answers you will need for a application. Some places will want you to complete the application on the spot. You should have addresses, employment dates, emergency contact information etc.\n- Ask your parents, a teacher or other adult you trust to look over your resume and to help you practice for interviews.\n\nRemember, job hunting is a job.

But which is the true answer and how can you prove it? ; This is the story as is told to all Greek children, and written down, and there is no number of seeds mentioned, only that either the fruit or it's seeds was eaten.\n\nThe beautiful daughter of Demeter and Zeus, Persephone is the focus of the story resulting in the division of the seasons, giving us the sweetness of Spring and the bitterness of Winter. Hades did not woo the beautiful Persephone, he abducted her and took her to his underground kingdom. After much protest, Persephone came to love the cold blooded king of the underworld but her mother, Demeter, was consumed with rage and sorrow. She demonstrated her anger by punishing the earth’s inhabitants with bitter cold and blustering winds. Unless Persephone was returned to her mother’s side, the earth would perish.\n\nHermes was sent to the house of Hades by Zeus to reason with Hades. He entered the kingdom of Hades and negotiated a compromise between the (usually cold and selfish) Hades and the (usually loving and caring) Demeter. Before Persephone could leave the underworld, Hades gave her a pomegranate seed to eat. By doing this he bound her to himself and his kingdom. When Demeter found out about the trickery she was angry but she was also resigned that there was nothing she could do... her loving daughter was bound to the Lord of the Dead. With no alternative, it was agreed that Persephone would to spend part of the year with her husband, Hades, and part of the year in the sunlight with her mother, Demeter.\n\nWhen Persephone is with Hades the earth is wracked by the sorrow of her mother. But, when Persephone returns from the underworld to walk the earth again, Demeter pours forth the blessings of Spring to welcome her beloved daughter home.",5799

It will, however, be radically reshaped by God's creative fire into a planet, or world, much different than it is presently. \n\nJesus' disciples asked him in the Olivet discourse to tell them when the end of the world would come. Actually, they asked: when will be the end of the age? The question involved the end of human history as it had been known to that point. That age about which they questioned the Lord is still going on in our time. \n\nJesus answered by giving a list of prophetic signs that will precede His Second Coming. Christ indicated that the world, as it was then known, and is now known, would end when He returned. Revelation tells us that Jesus' Millennial Kingdom will be the next ""earth age."" \n\nIt will last 1000 years, after which time the Great White Throne judgment will take place, where all lost people of all ages will be judged and sentenced to eternity apart from God. Hell is their final place of residence, from which there will be no escape. \n\nPlanet Earth will then be remade into something more glorious than can be imagined or described by the humanmind, this side of Heaven. Peter, the apostle, through Divine inspiration of the Holy Spirit, gives us just a glimpse of Earth's ultimate destiny: \n\n""But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat? Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.""(2 Peter 3: 10-13) God's Word promises: \n\n""One generation passes away, and another generation comes; But the earth abides forever."" (Ecclesiastes 1:4) ; well the bible says no man knows the day or the hour.  but you will know the season.  that to me says we may verywell be able to narrow it down to within a few months of when christs second coming will happen.  century score decade year season month and week all come before day and hour we may be even able to tell the WEEK of his coming. the bible say we will know the season.  not we MAY know it says we WILL know. maybe that can be taken literally.\n I can say biblically it must happen between now and the year 2018\n\nthe bible says the generation that sees israel reborn as a nation shall not pass before the second coming israel was reborn as a nation in 1946 the bible defines a generation as 72 years therefore. do the math.\n\nWE ARE IN THE END TIMES PEOPLE!\n\nknow this the US MUST TURN AND COME AGAINST ISRAEL TO FULFILL BIBLICAL PROPHESY.  the bible says ALL NATIONS OF THE WORLD will come against israel\n\nwhen will the world end.

It's yahweh, you slide the vowels into each letter including the W.\n\nThose who are qouting jehovah from the O.T. are using an incorrect translation. The KJV is a horrible translation  that is nowhere near the greek of the Bible. ; In the Hebrew OT, YHWH (still to close to the name of God for Hebrews to feel safe) was frequently replaced with Adonai - Hebrew for ""Lord."" (which is why the Greek NT uses Kurios - ""Lord"").  Your 13th Century monk used the vowled from Adonai with YHWH to form YaHoWaH - but in Ecclesiastical Latin 'J' and 'W' did not exist, so it became Jaehovah.\n\nMajor literary works, like the KJV, do as much to create language as to use the existing language.  So now, in English, Jehovah is the word for the name of God; in Hebrew it's YHWH.

Bush's ""Sanctity of Marriage"" gay marriage constitutional ban. \nGeorge W. Bush's marital problems have just taken another turn for the worse. Apparently, Mr. Bush has not only engaged in an extra-marital affair with a member of the opposite sex who is also a senior member of his Cabinet, but also a member of the same sex. WMR received the following  release this morning from Leola McConnell, Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada (who has been endorsed by WMR). McConnell is a one-time professional dominatrix.\n""President Bush's speech to the nation Monday. If he doesn't say he's a gay American or at the least a bisexual one then he shouldn't be making one at all. And the notion that it would be in regards to writing bigotry into our nation's Constitution is reprehensible. Too bad it isn't me doing the rebuttal because in 1984, I watched him perform (with the enthusiasm of homosexual male who had done this many times before) a homosexual act on another man, namely Victor Ashe. Victor Ashe is the current Ambassador to the nation of Poland who should also come out like former Governor McGreevey of New Jersey and admit to being a gay American. Other homo-erotic acts were also performed by then private citizen George Bush because I performed one of them on him personally. \n\nI am the woman this website (bushssecretlifein84.tripod.com) speaks of that has been posted on the net nearly two years now. None of this would be the business of anyone but President Bush's little ruse to save his failed presidency by using DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] to divide Americans one from the other has to be exposed as the act of a desperate closeted homosexual man. The only crime in being GLBT is in the hiding. The President needs to come clean with the American people about his own past sexual behavior before he tries to besmirch the humanity of people in search of sincerely committing to the same bonds of matrimony he's afforded. He violated his own vows of monogamy having a homosexual affair with a long time family friend of whom his wife had no knowledge. His hypocrisy seems to know no bounds. \n\nI had planned to run for governor of Nevada without going into any of this but his planned nationally televised address to the nation makes it necessary for me to address his attempt at division in as public a way as he picked to try this Bushification of reality regarding same sex marriages.\n\nSincerely,\nLeola McConnell\nLiberal Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada\n --------------------------------------\nNow, aint this special!?",5819

Are there any other EKG techs that will share how much they earn. ; I'm not an EKG tech, but I am a theatrical-lighting technician. Your question raises some of the interesting points I've seen in my own line of work. It seems that it is possible to get a paycheck for doing something with redeeming value (monitoring peoples' health or legitimate theater, for example). However, I have found in my business that so-called ""corporate theater"" (awards shows for fat-cats, fashion shows, etc.) pays substantially better. These events are merely so the already wealthy can pat each-other on the back and feel good about themselves. From an artistic or social standpoint it's gross. However, that's where the money is.\n\nI think that your situation underlines the fact that the people who do the most good (and I'm not putting any sort of theater into that category) are rarely compensated well for their efforts. I think one need look no further than how teachers are paid to see that this is true.\n\nI'm sorry. What you do is important and requires a skill-set that very few people have. I think it's a shame that the people who work behind the scenes, making sure that the engines that allow us to feel safe and secure are not treated fairly.\n\nI hesitate to say that ""we've lost sight of what's really important,"" as I don't think it's ever been any different, but I think that now, in the twenty-first century we have the perspective to change the way this system works.\n\nGood luck.",5894

In 1968, the Sveriges Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) instituted the Prize in Economic Sciences in memory of Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prize. Each prize consists of a medal, personal diploma, and prize amount.\n\n  \nAlfred Nobel was born in 1833 in Stockholm, Sweden. His family was descended from Olof Rudbeck, the best-known technical genius of Sweden's 17th century era as a great power in northern Europe.  \nNobel invented dynamite in 1866 and later built up companies and laboratories in more than 20 countries all over the world.  \nOn November 27, 1895, Nobel signed his last will providing for the establishment of the Nobel Prize.

1,"How astronomer measure the distance between galaxies? ; If a galaxy is 50 million light years from earth, it means it takes 50 years for light to travel from the galaxy to earth. How astronomer knows the light from a galaxy is 50 million years old? ; By the red shifts of the measurement. Or to make a short story long it's the displacement of features in the spectra of astronomical objects, such as galaxies and quasars, towards the longer wavelengths, generally interpreted as a result of the Doppler effect due to their recessional velocities (i.e. how fast they're moving away from something) The expansion of the universe means that all but the nearest galaxies have redshifted spectra (in fact this is what led to the discovery of the expanding universe back in the 1920's). Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer. All that means is that by this redshift they were able to approximate the distance of these galaxies, and since they had these distances they could state them in light years (since light years is a distance, not necessarily a time)",5947

If that is true, what must have happened to the original rocks? ; I will answer first the easy one. The oldest rocks are found in the pacific plate, the ones near the marianes trench, but their age is not 4.6 bya. Because old rocks return inside the earth through subduction zones. \nRefer to rock cycle.\nNew rocks are produce at the MOR (mid-oceanic ridges) and old ones are consumed at the subduction zones.\nThere are no very old rocks in continental crusts because they were weathered and eroded and brought to seas through rivers.\nNow about fossils. Most fossils are found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks forms when sediments accumulates and cemented. Like lakes, and seas. Usually these place occur life. For example a leaf fall from a tree and left at the bottom of the river. Sediments pile over the leaf and thus preserved.\nIf lava piled over a life (like a leaf) the life or existence will burn and thus not preserved.\nFor fossil to occur it must be preserved.

I can try Rue Care Oil that not only treat the hemorrhoids but also helps to straighten the veins and can be used for this purpose after the surgery to help hemorrhoids from re-appearing. Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

9,"Felony Time Frame? ; How long does it take for a police report to go through and investigated and go to court if considered a felony. This is regarding a lost/forgotten purse at a store containing $2000 in and found it in posession of someone else and the money was missing. I know I first have to prove that there was $2000 in the purse. I don't know how they can prove there was that amount of money. No one actually saw them take the money. How long does the police have to investigate. ; There is no set timeframe for a police investigation - that having been said, police departments are anxious to ""clear"" cases that they're working on. Crime figures are reported, both to the public and the state, and police departments are notoriously reluctant to appear ""inefficent.""\n\nIt's also true that - as time elapses since the crime was committed - ""evidence"" and new information becomes harder to come by, so there is little point in ""investigating"" beyond a relatively short period of time.\n\nBut - if you mean is there a law as to when the police have to decide when to bring charges or drop a case - no. If a person is arrested for a crime, the state has a limited period of time in which to file charges - and there are statutes of limitation as to the maximum period of time, after a crime is alleged to have occurred, that legal proceedings based on those events may begin.\n\nThe sad reality is that the case is far more important to you than it is to your local police department - and in their defense, it's likely (unless you live in a very small town) that your incident is just one of many crimes that the department is dealing with. \n\nThe local state attorney will only bring charges if they feel like they have a reasonably strong chance of winning the case. If, as you have described it, it will be difficult for the prosecutor to prove that this particular suspect stole your money, it's highly likely that no charges will be brought. Unlike police television dramas, it's unlikely that the defendant will break down on the stand and admit to having stolen from your purse - either the police have evidence that makes a strong case - or they have a confession - or they have fairly unimpeachable eyewitnesses - or they have nothing.",5984

The argument for having aliens make up a portion of our workforce has always been that they are taking the jobs that others do not want.

""Cannon"" derives from the Latin canna—a tube. Bombard was earlier used for ""cannon"", but from the early 15th century came to refer only to the largest weapons.

5,"Where was the first baseball game played? And Who Invented It? ; Id really like to know because I am a big time baseball fan. ; The origins and evolution of the various bat-and-ball games are murky, and many believe that baseball is primarily an American invention. However, many believe that it originated as an adaptation of the game of rounders, and was also influenced by the rules of cricket. As far back as the 1870s, American newspapers were referring to baseball as ""The National Pastime"" or ""The National Game."" An award-winning account of the origins of the game is David Block's Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (University of Nebraska Press, 2005). The publisher's description of the book notes that ""David Block looks into the early history of the game and of the 150-year-old debate about its beginnings. He tackles one stubborn misconception after another, debunking the enduring belief that baseball descended from the English game of rounders and revealing a surprising new explanation for the most notorious myth of all—the Abner Doubleday–Cooperstown story."" In short, the debate on the game's origins may never be settled to everyone's satisfaction.",6006

8,"Okay. This is for anyone.? ; Okay. Everybody says I'm pretty, and I get prettier everyday, yadayadayada.  But, I can't except it. Like, I'm not confident in myself. How can I be more confident? ; You're young, right?  I know the feeling, and have it again as an old person.  It's like you cannot respect their judgment, or cannot believe they are telling the truth, when they say you are pretty.  You figure they must have lousy taste, or they want something and are just being flattering, etc.\n\nFact is, it doesn't matter very much what anyone else thinks of your looks compared to what you think when you look in the mirror.  Most young people, especially, exaggerate the importance of their worst feature, and minimize the importance of their best feature.  So, for example, you may have a really classically beautiful face, but you can't appreciate it because you are that dissatisfied with your hair or your figure.  Or the other way around.  If you think an objective view would help, try going to a professional photographer and getting your portrait done.  They see beautiful people all day long, and they also see people who are less than perfect, and know how to maximize the model's potential.\n\nNow go one step further.  Mix that photo with several gathered from the Internet (any that are in jpg format that you can copy with a right click) of people you think are prettier than you.  Create a ""poll"" for someone else (so as not to prejudice the answers) to ask several people to rank order the pictures.  My guess is you will come up higher on the ranking than you think you will, and specifically higher than several pictures you considered to be prettier than yourself.  That's because tastes differ, and you are not able to be objective about yourself.\n\nI know plenty of people will say ""believe in yourself,"" ""love yourself,"" etc.  This is my suggestion on how to gather more-or-less objective evidence for believing in yourself.",6098

In the Eighties, Madonna defined a new sound with her Single ""Holiday"".  In the Nineties, the Dance/Pop of Paula Abdul, Sheena Easton, Belinda Carlisle, Taylor Dayne and others lost it's commercial appeal and Commerial Dance Music morphed into what it is today:  the Urban influenced sounds of Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera.\n\nPersonally, I still like the DJ Remixes that went Commercial in the Nineties and are still going strong.

Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa, arguably the world's highest volcano and the highest freestanding mountain in the world. It also takes its place as one of the 'Seven Summits', a holy grail for climbers consisting of the highest peaks in each of the seven continents. \n\nFrom second source:  Africa's tallest mountain (der höchste Berg Afrikas) was long thought to be nothing but a legend. After all, how could there be a snow-capped peak just three degrees south of the equator? But German-speaking explorers were the first Europeans to ever see and climb Kilimanjaro—and establish the mountain's existence.\nKilimanjaro is also the world's highest mountain that can be climbed by hiking (walking), but the lower, more jagged Mawensi volcanic peak (17,564 ft) was not climbed until 1912 and requires mountaineering experience.",6117

Find sine, cosine and tangent of the triangle (containing point P on the terminal side). \n\n**I guess my problem is I am not so sure exactly what the terminal side of the triangle is (my text book is dreadful) and my teacher basically is no help. I know how to get sine cosine and tangent once I know how to graph the triangle, so I suppose the better question is where is the terminal side of a triangle? ; The terminal side is the ending side of the angle, which always starts on the positive x-axis.  Since P is in Quadrant II, the angle is a 2nd quadrant angle.  If you draw that point, connect it to the origin, and make a right triangle with your segment as the hypotenuse,angle H is the angle with vertex at the origin.  The hypotenuse, by Pythagorean Theorem , is sqrt (16+4) = sqrt(20)\n\nNow you can use SOH CAH TOA to find sine (opposite leg/hypotenuse) = 2/sqrt(20) \n\ncosine = adjacent leg/hyp. = -4/sqrt(20)\n\ntangent = opp.leg/adj.leg = -2/4\n\nYou could then simplify sqrt(20) = sqrt(4x5) = 2 sqrt 5 and cancel if you need to, and rationalize the denominator if you need to.

Is she superstitious or is that part of her religion or what? ; It's an old superstition / nicety to say something like that from the days of ignorance of illnesses and when a sneeze could be the sign of something far more serious than a cold such as bubonic plague which ravaged Europe in 1665. It was thought that God would, somehow, cure you. Naturally this belief was fostered with the fact that if it was only a cold or tickly nose then the sneezer would eventually recover so, to people at that time, saying 'Bless You' would appear to be effective.At that time it was fashionable to carry nosegays, small handkerchiefs doused in perfume or wrapped around aromatic flowers, to disguise the terrible smells in towns where there were no sewer systems and rotten stuff and excrement littered the streets. Sneezing at such filth would be quite common.\n\nHowever like all superstitions it doesn't work and is now merely regarded as a courtesy. If your friend is so obsessed that she feels that she has to say it try two things. Firstly explain that all superstition is bunkum and is based on ignorance and stupidity. not fact and secondly offer yourself as a guinea pig to prove it.

9,"Parrot talk!  Who taught some- that Americans won't do menial labor? ; Where does this idea come from? Many are maids, farm workers, construction, lawn-its not just the people from Mexico. A guest work pass is fine if companies need more. It would would not drain our system (Aid, schools,housing on them)We need to help the people in our own nation-who need Health-food-housing- its millions (look on web).It seems many do not care about them-so they want them to suffer because of aid to others-what kind of Justice is that? And that excuse is very old. Everyone feels for the poor-but we don't trample on others-so others can get more. Hello- there is not enough money for everyone-it is not an endless pot. If those who want to help others-start a fund. I am not going to see others hurt in your so called humanity efforts that effect other here already. And it does effect them! Educate yourself and quit repeating mindless words. ; The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea",6173

3,"Tsunami????? ; which countries in future r in danger of being hit by a tsunami ????? ; History repeats itself, so I say one of the below:\n\n""Previous tsunamis\nSee also List of historic tsunamis by death toll.\n\nTsunamis occur most frequently in the Pacific Ocean, but are a global phenomenon; they are possible wherever large bodies of water are found, including inland lakes, where they can be caused by landslides. Very small tsunamis, non-destructive and undetectable without specialized equipment, occur frequently as a result of minor earthquakes and other events.\n\n[edit]\nCirca 65 million years B.C\nA meteor impact created the Chicxulub Crater about 65 million years ago. This impact may also have caused the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event. There is clear evidence for a tsunami more than one kilometre high. (See Discovery of the Chicxulub Crater.) The tsunami disturbed and transported sediments over a huge distance.\n\n[edit]\nCirca 1,500 B.C.\nThe eruption of the Santorini volcano about 3,500 years ago generated a megatsunami estimated at 600 feet. The effects of this megatsunami disturbing sediment at the bottom of the Mediterranean have been found. It has been theorised that the story of The Passage of the Red Sea as described in the Torah may have been due to this. Proponents suggest that the tsunami could have caused waters to recede temporarily and then drowned the Egyptian army when they later returned, however this is purely speculative. The Tsunami was nonetheless a real event that has been proved by geologists. [7] (See Cause of the Passage of the Red Sea.)\n\n[edit]\n1607 - Bristol Channel, England and Wales\nIn 2002 it was suggested that the Bristol Channel floods of 1607 in England and Wales, UK, may have been caused by a tsunami.\n\n[edit]\n1700 - Vancouver Island, Canada\nJanuary 26 - The Cascadia Earthquake, one of the largest earthquakes on record, ruptures the Cascadia Subduction Zone offshore from Vancouver Island to northern California, creating a tsunami logged in Japan and oral traditions of the Native Americans.\n\n[edit]\n1755 - Lisbon, Portugal\nTens of thousands of Portuguese who survived the great 1755 Lisbon earthquake were killed by a tsunami which followed a half hour later. Many townspeople fled to the waterfront, believing the area safe from fires and from falling debris from aftershocks. Before the great wall of water hit the harbour, waters retreated, revealing lost cargo and forgotten shipwrecks.\n\nThe earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent fires killed more than a third of Lisbon's pre-quake population of 275,000. Historical records of explorations by Vasco da Gama and other early navigators were lost, and countless buildings were destroyed (including most examples of Portugal's Manueline architecture). Europeans of the 18th century struggled to understand the disaster within religious and rational belief systems. Philosophers of the Enlightenment, notably Voltaire, wrote about the event. The philosophical concept of the sublime, as described by philosopher Immanuel Kant in the Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime, took inspiration in part from attempts to comprehend the enormity of the Lisbon quake and tsunami.\n\n[edit]\n1883 - Krakatoa explosive eruption\nThe island volcano of Krakatoa in Indonesia exploded with devastating fury in 1883, blowing its underground magma chamber partly empty so that much overlying land and seabed collapsed into it. A series of large tsunami waves was generated from the explosion, some reaching a height of over 40 metres above sea level. Tsunami waves were observed throughout the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, the American West Coast, South America, and even as far away as the English Channel. On the facing coasts of Java and Sumatra the sea flood went many miles inland and caused such vast loss of life that one area was never resettled but went back to the jungle and is now the Ujung Kulon nature reserve.\n\n The aftermath of the tsunami that struck Newfoundland in 1929.[edit]\n1929 - Newfoundland tsuna",6227
6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.  Answer those questions and you should be able to find a more specific answer via your resources.",6229

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.",6246

Even that isn't going to be so easy. For example, it is clear that if we write\nt_k (x)=sum p_nk x^n,\nthen\na_n=sum p_nk  c_k.\n\nNotice that even a_0 will depend on infinitely many c_k (since t_k(0)=p_0k  is non-zero for all even k).\n\nAdded:\nIt looks like\na_0 = sum (-1)^k c_{2k}.\nThere is a recurrence relation among the p_nk which you might be able to exploit to get formulas for the other a_k. I'll think about it a bit more.\n\nAdded:\nOK. In an e-mail you suggested doing the integrals for the expnasions of x^alpha. Here's a suggestion:\nYou want to evaluate \nint_-1^1 x^n t_k(x)/sqrt(1-x^2) dx.\nif you let x=cos(A), then t_k(x)=cos(kA), so the integral transforms into\nint_-pi/2^pi/2 cos^n(A) cos(kA) dA.\nIf you now write this in terms of complex exponentials and expand by the binomial theorem, several terms will zero out.

Someone told me he can only be here a total of 6 months per year. Is that per calendar year? We're not yet ready to marry so we can't get a fiance  visa, he'd love to find work here and stay though. ; Under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) citizens of certain countries can come here for upto 90 days without getting a visa.  They can still get other visas such as the B1/B2 visa which would allow them to stay up to 6 months.\n\nThe advantage of the VWP is that they just need a machine readable passport and a return ticket and a good story to tell the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer (if he askes).\n\nThe disadvantages of a VWP are that the visitor must leave within 90 days or they can be barred from using it in the future (make SURE that the green form is turned into the airline on his departure).\n\nThe main disadvantage is that the visitor signs away (waives) all recourse.  The CBP officer at the port of arrival can ""just say no"" and back on the plane the visitor goes without recourse.  Also a VWP does not allow adjustment of status.  For example, you two find true love and get married, too bad, back he goes!\n\nIf he came in under a B1/B2 (or other visas) or even as an Entry Without Inspection EWI (pronounced Eee Wee) he can adjust status in some circumstances.\n\nIf he works at all, even for tips at a diner, he is ""out of status"" and is the easiest illegal to process.

The paperwork is minimal and language is not usually a problem!]\n\nMillions of people would love to find work here and stay.\n\nTo you and any other US citizen considering marriage to an alien.\n\nIt amazes me how many divorces occur once the alien gets the ""lawful permanent resident"" (pronounced ""Lapper"") or green card.\n\nAlso a LPR who gets arrested can be deported back home.

8,"*adult* Sex Question? ; I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I love him very much.  We are still both rather young... I'm 18 and he's 20.  Anyways, when it comes to sex, I'm more shy and he... let's just say he watches a lot a porn... so he wants to alway stry out these kinky things.  A lot of the time, it just goes straight against my character (not morals..kind.. how I act) and so I can never seem to feel comfortable pretending to be something I'm not.  I'm not totally against the idea, but I always tell him ""wait until we are older when we actually need that spark... ect"" and that I am not comfortable doing it, but he still demands it.  He even puts up certain dates for me to do it now... He will say ""Okay you haven't done ""x"" in a while, so do it by next week"".  It's really frustrating because I feel like I can't please him, and I kind of feel selfish for not doing what he wants (because trust me.. he gives me more than enough ""lovin"").  What should I do to feel more comfortable?? ; Actually, my dear, there is nothing that ""you"" should do...he is the one with the ""issue"". Sex is supposed to be fun, sex is supposed to be caring, sex is supposed to be sacred(and I mean doing things together that bring you closer, not thinking like this). I am frankly outraged that your boyfriend is acting...aherm...like such a jerk. \nNow don't get me wrong, I love getting ""kinky""...but my husband, not so much; not because he is prudish, or because he doesn't want to please me, but because he is not comfortable. You are 18, you should be having a good time, not worring about whether or not you're getting enough ""kink"" into your relationship with your apparently very immature boyfriend. \nAnd he is demanding that you do things...BAH...that is loathsome to me...it is one thing to request or suggest...maybe even ""dabble"" in the kinky to see if you both enjoy it...but if you don't enjoy it; that's it, game over...if you wish to try it again, it will be on your terms, not his...and watching a lot of porn is not an excuse.\nLet me give you the perfect example, and hopefully you'll see my point...I am very into bondage, my husband is more than happy to ""dish it"" but not much for taking it...so okay, I can work with that. I let my inner dominatrix out in other ways; but anyway, one nite he felt like exploring, so I tied him up. He did not like it, not one bit and kinky things usually had to deal with trust...so I let it go. A couple of nites later, he was willing to try it again, and so on and so forth. \nSo from my example hopefully you can see that what your boyfriend is doing is not ""adult""; it is the utmost in immaturity and a complete lack of understanding. Talk to him, frankly tell him I said so, a kinky woman that understands the rules in the adult playground...and if he doesn't get it; dump him. There are more fish in the sea than him...and probably better ones (if you know what I mean) than him as well. If you don't play by the rules, you're going to get flown off of the merry-go-round, and it's just that simple honey...so put on your big girl boots and lay down the rules for his little games...and if he breaks 'em; he's out...and somebody new can play ""red-rover"" with you.",6301

From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars. The victims of 9/11 have also embraced them. \n\nBelow are some links to some films that will enlighten you on the subject. \n\nWarning: if you have your mind made up that the government holds no responsibility whatsoever and if you unconditionally defend those in power despite overwhelming evidence that proves otherwise, don't bother clicking below. Your patriotism is the cheapest and weakest one possible. It is the type that never questions authority, a direct opposition to what the founding fathers urged all of us to do when they drafted the Constitution. \n\nLaugh, scoff, or give thumbs down if you are weak in this regard. \n\nIf you are strong, truly patriotic, and willing to face the truth no matter how painful, and if you have some time to spare, click the links below. Or at least add to favorites for future viewing. \n\nIf you are convinced ny viewing this evidence that suggests 9/11 needs further investigation, then urge your Congressional Reps and Senators to re-open 9/11.

0,"Jesus is lord who can dispute it ??? ; why the father of lies thats who. ; The Requirements for the Messiah and Christian Contradictions.\n\nA. Here is just a brief list of some of the requirements for the Messiah:\n\n(1) He must be Jewish (see Deut. 17:15; Numb. 24:17);\n(2) He must be descended from Judah (Gen. 49:10) and Solomon (numerous places, but see I Chron 22:9-10);\n(3) With the coming of the Messiah will be the physical ingathering of Judah from the four corners of the earth (Isa. 11:12, 27:12-13);\n(4) Also with coming of the Messiah will be the reestablishment of the Holy Temple (Micah 4:1);\n(5) In addition the Messianic age will be one of world-wide peace (Isa. 2:4, 11:6, Micah 4:3); and, finally,\n(6) In the Messianic age the entire world will believe in G-d (Isa. 11:9, 40:5; Zephaniah 3:9).\n\nB. Satisfying the Criteria -- the Geneology Problem\n\nEven if Christians could establish that (a) Jesus existed and (b) Jesus was Jewish, they would have trouble proving that (c) Jesus was descended from Judah and Solomon. Both of the detailed geneologies in Matthew and Luke trace Joseph's lineage to King David, albeit differently since Matt. 1:16 says that a fellow named Jacob was Jospeph's father, and Luke 3:23 tells us that Joseph was the son of Eli. (It seems that that family had a lot of problems determining fatherhood.) But these geneologies are bogus because Matthew tells us that Joseph wasn't the father of Jesus, but Mary was still a virgin even after he was conceived through the ""Holy Spirit""! Matt. 1:18. Since we know that geneology runs from the father (Numbers 1:18; 2:2), Jesus cannot claim descendency from Judah.\n\nC. No Messianic Era.\n\nEven still, Christians still have a problem because they still can't establish points 3, 4, 5, or 6 in paragraph A, above. Saying that those events will happen in a Second coming is circular at best and contradicts Revelations 22:20 (""Yes, I am coming quickly."")\n\n\n  \nAbuse and Misquotes of the Hebrew Bible\n\nA. Isaiah 53. Who Was the ""Suffering Servant""?\n\nMissionaries commonly Isaiah 53 as a proof text that the Messiah will suffer for the people's sins. E.g.:\n\n""(3)He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with sickness; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not:\n(4)Surely he has borne our sicknesses, and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, struck by God, and afflicted:\n(5)But he was wounded because of our transgressions, he was bruised because of our iniquities; his sufferings were that we might have peace; and by his injury we are healed:\n(6)All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all:\n(7)He was oppressed, but he humbled himself and opened not his mouth; he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep, that is dumb before its shearers, he did not open his mouth:\n(8)By oppression and false judgment was he taken away; and of his generation who considered? For he was cut off from the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people:\n(9)And they made his grave among the wicked, and his tomb among the rich; although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth:""\n\nOn its face it sounds convincing in retrospect knowing what we know about Jesus from the NT only. But, who is the ""he"" referred to in the verses? Let's trace it back a few lines to the previous chapter (52), where the discussion of what ""he"" will do begins. At 52:13 it appears to begin with ""Behold, my servant shall prosper, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.""\n\nOK, so now we know that ""he"" is G-d's ""servant."" But who is G-d's ""servant""? Let's trace our steps a little further. In Isaiah 41:8 the question is answered: ""But Israel is my servant."" The next line, Isaiah 41:9, adds some more: ""You are ",6366

Make sure when you give her orange juice she has something in her tummy so that the acid doesn't burn the lining of her stomach. \n Getting phlegm stuck in her throat like that is a sign of dehydration, she's not drinking enough fluids. If you find that you can't make her drink more water then I would make the small amount of fluids she does drink make more of a difference. Try giving her Gatorade, orange juice, 7-Up, and Pedialyte when she's thirsty. All those liquids will help balance the electrolytes in her body, keeping better hydrated and her bodily functions working better. \nWhen she starts coughing try giving her peppermints to suck on, the peppermint settles her stomach, makes her throat slick (making it easier to cough phlegm up), and the peppermint oil will help loosen up her sinuses.\nI hope she feels better soon.",6423

Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

At worst, it can be a bit of a headache if you ever need to prove that you are in the US legally (to receive benefits such as a driver's license in some states, get a new job, recieve social services like worker's comp, unemployment insurance, etc.)  There may also be a relatively small fine, as all green card holders over the age of 18 are supposed to have their green card on their person at all times.  Having said all that, as long as you don't have any complicated issues to resolve (criminal problems, physical presence issues, etc), it is nto very expensive to either renew your green card or to apply for your citizenship.",6433

She said she was rubbing the male G spot and said it's the same spot that gay men hit when they have sex together.  I've wondered for years if I was gay because of numerous other reasons and now I get something like this happening.  Am I gay? ; Haha. Someone discovered something new. Hey man, your wife is misinformed. And you, obviously have not thoroughly explored your body...till now. We all have played with ourselves. Though, some slightly more than others. There are lots of ways for a guy to have intense orgasms. Anyway, the media and the gay community is always perpetrating that a man who dresses well, who's too good looking and goes to the gym is gay. And that such men should stop pretending and come out. This hype causes these type of men to question themselves with questions like ""I like it when I/my gf/my wife plays with my anus so am I gay?"" or ""I do envy other males with better physique than mine so am I gay?""...etc. This is overblown. And it doubles as a strategy to confuse and turn the fashion conscious, good looking, gym going men, gay. Yes it works. There men who are ""recruited"" gays. Truth is there's always a reason a man becomes gay. No one is born gay. Anyway the percentage of hetero men is higher than our homo counterparts. Whatever it is, the numerous other reasons n questions that you have, can only be answered by yourself. Some men do experience this phase of self questioning. Some don't. If you like men, lust after men, wanna have sex with men, wanna develop relationships with men or marry or live together. Then you are gay. If you don't, then you're not. Having questions doesn't make you gay. Looking at other guys doesn't make you gay. The decisions and choices do. Simple.\n\nWell now that you've added the details, its certainly more complicated. ok so you've probably had a sort of a gay lifestyle back then. But think of the reality, which is now. Are you happy with your wife and marriage? What about children? do you have children? Do you love your wife? why did you marry her in the first place? think of all the moments that both of you shared. If its all good. Then ending the marriage would destroy her and your children (if you have any). Not ending the marriage, will mean that you're not being honest to your wife and yourself. Either way someone will get hut. It boils down to you. Yes, its really difficult. Think about it and weigh the situations. You could talk to your wife about the problem, maybe with a counsellor too.

Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.",6548

Unfortunately, the mad bomber (whom I have already eliminated) has placed a ticking bomb attached to a vest she's now wearing.*\nOkay, I was just kidding. But my question is: if this was the scenario, how do I go about defusing a human bomb? I want actual bomb squad procedures, so no nonsensical answers, please. How do REAL bomb defusers go about dismantling a live explosive?\n*Bonus points for spotting which movie this scenario is derived from. ; Obviously it is the end sequence of the movie ""Speed"" with can't act I mean keaneau reeves and dennis hopper.\n\nAnyway, A bomb is still a bomb and follows under the same guidelines regardless of whether it's on a human or in a car etc.  It will have an explosive medium--the part that goes boom, and a detonating device, like a blasting cap which causes the explosive to go boom, and possibly a timer which tells the detonating device when to detonate, and a triggering device.   And a power source for all those parts requiring an electrical impulse.  \nThe procedures used usually try to remove power from the overall device, if that is not possible, try to prevent the electrical impulse from making it to the trigger or detonator.  If all else fails, take the device somewhere that will cause minimal damage and blow it up in a controlled setting...sorry if this means eliminating the hostage.",6586

One, mass 80 kg, pushes the other and, according to Newton, is simultaneously pushed back in the opposite direction while the other, mass 50 kg, goes flying off across the ice at 4 m/s. This is a closed system, right? So where did that 200 kilogram meters per second of momentum imparted to the lighter skater come from? Yikes! Could the heavier skater have acquired the SAME momentum in the opposite direction? Is it possible that, after all this time since Newton, momentum is STILL conserved? Does MV = mv, where M is the mass of the heavier skater, V the velocity of the heavier skater, m the mass of the lighter skater, and v the velocity of the lighter skater? Does (80) V = (50) (4)? Does V = 2.5 meters per second? Nah! Lard butt's extra mass caused their skates to dig into the ice, and created enough friction to slow them down to 0.0025 meters per second... probably.",6598

Get into Network Marketing. The reasons being are:\n\n1- The Training - The good companies work with organization who will help you develop you knowledge in all aspects of your business and you before the product or service. This means time and energy will be invested on developing you and a person and business-owner vs pushing you to move products.  Not to say that you shouldn't be moving products, that's why you're in business. \n\n2- Developing a Network - In order to have a strong and prosperous business you need repeat business. These organizations of  business owners will help you in the developing strong networks so that your business keeps moving forward.\n\n3- Global Opportunities - No more do you have to limit your self to just you neighborhood  with the advent of the Internet you now have access to a global marketplace. The larger companies and organizations can help you in expanding you business into the international arena if the opportunity arises for you.\n\n4- Low Risk - Most companies have a low start-up investment\nwhich means that you can work it on a part-time level until you are making enough to go full-time. So you don't have to quit your job or quit school. Also the highly reputable ones have a money-back guarantee.\n\nPoints -\n1- You may of heard for people failing to succeed in this type of business most of it is attributed to  some people fail to treat it like a business. \n\n2-A business is a business and you won't get anything out of it if you don't put anything in it.\n\n3- As a very wealthy man once told me ""Check the fruit on the tree"". Be careful of who you take advice from, check the fruit on their tree. Are they where you want to be or are they even going in that direction. \n\n\nSo keep up in doing your research and the best is yet to come.\n\n\nMy recommendation is Quixtar. They're a 6-billion dollar company. I've dealt with some of the people before. Lovely people. What I like is that they have a wide variety of products and services to offer so a person is not limited to just one or two things. Also they also seem to be on the cutting edge of product technology. Let them help you get in contact with someone in your area who can help you.",6618

1,"What is H.E.P. and how does it differ from Particle Physics? ; What does a High Energy Physicist do and how does it differ from a Particle Physicist? And are the only two places they can work is in a University or a Particle Accelerator? ; Particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them. It is also called ""high energy physics"", because many elementary particles do not occur under normal circumstances in nature, but can be created and detected during energetic collisions of other particles, as is done in particle accelerators.\n\nResearch work certainly requires a particle accelerator, which can be found in both university and private environments. (see link for lists).  There is also a huge body of work in public policy, to expand the research arena, and theory, devising potential projects for the researchers.\n\nSo, H.E.P (high energy physics) and particle physics are essentially the same thing.  A physicist specializing in this area can work in areas other than universities and particle accelerators.\n\nGreat Question!  I learned something new!!",6628
5,"Deer sheds? ; Why do deer shed their antlers, and why is it at only a certain time frame of the year? ; Why do deer shed their antlers?\nDeer shed their antlers annually as a prelude to the regeneration, or re-growth, of new ones.\n\nThe entire shedding process takes a mere two to three weeks to complete, and the re-growth phase takes place over the summer. The docile male deer that, with the exception of the male and the female reindeer, solely sports antlers, sheds them between January and April, after the autumn mating season draws to a close. He can do without antlers at this time, because his need for them in prior months, to attract and to impress females for his harem of mates, and to fight with his competitors for the females' affections, no longer exists.\n\nThe antlers themselves differ from the hollow horns of cattle, in that they comprise solid bone tissue with a honey combed structure. Pedicles, or knobby, skin-covered nubs protruding from the skull, support the deer's antlers, or points, which range in number from one shaft to eleven branches. The pedicles are a permanent fixture on the deer's forehead, and are the point from which the antlers annually break off.\n\nDuring the first year the pedicles appear on the young deer's forehead. The following year, the youngster sprouts straight, spike- like shafts, and in the third year, the first branch appears. In successive years, as the deer matures, his antlers lengthen and, in most species, he acquires additional branches. One can actually determine the age of the deer from the number of branches on his antlers, as their number increases with age.\n\n During the growth phase of the bony antlers, they are covered with a sensitive skin referred to as ""velvet,"" which is filled with blood vessels that feed the antlers the vitamins and the minerals necessary to build up the bone, and to promote normal antler growth. Antler growth spans two to four months, after which time the velvet is no longer needed, and a ring, which effectively serves as a shutoff valve, forms at the base of the antlers and cuts off the blood supply to the velvet. As a result, the velvet withers, dries up, and falls off, often assisted by the deer, which rubs his antlers against tree bark. The antler regeneration is complete, and the shedding cycle will resume once mating season in the fall concludes.",6629

7,"Star Wars confusion? ; I know this question has been asked a 1000 times but I really need to know.\n\nI have been a fan of Star Wars since i was nearly 7 years old when New Hope came back to theatres (missed the first showing). I waited 20 years for the prequels and i still wait (with some hope) for a sequel.\n\nBut as soon as Ep 1-3 came out people put them down. Yet these were greatly done (except a few certain charectors) with great story lines. \n\nIn 1993 i read the original scripts to ep 2-3 (missed the ep 1 script) and reread them again in 2000 on the internet. They followed Luca's original plan pretty much. All though a few names were changed.\n\nSo my question is this. How the hell do people put down the prequels? was it that Lucas waited too long? cant be the movies themselves. Ep3 was a work of art of the story line. \n\nOnly things i wish they hadnt changed were:\n\n1. the battle between Obi-wan and Anakin happened at the beggining of the stoyr of ep 3, because the jedi and Palpetine both learn ; Personally, I think Anakin is a moron for falling for flattery.

If you can convince a Jury that you had reason to believe your life is in danger, then lethal force is justified.\n\nIf you respond to a shove with a punch then that is what the police classify as a ""Fray"" and both parties are basically consenting participants in violence, and are both equally responsible.\n\nIf property is involved or threatened then the ""victim"" is usually considered to be in the right, but witnesses will be required unless there is little room for doubt (ie if property was actualy stolen).\n\nThe old adage ""Property is 9/10ths of the law"" is acually true!",6646

6,"What is your opinion? ; I live an hour and a half away from work and have to commute every day (Monday - Friday).  It puts a lot of miles and wear and tear on my car, not to mention costs a lot, and takes a lot of time and energy.  I found a house twice as close to work that I am interested in purchasing.\n\nI live with my boyfriend.  I am 19 years old and he is 20 years old.  I have a bit of credit established and he does not at all.  If we are going to purchase this house any time soon (our lease goes up October 1st) it will have to be in my name since I have credit and he does not.\nMy idea is (if I can get pre-approved) that we should go ahead and get the house in my name and put the utilities in his name while he builds credit. Once he has credit built up and/or we are married, we will refinance to put the house in both of our names.\nHis idea is to wait to buy a house until he has established credit.  But in the meantime, it costs me a lot of time, money, and energy to work so far away.\n\nSuggestions? ; I will preface my answer by stating that I am a licensed Realtor® in the state of Arizona.\n\nIt sounds to me like you have your act together even for a person of your age.

6,"What are some good credit cards for credit repair that AREN'T scams? ; I've never had a credit card (although my credit sucks) and heard they're a great way to repair credit. Any tips? ; First all, if you're trying to repair your credit, the APR shouldn't matter because if you're really committed you will pay off all bills in full every month!\n\nTry the credit cards offered by your bank first. Banks have a soft-spot for their customers and that can be a positive factor in their credit approval.\n\nNext, look at cards offered by Chase, CapitalOne or Citibank.  These are reputable company.\n\nOrchard Bank should never be a choice if you're building credit. In my opinion, their lending practices border on predatory. Fees are outrageous, and they are not very good at disclosing hidden ones.\n\nIf your credit is as bad as your say, be prepared.  \n    You may be denied.   \n    You may be offered a secured credit card.\n    You may be offered a credit card with a higher rate.  \n\nIf you're denied for credit, don't keep trying. Wait for at least 6 months before you try again. When you apply for a credit card, the lender will get your credit report. The more you apply for credit, the lower your score can get and less like you are to be approved for credit.\n\nVicious cycle, right?\n\nIf the credit card has a high APR, consider accepting the card.  The high APR will only affect you if you carry a balance at the end of each statement cycle.  BUT pay off everything when the bill comes. \n\nIf you do this, you won't see your credit improve right away.  It may takes anywhere from 1-7 years to repair your credit.\n\nIf you were offered a secured credit card, think twice. Lenders don't just look at your credit score or whether you have a good repayment history. They also look at the type of credit lines you have.",6702

1,"What percentage of people are homosexual? ; I've heard anywhere from one to ten percent and i'm curious which is more accurate. Please send me links to any publication that deals with this issue. I am looking for a credible source here. Thanks. ; Ten percent is probably a huge exaggeration, though it somehow became the standard figure for a while. This may date back to the 1950s, when Alfred Kinsey published his books about sexuality. Because many people who didn't identify as homosexual had had homosexual experiences nonetheless, some people read these data and concluded exclusive homosexuality was much more common than it probably is.\n\nThere are SO many variables involved in determining the underlying conditions behind your very good question. Gender identity is so fluid and flexible that people don't always fit easily into categories ""homosexual,"" ""heterosexual,"" ""bisexual,"" and the like. \n\nAnother complication is that, although you ask the question very broadly, a given percentage of any specific population - a self-selected or self-identified one, for example = won't necessarily have a constant statistical proportion of people of any given sexuality represented within it. And variables that may not seem to correlate at all with sexual behavior of the members of a group may be better determinants of what those people identify themselves as. \n\nIn some cultures, the concept of ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" in the Western European & American senses of those terms don't really exist. Other social constructions of same-sex relationships under different conditions, with rituals, subdialects, and patterns of secrecy exist that it would be unfair to characterize in the same terms that we use in the West.\n\nSo, I haven't given you a percentage, but I hope this helps a little.\n\nBy the way, I'm about 90% gay myself. The other ten percent vacillates between being curious and being sleepy.",6711

Be prepared to march down to the school a lot to try to get this taken care of. Your grandkids CAN learn! Then, if none of that works, consider homeschooling, or have the parents consider homeschooling, whichever is more appropriate. Like some of these teachers said, they are trained to educate regular student, not special children. I know a boy with FAS and a myriad of other diagnoses, and when he was eight years old, he snuck out of a locked campus and was halfway home before his grandma was called and told he was missing. He had walked about five miles. Homeschooling gives you the advantage of knowing your grandson's individual problems. There are so many different types of problems going on in a special ed class, that I don't blame the teacher for being overwhelmed. Most special ed kids excel once they start being taught at home because they are in an environment they know, with loving caregivers who understand the complexities of their own disorders, and are able to work at their own pace. There's no distractions like there are in a classroom. It just seems to work. There are several place you can turn to to learn about homeschooling kids with special needs. Check yahoo groups, there's a lot. I'm on HS-Plus, and it's a really good group. Lots of different disorders being dealt with, FAE/FAS is a big one, so you'd get lots of help.

Do you think time can be thought of in terms of a straight line or is it a circle.  No beginning and no end. ; By definition, the big-bang is the beginning of the known universe; that is to say: everything that can be known is from after the big-bang. And so, implicitly your question is answered – time started with the big-bang, simply because we can not find any proof of it’s existence before. (I know, it is a little confusing.)\n\nAs to time’s linearity –\nI’ll start with a different difficult concept – infinity. \nDraw a square grid. Stretch it to infinity. ALL of its edges are now at infinity. In any direction you choose to move, you will eventually reach infinity. The same word describes your location no matter where you are. If all these places are denoted by one word-symbol-number, than all these places are one!\nGauss was first to visualize this: take your infinite grid and wrap it around a sphere with a radius of one that rests at its origin. The point (0,0) would become a southern pole, the point we called infinity would become the northern pole. \nAny infinite straight line would become a circle when drawn on this sphere grid. \n\nNow I’ll give you back your question: what do you think is the shape of the time line?",6764

A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.

Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.  I really like the scubapros but there are *many* great choices.

The girl and the girl's family decided to say they were going to leave the Netherlands and head back to Kosovo, for a new start they got 7000 euros.

But she still has to right to finish school.  \nI am telling the public story, I am not intending to hurt her or anyone else.

9,"are these not good enough reasons to impeach Bush ? ; I ask Congress to impeach President Bush and Vice President Cheney for the following reasons: \n1. Violating the United Nations Charter by launching an illegal ""War of Aggression"" against Iraq without cause, using fraud to sell the war to Congress and the public, misusing government funds to begin bombing without Congressional authorization, and subjecting our military personnel to unnecessary harm, debilitating injuries, and deaths. \n\n2. Violating U.S. and international law by authorizing the torture of thousands of captives, resulting in dozens of deaths, and keeping prisoners hidden from the International Committee of the Red Cross. \n\n3. Violating the Constitution by arbitrarily detaining Americans, legal residents, and non-Americans, without due process, without charge, and without access to counsel. \n\n4. Violating the Geneva Conventions by targeting civilians, journalists, hospitals, and ambulances, and using illegal weapons, including white phosphorous, depleted uranium, and a new type of napalm. \n\n5. Violating U.S. law and the Constitution through widespread wiretapping of the phone calls and emails of Americans without a warrant. \n\n6. Violating the Constitution by using ""signing statements"" to defy hundreds of laws passed by Congress. \n\n7. Violating U.S. and state law by obstructing honest elections in 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006. \n\n8. Violating U.S. law by using paid propaganda and disinformation, selectively and misleadingly leaking classified information, and exposing the identity of a covert CIA operative working on sensitive WMD proliferation for political retribution. \n\n9. Subverting the Constitution and abusing Presidential power by asserting a ""Unitary Executive Theory"" giving unlimited powers to the President, by obstructing efforts by Congress and the Courts to review and restrict Presidential actions, and by promoting and signing legislation negating the Bill of Rights and the Writ of Habeas Corpus. \n\n10. Gross negligence in failing to assist New Orleans residents after Hurricane Katrina, in ignoring urgent warnings of an Al Qaeda attack prior to Sept. 11, 2001, and in increasing air pollution causing global warming. ; All you have to do is PROVE it, with FACTS not sound bites, political ads, or forgeign propaganda. Does obstructing ""honest"" elections mean making it harder for the dead in Chicago to vote or guarranteeing the U.S. military votes WILL be counted? CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow.

1,"Does the full moon affect the speed of the earth's rotation? ; Can the moon's effect on gravity and tides vary or affect the speed of the earth's rotation i.e. speed it up/slow it down ever so slightly during monthly moon phases? If so, is it a stretch to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly as well? ; No, the apparent ""phase"" of the moon is relative to where you are on earth at a particular time and the moon's position in relation to the earth and the sun, it does not effect the earth's rotation.  That being said the moon has had an impact on the earth's rotation, and we can assume that it continues to exert the same gravitational forces it has through antiquity.  This isn't exactly true because the moon's orbit is actually getting larger at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters per year (negligible change)*. \n\nAs to stretching these facts to assume that it might affect the space-time continuum ever so slightly I have read several scholarly articles dealing with gravitational forces and their affect on time. Of all of these Stephen Hawking's were the easiest for me to understand and the most interesting to read.  You might want to check out his books ""A Brief History of Time"" and ""The Universe in a Nutshell"", both should be available at your local library.  Whether gravity exerted by the moon is strong enough to influence time on earth or not I’m not sure but I would assume so.  If I remember correctly the closer you are to a center of gravity the faster time passes relative to someone farther away.  The visible phases of the moon would still have nothing to do with the affect on time however.  \n\nThat was an interesting question, I hope my answer was of some use to you!\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus\n*thanks for correcting me on the orbital change Answer Guy.",6806

But they wont mean anything to you, because you are now a Christian, and no longer a Jew, IF you ever were one......\n----------\nObviously, for a ""Jewish man,"" you know little of the Bible or of Judaism or of Gd.\n\nPLEASE look at the following::\nhttp://WhatJewsBelieve.org\nhttp://Convert.org \n\nThe basic beliefs of Christianity about Jesus are against what the Bible says, and so Real Jews cannot believe in Jesus at all.\n\nThe Christian understanding is that the Messiah, Jesus, died for the sins of the people. The messiah is supposed to be a human sacrifice that is the blood sacrifice necessary for the forgiveness of sin.\n\nBut we are taught in our Torah that no one can die for the sins of another. In Deuteronomy 24:16 it specifically says this:\n\nDeuteronomy 24:16 The fathers shall not \nbe put to death for the children, neither \nshall the children be put to death for\nthe fathers: \nevery man shall be put to death for his \nown sin (eesh b’chet-o yumatu).\n\nIn Exodus 32:30-35, Moses tries to offer himself to atone for the sins of the people. To be written out of Gd's book, means to be written out of the Book of Life, which means Moses was asking to die for the sins of the People. Gd's response is No, it does not work that way, each man dies for his own sin:\n\nExodus 32:30-35 And it came to pass on the \nmorrow, that Moses said unto the people, \nYe have sinned a great sin: and now I will \ngo up unto the Etrnl; perhaps I shall make \nan atonement for your sin. And Moses \nreturned unto the Etrnl, and said, Oh, \nthis people have sinned a great sin, and \nhave made them gods of gold. Yet now, if \nthou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, \nblot me, I pray thee, out of thy book \nwhich thou hast written. And the Etrnl \nsaid unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned \nagainst me, him will I blot out of my \nbook. \n\nThe whole of chapter 18 of the book of Ezekiel is about this idea, that no one can die for someone else's sin. Further, this chapter of Ezekiel teaches us that all we have to do for Gd's forgiveness is to stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd will forgive us.\n\nSo, the Bible is clear, no one can die for the sins of another, and this means that Jesus cannot die for anyone else's sins.\n\nChristians also believe that one needs a blood sacrifice for the forgiveness of sin, that one who does not have such a blood sacrifice will die in their sins, and go to hell, except for the sacrifice of Jesus.\n\nThis, too, is UnBiblical. The Bible describes blood sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin in the Book of Leviticus. But it is in Leviticus itself, in the middle of the discussion of the sin sacrifices, that we are taught that we do not need a blood sacrifice to be forgiven for our sins. Offering a blood sacrifice was an expensive thing to do for the family offering the animal. Was forgiveness then, to be only for the rich? No, because if one could not afford a blood sacrifice then one who sins could bring flour, which has no blood and no life as their sacrifice, and Gd forgave them!\n\nLeviticus 5:11-13; But if he be not able to \nbring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, \nthen he that sinned shall bring for his \noffering the tenth part of an ephah of fine \nflour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil \nupon it, neither shall he put any \nfrankincense thereon: for it is a sin \noffering.\n\nFurthermore, read the Book of Jonah. In Jonah, the People of Ninevah do three things in order to be forgiven by Gd. They fast, they pray for forgiveness, and they stop doing the Bad and start doing the Good, and Gd forgave them! This is exactly what we do on Yom Kippur, we fast, we pray for forgiveness, and, h",6811

3,"Who is nalson mandela? ; i need info byt the second of may ; Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born in Transkei, South Africa on July 18, 1918. His father was Chief Henry Mandela of the Tembu Tribe. Mandela himself was educated at University College of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand and qualified in law in 1942. He joined the African National Congress in 1944 and was engaged in resistance against the ruling National Party's apartheid policies after 1948. He went on trial for treason in 1956-1961 and was acquitted in 1961.\n\nAfter the banning of the ANC in 1960, Nelson Mandela argued for the setting up of a military wing within the ANC. In June 1961, the ANC executive considered his proposal on the use of violent tactics and agreed that those members who wished to involve themselves in Mandela's campaign would not be stopped from doing so by the ANC. This led to the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe. Mandela was arrested in 1962 and sentenced to five years' imprisonment with hard labour. In 1963, when many fellow leaders of the ANC and the Umkhonto we Sizwe were arrested, Mandela was brought to stand trial with them for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. His statement from the dock received considerable international publicity. On June 12, 1964, eight of the accused, including Mandela, were sentenced to life imprisonment. From 1964 to 1982, he was incarcerated at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town; thereafter, he was at Pollsmoor Prison, nearby on the mainland.\n\nDuring his years in prison, Nelson Mandela's reputation grew steadily. He was widely accepted as the most significant black leader in South Africa and became a potent symbol of resistance as the anti-apartheid movement gathered strength. He consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom.\n\nNelson Mandela was released on February 11, 1990. After his release, he plunged himself wholeheartedly into his life's work, striving to attain the goals he and others had set out almost four decades earlier. In 1991, at the first national conference of the ANC held inside South Africa after the organization had been banned in 1960, Mandela was elected President of the ANC while his lifelong friend and colleague, Oliver Tambo, became the organisation's National Chairperson.",6849
6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds. Also, be sure to balance this investment with some equity (stock) investments to give you diversification. Good luck!",6852

Haro makes their bikes heavier nowadays but they are well made and once you get to know the bike it will be much easier to manuever.

Eventually. \n\nThe Source is no 'man' or 'woman' sitting on a throne being wise, judge mental and all knowing it (It) is simply everything.  That was, will be, is or may be.  It is the fabric which which binds everything.  Before man began to categories or define it.\n\nThe second question within yours hints at the 'prophets' question of the being the only way to the Source. Jesus, Mohamed, Quetzalcoatl, Buddha etc. (note we are speaking only of the prophets of Light) each proclaim that their way is their path God. The ultimate source.\n\nHumans are different in their perceptions of everything so it is reasonable that God would have conceived of different paths to reach the One, ie enlightenment.",6898
2,"What is the safest and most effective diet pill?? (Read details)? ; I once told myself that I would never take diet pills, no matter what...However, I desperately need to lose some weight & I just can't find the time to go to the gym or jog...The main reason I want to lose weight is because I really don't feel comfortable with my body (I'm 5'9"" & 210 lbs.) Help, plz (& the prom is just around the corner...although I'm not sure if I'm going)!!!!!! ; There are none--side effects can be worse than the pill itself.  Learn to change your lifestyle and you'll be happier in the end and will end up not gaining the weight back from Drastic dieting or pills.  Once you start eating better and doing something for exercise the weight will come off --those that have more to lose will see a results faster than those that have only 5-10 lbs to lose.  For your weight, you'll have to eat around 2,500 calories a day (your body weight x 12), I know it seems like a lot but this will help.  This means 2,500 calories of HEALTHY food.  No sugar, white bread, rice, fast food, processed foods, etc.  Spread them out between 6 meals a day, every 2.5 hours, this means every meal will have to be 430 calories, not bad when you break it up.  Track your calories on Fitday.com and read fitness forums.  here's a good one:  introduce yourself and tell them ""rasberryco"" referred you :)  Good luck\n\nFitday.com\nhttp://z13.invisionfree.com/ExtremePhysique/index.php?",6900

What kind of sense does that make?\n\nHave people completely lost their minds? Why is all of this hatred suddently being directed at anyone and everyone who dares to display knowledge of any language besides English in the United States?

If you're pissed off about illegal immigration, fine, do something about it: start fining companies that hire illegals huge fines, and the illegal job market will dry up. If you're worried that people don't understand English and won't be able to find a job, then offer free or low-cost English classes at various times and on various days in neighbordhoods where there are lots of immigrants.

So you're saying that in order to avoid becoming like the Chinese, who were able to employ xenophobic, intolerant troops to squelch liberty by killing the protesting Hans, whom they disliked, we should become more intolerant and xenophobic. Does that not seem a little contradictory to you? No, no, no, if we want to avoid the path of the Chinese, we need to encourage TOLERANCE not intolerance.\n\nTo Concerned: Actually, plenty of Americans do move to China and expect to be spoken to in English. My ex-husband travels there all the time and may be transferred there next year. He speaks very little Chinese. Luckily, all the business people in China speak English, so when he's around, they speak English. They would make him an immigrant who doesn't speak the language, dear.\n\nAre you aware that something like 50% of the business in non-English speaking countries in Europe is conducted in English? That's because they're intelligent enough to realize that it's in their best interest to be multilingual.

Only citizens of the U.S. seem to think that they should never be forced to speak, or even listen to, another language. Talk about being rude!\n\nJust out of curiosity: when you travel to Europe or Asia on business and are talking to American co-workers, what language do you speak in? English? Then by your own rules, you're being rude.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026
1,"Is bipedal walking the most difficult thing to do for a human ? ; If bipedal walking was easy why are robots not able to walk in a bipedal manner. Since bipedal walking can be done only by humans  on this planet, it is the most difficult thing to learn and can be learnt only through evolution. Am I thinking right ? ; It's not the most difficult.  Look at how fast babies learn to walk compared to how fast they learn to talk.\n\nI read once that humans are the only bipedal mammal with no tail.  Kangaroos are bipedal (with tail) of course they don't walk.\n\nI would say it depends on the brain we are talking about: it's the simplest thing in the world for a large herbivore to walk, they do it within minutes of being born, predators can't walk for weeks.\n\nFor humans, maybe speech or higher cognitive skills are harder than walking.\n\nAs for robots, I don't know why they need to be bipedal, it is a very awkward and unsteady form of locomotion.

1,"is this even possible to solve and if u can how? ; After the parade, the ppl on the float I was on shook hands with eachother. The Mayor came over and shook hands with only the people he knew. How many people did he know if there were 1625 handshakes altogether? ; The answer is that the mayor knew 29 people. And, although you didn't ask it, there were 57 people on the float.\n\nProof:\nGiven a group of n people, if everybody shakes hands once with every other member of the group then there will be (n(n-1))/2 handshakes in total.\n1. If there were 58 people on the float then there would have been ((58*57)/2)=1653 handshakes. But this is more than the total number of handshakes specified in the question so there must have been less than 58 people on the float.\n2. If there were 56 people on the float then there would have been ((56*55)/2)=1540 handshakes. This would mean that the mayor would have had to shake hands with 85 people in order for the total number of handshakes to equal 1625. But if there were only 56 people on the float then it is impossible for the mayor to shake hands 85 times (assuming he only shakes hands once with each person he knows). So there must be more than 56 people on the float.\n2. If there were 57 people on the float then there would have been ((57*56)/2)=1596 handshakes. If the mayor shakes hands with 29 of the 57 people on the float then there would have been 1596+29=1625 handshakes which is what you wanted to know.\n\nBTW: Next time vote for a female mayor - she might have been gracious enough to shake hands with everybody on the float :)",7033

3,"Garrett Birkhoff info? ; need at least 8 facts. ; Garrett Birkhoff\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\nJump to: navigation, search\n \nGarrett Birkhoff.Garrett Birkhoff (January 19, 1911, Princeton, New Jersey, USA - November 22, 1996, Water Mill, New York, USA) was an American mathematician.\n\nThe son of the mathematician George David Birkhoff, Garrett began the Harvard University BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to Cambridge University in England to study mathematical physics but switched to studying abstract algebra under Philip Hall. While visiting the University of Munich, he met Carathéodory who pointed him towards two important texts, Van der Waerden on abstract algebra and Speiser on group theory.\n\nBirkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not even bother obtaining an MA. Nevertheless, after being a member Harvard's Society of Fellows,1933-36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard. From these facts can be inferred the number and quality of Birkhoff's papers published by his 25th year.\n\nDuring the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues Marshall Stone and Saunders MacLane, substantially advanced American teaching and research in abstract algebra. In 1941 he and MacLane published A Survey of Modern Algebra, the first undergraduate textbook in English on the subject. Birkhoff and MacLane (1967) is a more advanced text on abstract algebra. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, Lattice Theory (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned lattice theory into a major branch of abstract algebra. His 1935 paper, ""On the Structure of Abstract Algebras"" founded a new branch of mathematics, universal algebra. Birkhoff's approach to this subject owed little to Alfred North Whitehead's 1898 monograph bearing the same name.\n\nDuring and after WWII, Birkhoff's interests gravitated towards what he called ""engineering"" mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics. This weapons-related work culminated in his texts on fluid dynamics, Hydrodynamics (1950) and Jets, Wakes and Cavities (1957). Birkhoff, a friend of John von Neumann, took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. His research and consulting work (notably for General Motors) began to employ computational methods, such as numerical linear algebra and the representation of smooth curves via cubic splines.\n\nBirkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.Ds. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.",7081

5,"Could a good Judo Black Belt hold there own grappling with a Black Belt in Jujitsu? ; I've been training in Judo and Jujitsu and found that some Judo players are really skilled on the ground.  It seems very common now for Judo players to cross train in Jujistu and to spend at least a 1/3 of the class on the matwork.  I don't know if it is the same in all regions and clubs.  I know some clubs even in my own area spend more time on matwork than other clubs.  With the popularity on MMA and jujitsu I just think the trend has been to go to more matwork and maybe the Judo players are catching up?  Or maybe the Jujistsu fighters will almost always beat the Judo guys on the ground? ; Judo is a fantastic art, in my experience a skilled judo player will have the advantage on a juijitsu trained person.\n \n However If the Judo player has no experience in practical application of Judo techniques in real life situations, or again does not know the tools of juijitsu and how to be wary of them then some of the quick applications of juijitsu groundwork may be effective. As could any technique.\n\n The only judo trained player I have seen in action was from a third world country where he had ample experience in using judo to protect his health, i do not think any juijitsu player would have stood a chance against him.\n\n In my eyes its impossible to say this stystem over this one, it is often more a case of the player. Juijitsu certainly has some technical advantages on the ground as does judo when standing\n\n however this means very little, its all very hypothetical\n if opposing players trained in each squared up, they would surely be aware of the strengths and weaknesses that each style potentially has, and do thier best to try and avoid these\n\nmat work is not very good if the judo master has just thrown you fifteen feet into a tree",7094

If science does discover that life did exist on Mars, it will be the greatest science event to occur in the history of the world. \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Mars ; Statistically, it is very hard to believe that we (Earthliens) are along in the universe, there must be something else out there.\nAt the same time, the odds that life would develop independently on both Earth and Mars in the same solar system is pretty slim (unless life is actually not nearly as rare as we might think).\n\nThere is of course a chance that life may have developed on Mars in the past when the conditions were more suitable, but so far, we havent found anything.

The kids were tested and came back positive and were taken away. She says that she was told that she was legally responsible for him now. They've been together for approx 10 yrs but are not married. Is this true? I don't believe it is. ; Whether it is true depends on exactly what she was actually told.\nIf she had just posted bail/bond for the guy; then yes, she is legally responsible for him until his court date. That's the same for anyone putting up an appearance bond: you are legally responsible for the person showing up to court.\nIf they told her she could be legally responsible for him cooking in the house; that's a little gray. If she had any prior knowledge at all, she could be held legally responsible for not removing the children from the danger he posed by using the house for a meth lab.\nNow, there is a secondary element at work here. You said they were living together for about ten years. Depending on their conduct, and the laws regarding it in IA, the argument could be made that they actually *are* married, at least by common law; which would open her up to more liability.",7151

9,"For those that say they are against the death penalty but for abortion....? ; How can you support the taking of an innocent life and be opposed to taking the life of someone that has committed acts of evil? Those on death row have hurt innocent people, families, children and society. What acts has an unborn child committed to deserve the fate of being aborted. \n\nThis is a perfect example of how liberals are on the wrong side of issues. Liberals will claim that abortion is a right to privacy issue - the so called, ""it is my body and I can do with it what I wish"". Well- a person cannot do whatever they wish with their body if it effects me. You cannot take your fist (which is part of your body) and punch me in the face. A person has the right to privacy in their home, but that does not extend to activities which are illegal. Your rights end where my rights begin. A heart beats at less than 4 weeks. Isn't a heart beat the final determinat ; I know you don't actually want an answer - you seem more interested in pontificating.  Be that as it may, it is perfectly easy to justify a belief in the legality of abortion vs. the legality of the death penalty.  For me, capital punishment is a governmental rights issue - that is, I do not believe the government has the right to deprive its citizens of life under any circumstances.  It's simply something the government should not be allowed to do, because allowing it for some people (odious though they may be) makes it easier to apply it for lesser crimes - a slippery slope argument, essentially.\n\nAbortion is a different issue, because (1) it is not the government depriving someone of life; (2) there's no scientific reason to argue that life begins at conception; and (3) if we assume life begins at conception, then all laws regarding children would apply to zygotes/fetuses, which would be unworkable in any society.",7165

These chordates have the primitive support structure, a dorsal notochord. \nAdult Tunicates lack notochords, except for the planktoninc and tiny Appendiculaceans.  Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse. Almost all are included in genus Branchiostoma, so if you look for ""Branchiostoma"" or ""lancelet"" you'll get what you're searching.",7179

McKinley National Park in Alaska is the largest.  \n\nThe park was established as Mount McKinley National Park on February 26, 1917. Ironically, only a portion of Mount McKinley (not even including the summit) was within the original park boundary. The park was designated an international biosphere reserve in 1976. A separate Denali National Monument was proclaimed by Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978.\n\nMount McKinley National Park, whose name had been subject to local criticism from the onset, and Denali National Monument were incorporated and established into Denali National Park and Preserve by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, December 2, 1980. At this time the Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain back to ""Denali,"" even though the U.S. Board of Geographic Names maintains ""McKinley"". Alaskans tend to use ""Denali"" and rely on context to distinguish between the park and the mountain. The size of the national park is 4,740,906.73 acres (19,185.78 km²), of which 4,724,735.16 acres are federally owned. The national preserve is 1,334,200 acres (543.09 km²), of which 1,304,132 acres are federally owned. On December 2, 1980, a 2,146,580 acre Denali Wilderness was established within the park.",7211

3,"Spelling, grammer etc? ; Yeah I pretty much suck at all the spelling, grammer kinda of stuf, so can you guys help me out? I wrote this on copper:\n\nCopper comes from the Latin word cuprum. It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

They can give you something to help or help you understand what's going to happen. A calm patient usually heals better than a terrified one, so they will help.\n\nMost general anesthesia is given--at least the part that you will actually experience--in the IV.

1,"a math question? ; You are a manufacturer of steel containers(for liquids) of two basic shapes- tins shaped as right circular cylinders and rectangular boxes. The containers' capacity is 1 litre. Obviously you want to use the least amount of steel so as to maximise your profits. Can you work out the dimensions of the containers? How many different boxes of the same type will you have? And if possible, illustrate your response with graphs and tables, well-documented. ; Since one litre = 1000cm^3,   We can construct a cylindrical container with surface area S = 2pir^2 +2pirh.(I am using pi since I don' t have the greek symbol.)  We wish to minimize S subject to the constraint that V = pir^2h = 1.  Now, rewrite the equation for S as S = 2pir^2 + 2pir(1/pir^2) = 2pir^2 + 2/r).  Now, differentiate S wrt r and you get ds/dr = 4pir - 2/r^2 = 0 => r = 1/pir^2.

1,"About my last question regarding Maxwell Wheel.? ; In the Maxwell Wheel the angular velocity is w = v/r where r is the pole's radius and v is the translational velocity of the pole. But the v is also the tangential velocity of each point at the surface of the pole. So I understand that these velocities are equal (Why is that?) Furthermore, the angular velocity of the wheel is equal to the angular velocity of the pole, right? But in that case w=V/R, when V supposed to be the translational velocity of the wheel, don't it? But the translational velocities of the wheel and the pole are equal (they're falling together), so V=v,\nbut R!=r (not equal) so this is a paradox. Where am I wrong? ; ok.  call the downward translational velocity of the whole thing v.  this means that the tangential velocity at the edge of the poles (at the radius r) is equal to v.  the reason for this is that the strings are wound AROUND THE POLES, so this winding and the condition that the string has to unwrap for the thing to move, sets the angular velocity w = v/r.\n\nnow, if you look at the main wheel part, the angular velocity has to be equal to the angular velocity of the poles, since they are one solid piece.  however, as you note the radius of the wheel R > r.  so, the fact that v / r = w = V / R implies that V > v.  in other words, the motion of the outer edges of the wheel is faster than the motion of the outer edges of the rods.\n\ni think you are getting confused by saying that V is the translational velocity of the wheel.  it's not.  v is the translational velocity of the wheel, and of the rods.  the fact that the string is wound *around the rods* and not around the wheel sets the angular velocity of the whole apparatus equal to v/r.  V, the tangential velocity of the outer edges of the wheel, is much faster than the translational velocity.\n\nthat clear?",7320

8,"Guys-- why is the idea of having sex with two girls pleasurable? ; My BF told me before he could have sex with two girls- one of them being me of course.  But I cannot stand the thought of watching him having sex with another girl. This bothers me especially after vowing with each other we wouldn't have sex with other people.  Is this a product of his porn watching and wanting to experience new things? I think I give him plenty of sex and good sex too. I don't understand... ; Ok, I have to say that a lot of the answers that you have received so far are close, but none of them quite hit the mark or cover all the bases, so I am going to see what I can do here. \n First of all, I am fairly qualified here as my fiancé and I have done a threesome with both another woman and another guy, and our relationship has survived it unscathed. \n To answer the main question of why. . . There is no single answer that would apply to all men that have those desires. Yes, porn for a lot of us has glorified the threesome. Another common reason is that watching two women be intimate is quite erotic. Lets face it, they call you the ""fairer sex"" for a reason!!\n Could your BF feel pressure to please you? If so, a second person could be viewed as a helper.\n The most common reason, however, is simply the desire to have variety in ones sex life.\n Now, let's address how you should go forward. First of all, your BF shared a fantasy with you, and if you ever want him to ever do so again, you cannot react negatively to it. That does not mean that you have to do it, but you also want to avoid him feeling rejection from it.\n To help you decide if having a threesome with another woman is something you want to do, consider this:\n Are you physically attracted to women? I.E. Are you bi/bi-curious? If so, you could decide that you are will have a threesome with him with the stipulation that he and the other woman do not have sex. Set very specific boundaries, I.E. Is touching ok? Is kissing ok? Is manual stimulation ok? Etc. . . If you cannot trust him to abide by these boundaries during the heat of the moment, you do NOT want to do this!\n If you decide that you do not want to do this, explain it to him, but offer to incorporate it into your fantasy life. Say something to him like ""The idea turns me on, but I would not be ok with the reality of it"", and then bring it up in a sexy way during foreplay or lovemaking. Reiterate after you are done having sex that this is something that can only be a fantasy, never a reality. This is often the perfect compromise in these situations.\n In my experience, a man bringing this fantasy to his significant other is generally sign of developing trust, and not of impending doom. The act itself, however, has been the end of many strong relationships, so tread carefully!!",7395

8,"Really can't stand my brother's fiancee...? ; On the surface my brother's fiancee is a good person. You know, she does all the socially right things (like immediate thank you notes, volunteering to cook on family holidays, sending flowers when people have had a rough week- that type of stuff). But she's not a genuinely nice person, and I feel as though my (smart, down-to-earth, easy-going)brother is 1) being mildly controlled by this woman,2) Isn't nearly as happy as he used to be, and 3) is blind to many of her very annoying shortcomings (like the fact that she is controlling & judgemental).I feel as though I can't say anything to my brother because they are engaged; and my remarks (if not delicately phrased) could end up being a permanent scar in what may turn out to be a life-long relationship with this woman (who is petty enough to hold eternal grudges)... anyhow to say something or not to say anything- that is the question. ; I would only say something if you really feel the need to stand up for your brother, I would do it with them both standing right there so that way there is no he said she said crap going on between them talking about you. I would only do that under extreme cercumstances though. It matters how close you are over all to your brother, I mean if you can talk to him about anything i would definitally say something to him in private, something like dude is it just me or do you seem unhappy here lately, not really blameing her but if it is because of her he will come out and say so, if he asks you what you think i would go ahead and tell him but in the long and short of it if she makes him eat dog food on the floor every night for dinner and he still loves her, support him in his pick for a future wife. You might not like how she treats him over all but it looks like he does, maybe you havent gotten to know her well enough yet, Or maybe he hasnt, who knows. But i would definitally deal with this in a tender way, maybe your mom or dad can say something to him, or you can go to them and voice your concerns, they could probably get away with saying something to him easier then you could. I dont know ive never really been in that situation but i can see it going bad easily if its not delt with care :) I hope that helps",7400

4,"How do I get my wireless connection to work? ; I have a Linksys 2.4 GHz, 54 Mbps router, model WRT54G.  My wireless card is a Netgear 54 Mbps PCI Adapter WG311 v3.  I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

I would love to hear from those who have served as probably only you know the answer to this one. ; I believe support is needed for good morale.  The louder the better!\n\nMost people don't recognize the best method of support, which is a letter and telephone call to your Congressman and Senators.\n\nI am a Vietnam War veteran, and remember the lack of support during that period.  To this day I greet the vision of Hanoi Jane Fonda on TV with a long diatribe of profanity!\n\nI once spoke with General Westmoreland, who said American soldiers never lost a battle of any significance during the Vietnam War - that Congress lost the war due to their indifference and lack of support.\n\nLastly, I firmly believe anti war rhetoric (by individual citizens and POLITICIANS) offers nothing more than encouragement and hope to our enemies.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal (August 3, 1995) published an interview with Bui Tin who served on the General Staff of the North Vietnam Army and received the unconditional surrender of South Vietnam on April 30, 1975.  During the interview  Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory.  Mr. Tin responded ""It was essential to our strategy""  referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets.  He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts ""to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement."" \nPS:  U.S. Army retired",7434

Even through the dense jungle they could see the ruins of ancient temples and rock carvings.  Around them, the parrots were squwaking and the tropical flowers were beaded with morning dew.\n\nSomething was beckening them to venture deeper . . . ; it wasn't a voice, it was the sensations felt by millions of pilgrims to the site, drawing them to their God.  As they drew nearer, the sensations of peace deepened and the awe of the place grew tenfold.  Gazing up at the majestic ruins, they sensed the magnitude of the culture and peoples that built it.  As they wandered through the empty streets, they could hear the whispers of street vendors, of the carts being drawn and the animals bawling out their myriad of sounds.  They kept feeling the draw and the presence of something unseen, urging them deeper within the ruins.  \nAs they neared a building that was left virtually unscathed, they noticed the fine craftsmanship on the building and the magnitude of their emotions blossomed.  They approached it with baited breath and entered with reverence.  All around a central altar, benches circled the entire building.  Above the altar was a simple cross and a few words in the ancient tongue, etched in the stone below.  \nAfter struggling with the translations, they discovered the meaning.  It read simply, ""All who seek peace, may find it here"".  All of a sudden, they were filled with a glorious peace, that filled their entire being, and they knew that they had found the ancient God the natives had worshiped, and their own.",7444

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486
9,"Why no spotlight on democrat vote fraud? ; In 2000 the democrat party and broadcasters ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC conspired to steal electoral votes of the state of Florida for Al Gore. They deliberately called Florida early for Gore when the voting booths in the Panhandle (which is more conservative than the rest of Florida) were still open. This cost Bush up to 30000 votes and also the electoral votes of the state of New Mexico. It is estimated that many republican voters stayed at home after hearing the media call Florida for Gore because they assumed Bush had already lost. And also, the democrats tried to have a selective recount in hand picked counties, votes to be counted by different standards.\n\nIn 2004 there was once again massive fraud in democrat controlled areas in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Detroit, St.Louis, Chicago, Milwaukee and particularly Washington state, where the democrats stole the election for governor. In 2002 democrats in South Dakota stole the election for Senate.\n\nWhy is there no spotlight on this? ; By the way, you forgot the Democratic theft of the 2004 Washington gubernatiorial election (so ably documented at ""SoundPolitics.com"")\n\nYou suggested a large part of the reason in your opening: ""the broadcasters. . .conspired. . . ""  \n\nWell, I'm not too sure ""conspired"" is the right word, at least not for most of them.  (It really only take a few conspirators; the rest may be quite unwitting accomplices.)    The basic reason, I believe, is that the media simply has deep CONVICTIONS (or bias!) that it is not able to overcome (perhaps because they are not able/willing to recognize they ARE biased).\n\nLet's face it -- the Old Media is largely on the political left, whereas talk radio, for instance, is mainly on the right.  The PROBLEM is that talk radio, right bloggers, etc. ANNOUNCE their bias --'this is where we're coming from'.  But the liberal Old Media, by its very inability (refusal?) to simply admit IT is biased to the left, blinds itself to self-critique and correction.\n\nFor the Old Media it is extremely difficult to recognize and highlight fraud by the party they are overwhelmingly sold out to (not literally but in their personal convictions!) ... to admit that people who share their convictions COULD do such... it's too much for them.\n\nConsider also that there are leading Democrats who often go out of their way to leak, plant and spin stories in the sadly unsuspecting press, which rarely thinks to stop to question the motivation of those critcizing or accusing the right.   And the sheer constancy (in number and repetition) of ACCUSATIONS -- no matter how ill-founded-- can, over time, start giving people the impression (without any evidence!) that ""there must be something to it"".  The MSM is here both perpetrator and victim.  \n\nAgain, I DO hesitate to call MOST of this ""conspiracy"" -- I believe many in the media (and in the Democratic party as well) are quite sincere.  Before anything even happens, they are already so convinced that the Democrats are right, that Republicans not the Dems would SURELY be the ones to try to 'disenfranchise' voters that it makes them simply incapable of SEEING things happening under their very noses  (and if they are sometimes forced to admit it in this or that instance, they still operate from the deep CONVICTION [almost religious!] that this is an aberration, whereas the Republicans really are committed to using any means, fair or foul, to win... even when NO evidence of it can be discovered.\n\nCompounding this is the fact that much of the liberal media IS living in a ""bubble"" -- they are hardly exposed to anyone who thinks or sees things differently from them. (There is, in a sense, an advantage to being on the right -- you can hardly escape being hit with the spin of the left.  Many on the left can almost if not completely avoid being exposed to people of conviction on the right... so they simply do not understand them.) There is very little diversity, for instance, in their news rooms, no one to ask the key questions or point out the problems that are OBVIOUS to intelligent commentators on the right.\n\nAs evidence of this sort of deep conviction, note that other answers you are getting!

The article was about making a patch work quilt in your mind with the people in your life that have the qualities that you would want in a mother or father. Say you have a friend who is really good at listening, that can be a piece of what a mom is to you. Someone else in your life who encourages you is another part of what a mom is to you and slowly you piece together a mother. Instead of getting all of a mom in one person many people end up fill the void that is empty. It will never be the same as the real thing but that is where acceptance is a huge part of learning to cope. You will always miss them and wonder what life would be like with them.

I think I was the last person that knew he was gay.  I am sure it's denial that I've been in; nonetheless, I felt somehow that I needed to show him that I care and understand...and accept him no matter what.  How does one show that when presented with new lifestyle?  I told him that I could attend groups that support gays and was advising him to hang out with other gays so no one picks fun of him.  It may sound ridiculous but its just a mother making sure her child is ""safe.""  We may accept and understand but we know others do not and we just want to protect ours.\n\nSo you could really sit down with your mother and explain to her that you pretty much know what you want to do but let her know you appreciate her attempts to help you.  You can reassure her that you are not depressed, that you are also not bipolar.  \n\nSometimes when a parent doesn't understand (or accept readily), we think something else is the cause.

2,"what can a person take to control cough? ; Without taking a perscription drug. ; HI BARB\n\nHere is the cause and a remedy for you.\n\nCause \nThis is often caused by a stomach disorder that comes from overloading the system with food, wherein fermentation in the stomach causes phlegm. It may also be induced by inflammation in the bronchial tubes due to a neglected cold. Worms may be the cause. Many coughs are from a nervous condition, where coughing may eventually become habitual. Coughs are highly misunderstood. Usually a sore throat and coughing are caused by the sinuses draining the eustachian tubes, which is like pouring acid down the throat. A cough usually comes from a lowered vitality in the system from improper diet, loss of sleep, lack of exercise, and fresh air, improper breathing, poor elimination, or improper night clothing and bedding. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1. Acute coughs can often be relieved with a little honey and onion syrup. When it is the result of an old acute condition, clear out the morbid condition as rapidly as possible without causing irritation. In old cough conditions, comfrey with vervain or mullein are very good. The antispasmodic tincture is also excellent, and it is good to massage the chest area across the back with an antispasmodic tincture during attacks of spasms. Antispasmodic tincture may be used both internally and externally as a liniment on the throat. If this is due to a neglected cold, any of the diaphoretic herbs are excellent. To relieve the coughing spasms, use horehounds, comfrey, or a small amount of lobelia. High enemas of herbal laxatives will relieve congestion of the bowels, and if the cough is severe (asthma, whooping cough) load the stomach with liquids and induce vomiting. \n\nBest of health to you\n\nCheers",7531

I can't  find a boiling point for it ... if it even has one. ; How hot do you have to heat a green leaf before it turns brown indicating  the chlorophyll is destroyed? ; Chlorophyll is a rather complex and most of all large molecule, which means that the pure substance will be a solid.   In a leaf the chlorophyll is in solution.\n\nLeaves turning brown most likely involves encymatic digestion of parts of the molecule. The core construction of chlorophyll is quite hardy - a flat system of five- or six-atom rings with a central magnesium ion held in place by nitrogen atoms pointing to it in a square. (Hemoglobine and one of the vitamins have a similar basic structure, hemoglobine with iron in the centre and the vitamin with cobalt.)\n\nYou can dry a leaf and keep the chlorophyll intact at temperatures up to 120°C without any browning effect. Such a dried leaf will remain green, unlike a wet leaf where encymatic digestion will destroy the pigment.\n\nThe leaf will turn brown at temperatures where paper also begins to turn brown - when the cellulosis of the plant cells begins to split off water. This may start around 451°F...",7538

The standard TIdTCPServer component should suffice to build a simple chat application.  The client application would use the TIdTCPClient component.  The most direct method is to work out some standard commands, and assign them to the server's CommandHandlers property.  It would also be useful to work out some standard response codes so the client knows what the server is doing.\n\nWhen chat messages are sent (for example through a SendCmd call to TIdTCPClient), you simply have the CommandHandler on the server read the incoming text (OnCommand for the CommandHandler) the iterate the clients (TIdTCPServer.Bindings) and Write the text to the connections.  The clients can periodically call ReadLn (during a timer event) to check to see if the server sent any chat messages.\n\nThings to keep in mind:\nOn the server, each client connects using it's own thread, so you have to have some familiarity with thread synchronization.\n\nIf you're planning to use the chat server over the Internet, you should have a cursory understanding of how firewalls work (e.g. port blocking) in case clients can't connect to your server.\n\nUltimately, there should be some examples in you Indy install directory or in your Delphi demos directory.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nHope this helps.",7560

1,"Help on Trigonometry, please? ; You are at the top of a buidling 418 ft tall. As you look down at anearby smaller buidling, you observe that the angle of depression of the base is 77 degrees and the angle of depression of the top is 46 degrees.  Find the hegiht of the smaller building and the horizontal distance between the two buildings. ; Trigonometry is hard to do in you head, so start out by making a drawing. You have two buildings A (tall) and B (short) - Draw them far apart, not like this:\n\nA         B\n|         \n|         \n|    \n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n|         |\n\nNow draw one line from the top of A to the top of B - this is the angle of depression of the top and it is 46 degrees. That is, if you drew a straight, horizontal line across the top of building A, the angle between that line and the line joining the top of A to the top of B is 46 degress.\n\nSimilarly, draw a line from the top of A to the *bottom* of B - this is the angle of depression of the bottom and it is 77 degrees. That is, the angle between the horizontal line across the top of A, and the line between top of A and bottom of B is 77 degrees.\n\nNow can you find out the angle between the line from A-top to B-top, and the line from A-top to B-bottom? (It's very important for you to draw this!) Let's put this value aside for a minute. \n\nLooking at your drawing, can you see that you know the value for *part* of the angle between the horizontal line across A's top and length of building A? What is that part you know? Now, see how the line across A's top and length of A make a right angle? So how many degrees in a right angle? So if you know the total of that angle, and part of that angle, how do you get the other part? **Notice that this part we're trying to get is actually the angle between the line A-top to *B*-bottom, and the line A-top to *A*-bottom. \n\nYou should also notice that now we have two triangles:\nTriangle 1: A-top to B-bottom to A-bottom. Solve this triangle for line A-bottom to B-bottom for distance between the two buildings.\nTriangle 2: A-top to B-top to B-bottom. Solve this triangle for line B-top to B-bottom for height of building. \n\nDon't forget, we have two important angles that will help solve these two triangles!",7575
6,"How to survive Starbucks? ; I have a small coffee &#92; espresso business.  Starbucks is flooding the town I serve with its businesses, 17 of them to date with more coming.  My product is good, but my resources are now limited and deminishing.  How can I survive them? ; The key to beating an establishment like Starbucks is to be unique and creative. You need to offer a service, product, or an entertainment that Starbucks does not have.\nI'm going to give you four examples of low cost ways to increase your business and traffic.\n\n1) It's rare for Starbucks to have live music. You can find decent acts that will work for almost nothing. They need promotion too and a place to perform and many people will be willing to do it for free or low cost. If you don't want to spend money on acts you can provide an open mic night to draw customers in. The key is to create buzz. If you hire an act they will tell their friends, family, and fans to come see them perform and this will bring a TON of traffic to your store. People will remember your coffee shop and come back.\n\n2) You might want to add art from local artists and hang them up for sale on the walls. People will come visit your store to see what new works are up and the artists will also bring in his friends, family, and fans to come see their work. Rotate different artists every few weeks to keep people coming back and to increase the variety of people coming into your store.\n\n3) Offer free wireless internet. Starbucks offers wifi but T-mobile charges a hefty $30 a month per customer. Wireless internet is a little expensive but not enough to break the bank. This will draw in more customers and will also KEEP the customers in your coffee shop for much longer. The busier your store looks the more appealing it becomes. People will realize that more customers means more turnover which means fresher coffee. I would totally go to your store and spend every morning there if I knew I got some free internet.\n\n4) Treat your customers exceptionally well. Coffee shops are about return business. Treat your loyal customers well and they will return to you every morning and will start bringing in their friends. Give customers a few low cost freebies and taste tests. They will definitely remember your generosity. \n\nI hope that helps a bit!\n\n~Mark Lim\n\nhttp://www.poisonappleshirts.com",7576

8,"Wedding+Distance=Crazy difficult. Ideas? ; My fiance and I are facing an issue with planning a wedding.\nWe live in the lower peninsula of Michigan (Cadillac, if you want to mapquest it or something). My friends and immediate family are local to us currently, as well as 2 hours to the south. His family and closest friends, however, are located in the upper peninsula, close to Wisconsin--about an 8 hour drive. The problem this presents is: Where should we have our wedding? If we did it in one place or the other, it would obviously be difficult for the side furthest away. The idea of doing it somewhere in the middle is possible, but I've been involved in planning two weddings, and I would not look forward to the added difficulty of planning one 3 or 4 hours from the venue.\n   Luckily, our engagement shall be long, so we're not tied to any sort of real deadline right now. Even so, we'd like to work out some solutions before it the date is dangerously close. Anyone who has been through a similar situation, or simply has some ideas? ; Not sure how much money you have budgeted for your wedding, but how about getting married at Castle Farms up in Charlevoix, MI.  I personally have never been there, but the pictures on the website are just beautiful.  You can have both the ceremony and the reception in the same place.  It's about 2 hours north of Cadillac.  You can even go on a virtual tour on the site.  Check it out: http://www.castlefarms.com/index.cfm\n\nIf you don't want to go with a full service place like this somewhere in the middle, I would just recommend having it locally.  It will make your life a whole lot easier.  Most everyone had to drive about 2 hours to get to my wedding.  I probably should have had it over in Muskegon/Grand Haven, where most of my family lives, but I just loved the place I found in Battle Creek.  Plus I live in Battle Creek and it just made my life easier.  \n\nIf you have it far away you will have to transport all of your supplies to that location.  Could be difficult and what if you forget something.  If I forgot something I only need to drive or have someone drive about 10-15 minutes to get it.  So I would think about that in your decision too.\n\nCongratulations! And Good Luck!",7592

In your heart you know that you want to be a Freemason.  Because the fraternity does not evangelize in any way we never ask anyone to become a Mason.  Every member has joined of his own freewill and has not been persuaded to become a member.  Your own Grandfather followed this rule and never asked you to join his lodge.\n\nSearch out the most respected members of your community and you will find that they are probably Freemasons.  Tell your desire to one of these men and he will secure for you a petition to the lodge.  A committee of inquiry will call on you at your home to make sure that your desires are true,  that you are a respected member of the community and worthy to become a Mason.   If the committee approves of you; the entire lodge will be notified and you must pass a unanimous ballot.  If any member of the lodge feels that you are unworthy; you will never become a member of the lodge as long as the objection exists.\n\nAs a member you will be part of the world's oldest and greatest fraternity.  You will find charitable needs and causes, education, fellowship, and friendship.  One of the greatest gifts a man can give to another is to help him become a Mason.

They also have two empty jars, one holding five quarts, the other three. How can they each measure exactly 4 quarts of water? \n \nHow would one go about solving this mathematically?(Please explain clearly) ; (Edit: Assume we always pour from the 8 to the 5, from the 5 to the 3, and from the 3 back to the 8. Let k be the number of times 5 quarts is poured from 8 quart jug into the 5 quart jug and k is also the number of times 3 quarts is poured from the 3 quart jug back into the 8 quart jug. Then to end up with 4 quarts in the 8 quart jug we must have:8-k(5-3)=4 so k=2.  In order for there also to be 4 quarts left in the 5 quart jug we must have 5k (i.e. the number of times the 5 quart jug is filled) -3k (the number of times the 3 is emptied into the 8) =4. That is 5k-3k=4. k(5-3)=4. k=2. Since k=2 in both cases, we have a solution.)\n\nIt actually has a fairly simple logical/mathematical solution.\nCall the jugs: J3, J5 and J8\nYou will have to end up with 4 quarts in J8 and 4 quarts in J5\nwith no outside water supply so there can be no spillage.\n\nThere is no sense in filling both J3 and J5 from J8.\nSo fill J5 from J8, and then fill J3 from J5. After this, J5 will have 2 Qs left in it. This could be poured back into J8, but let's see what happens if we complete a J8-J5-J3-J8 cycle (by filling J5 from J8 then J3 from J5 and then pouring J3 back into J8)  In doing so we must end up with 8-5+3 = 6 Qs in J8, and there will be 8-6 = 2 Qs in J5. Now, if you complete another round without first moving the 2 Qs in J5 to J3 then you will get the same result as in the first round(since you'll just be moving 3 Qs around in a circle). However, if the 2 Qs in J5 are poured into J3 before beginning the next round then you must end up with 6-5+3 = 4 Qs in J8 after the 2nd round. And since the round ends by emptying J3, the remaining 4 quarts must be in J5, which is the desired result. Stepwise, it is goes as follows.\n\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere are now 3 Qs in J8, 2Qs in J5 and 3 Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8 \nPour J5 into J3\nThere are now 6 Qs in J8 and 2Qs in J3\nFill J5 from J8\nFill J3 from J5\nThere is now 1 Q in J8, 4 Qs in J5 and 3Qs in J3\nPour J3 into J8\nThere are now 4 quarts in both J8 and J5\n\n.",7629

1,"How to tell which compound would likely dissolve in water or gasoline? ; I have a quick question and would like some tips as to how to tell a compound as to whether it would dissolve more in water or gasoline. Such as Choloroform(CHCl3), Na2SO4, KCl, and BaSo4\n\nI would greatly appreciate anyone's help with this! ; We've to get this clear first. Water is a polar solvent, gasoline is a non-polar solvent. By the principal of like-dissolves-like, polar molecules will dissolve in water, for example, NaCl; while non-polar molecules will dissolve in gasoline, for example, fats, phosholipids, alkanes, alkenes etc.\n\nFor the question you've asked,\nChloroform is a polar compund because Cl draws electrons from the carbon center and making Cl atoms have a higher concerntration of electrons. Hydrogen atoms in water carry a partially positive charge and hence are attracted to Cl molecule. Hence it is soluble in water.\n\nNa2SO4 is soluble in water. This is because it is actually 2 Na+ ions attached to SO4(2-) ions. Na+ ions get attracted to oxygen atoms in water which has a partially negative charge and SO4(2-) ions gets attracted to hydrogen atoms in water which has a partially positive charge.\n\nKCL is soluble in water because Cl atoms draws electrons from K. Follow the same reasoning as chloroform.\n\nFor BaSO4, it is insoluble in water. Only barium nitrate dissolves in water. Other barium salts do not.\n\nHope this helps! =)",7637

It sucks, and no one wants to go through it. Well let me re-phrase that, normal people don't want to go through it. But that is why it is at times necessary, not everyone is normal. Occasionally you get a bad guy or group who wants to dominate people by fear and torture.

Yes war also means death to innocent people and harm and danger to the good forces who fight for the pure cause.

I cut and paste some info I found.  I sent my Titleist Rep an e-mail asking the same question.  I will send you the info.  \n\nGolf balls travel farther when they are warm.\nSomewhat true. Colder temperatures do decrease a ball's velocity more than warm temperatures; although, the air temperature affects distance much more significantly than the temperature of the ball. The moral of the story is don't bother putting the ball in the oven before teeing off. Your pocket will do just fine. A two-piece ball will have a little faster initial velocity off the clubface in cold weather, so keep that in mind next time the frost is on the ground. \n\nThe weather report also influences which ball to choose. Warm conditions can expand balls, calling for players to use a higher compression. A harder ball helps in high humidity or in low sea level areas, where thick air slows the ball down. \n\nConversely, cold weather tends to harden the ball. Players can counteract the effect by choosing lower compression balls. Softer balls also help in high altitudes where air is thinner and there is less resistance",7666

3,"Social Class Structure of Chile? ; How many social class?, how much they earn? please ; Today Chile’s social structure can be roughly divided into three classes. In the upper class are members of the old landed aristocracy as well as a more recently wealthy group of industrialists, merchants, politicians, and military men. Although these two segments of the upper class have power and prestige in common, they are often at odds politically and economically. Both groups supported the imposition of military rule, but by the end of the 1980s many backed the restoration of democratic politics.\n\nChile’s lower class consists of farm laborers, crafts workers, factory workers, and miners. This is the class that backed Salvador Allende’s coalition before 1973, that suffered the most from the policies of the military regime, and that again turned to left-wing parties after the end of military rule in 1990. Sharply falling real wages—wages calculated in terms of buying power—from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s increased the size of this group. Government policy in the 1990s and early 2000s endeavored to improve the health and education of this neglected part of the population.\n\nThe middle class, largely urban, is extremely varied in incomes, occupations, and interests. It is composed of professionals, teachers and university professors, civil servants, many private employers, and some small merchants, industrialists, and investors. Many members of the middle class benefited from Chile’s rapid economic growth in the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s. Politically, members of the middle class participate in all parties.\n\nSocial mobility has been high in Chile, and upward social movement has been common. The period of military rule in the late 1900s at first appeared to be simply reactionary and traditionalist. But the free-market economic policies that it adopted ultimately led to increased social mobility.",7672

1,"why is momentum important in physics? ; I personally don't think that momentum is particularly important, but if so, why is it important in physics? ; Momentum is the direct result of the following Newtonian Law of Inertia\nAny object in motion remains in motion and any object at rest remains at rest (unless a net force acts upon the object)\nMomentum (p) is the mass (m) of the object times its velocity (v).\np = mv\n\nForce (F) and Newtons Second Law can be derive from a change in momentum.

It took me 7 years to pay them, and I made accelerated payments when I could.  7 years paying up to $400 a month is a real dent in your standard of living, and that was only for $10,000!  Nowadays people come out owing a lot more than that.  Try this instead:\n\nThere are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships.

They will worship and adore you and support your needs. After a while it gets a little too mushy sometimes, but some Leo gals are into mushy. If Aquarius guys are too soft for your tastes, I reccomend Aries guys. Bold, and solid, and give a gal a run for her money, especially if you like the smart aleck type arguing. Gemini are terrible for Leo gals, very little in common, and frustrating for a leo. Hard for Leo's to understand. Stay far far away from Libras, they will annoy you to no end. Pices will end you in ruin and heartache. If you are up for a serious challenge Taurus or Virgo, but you better have you own life in order first before taking either of those on. Cancer guys are good for gals who want someone to take care of. Sensitive and compassionate, but not the boldest creatures. The rest are kinda neutral, not great, but not terrible. \nAnd of course there are Leo guys. A handfull and a half. Passionate in ups and in downs, but compatible in interests, and easier to understand than other guys. \n\nIt all depends on what you are looking for.

2,"can I call different dentists to get an estimate on a root canal? ; I went to the dentist and was told I would need a root canal and crown. I believe his fee is very high. I was wondering if I could get estimates from other dentists. Is it ok to call around and ask what other dentists would charge for the same procedure? ; No you can't call around and get a quote on a root canal from different dentists.  It's not like buying car insurance. You will not be able to get a price from a dentist without him/her seeing you first. By law they can not quote you a price for a procedure without seeing you first. It's the same thing as calling a Dr. you've never seen before and asking them to diagnose your problem over the phone. It can't be done. There are many types of root canals and they all cost different prices. It also depends on what tooth it is and what kind of crown the dentist will put on it. Most people think there's a set fee for this type of procedure but that isn't the case. It is a case by case scenario and if you feel like the price is too high at your current dentist I reccomend getting a copy of your xray and getting a second opinion.  Normally for a root canal and a crown you are looking at spending around $900 for both. Of course, if you have insurance then the price would be drastically less.  Some dentists have payment plans/options and I would look into that if you are paying cash for this. Good luck, I have had a root canal and crown myself and it's not fun!",7732

1,"Physics Collision and Impulse? ; Basilisk lizards can run across the top of a water surface.  With each step, a lizard first slaps its foot against the water and then pushes it down into the water rapidly enough to form an air cavity around the top of the foot.  To avoid having to pull the foot back up against the water drag in order to complete the step, the lizard withdraws the foot before water can flow into the air cavityIf the lizard is not to sink, the average upward impulse on the lizard during this full action of slap, downward push, and withdrawal must match the downward impulse due to the gravitational force.  Suppose the mass of the basilisk lizard is 90.0 g, the mass of each foot is 3.00 g, the speed of a foot as it slaps the water is 1.50 m/s, and the time for a single step is 0.600 s. \n\n(A) What is the magnitude of impulse on the lizard during slap?

9,"Why don't liberals get upset about Clinton authorizing illegal wiretaps & searches during his time in office? ; Found the following while messing around on the web:\n\n\nhttp://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-271.html\n\n\nThe Clinton administration claims that it can bypass the warrant clause for ""national security"" purposes. In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part. Hmmm. Seems to be missing from the site you posted as well.\n\nFirst, if trying to construct an argument, you may want to pull facts from something other than a conservative spin house. By the way, the same goes for liberals. I'm tired of seeing people posting links to places of strong bias.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to this. The part your missing is when Clinton got the smack layed down on him.\n\nYou see, he had the authority in 1993 but he didn't use it  (or get caught rather) until a few years later. When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this. At least, amongst the people I knew then (many of them liberals).\n\nMy view on the whole thing is to get rid of it. It's to dangerous in the hands of the executive, especially when said executive has granted himself to power to declare whether or not someone is an enemy.\n\nI don't want to see ANYONE with that power. Period. It goes against everything this country stands for.\n\n~X~",7775

Please help! ; Id be curious to know whats causing the anxiety. As for the nausea, I used to get that after being dehydrated. \n  With most anxiety there is an increase in heart rate and an increase in the metabolism often with unpleasant side effects (insulin problems, nausea, dizziness from dehydration).

If I was you, I would think about what you want to say first, so you don't get all tongue tied when the big moment comes.  Make sure she's not surrounded by a bunch of her friends, that's gonna be pressure!\n\nMaybe you could give her a flower (maybe not a rose, that's a bit too romantic initially) and tell her that you admire her and ask her if she'd like to go on a date sometime.  Don't make her answer on the spot - give her a piece of paper with your ph number written on it and invite her to give you a call if she would like to go out.\n\nGood luck - and remember to smile and act confident, even if you feel like the ground is swallowing you up.\n\nPS  Girls like shy guys (the right ones for you anyway)",7838

Or are you asking whether you can apply to two different programs at the same time.  The former is likely yes for UIUC. However, the latter may not be.

4,"What are the differences between a Computer Engineer, a  Computer Programmer, and a Software Engineer? ; I like working in a text enviroment, writing code, and not in a What You See What You Get enviroment. I am interested in a field that creates the necessary software required to make computers work, like operating systems, and am really confused about the fields I mentioned above. I just want to know their differences so that I can decide which field to pursue.\n\nThank You for your help ; In many markets the terms programmer and software engineer are used interchangeably.\n\nTechincally, a Software Engineer is someone who has a degree in Computer Science (usually from an engineering college). A software engineer studies programming, system architecture, database theory, and other computer-related topics. \n\nA person who possesses these same skills, even without such a degree, and who has worked for a period of time in this role might also be called a software engineer. It is up to the hirer to determine if this person has the necessarey skills.  Often, proven industry experience is enough. This is why job requirements often read ""Software Engineer Wanted - BS or MS in Computer Science or 8+ years demonstrated experience"".\n\nA Computer Programmer is someone that knows how to write programs in a specific language. He/she may or may not have the systems architecture, operating systems, and database training and skills that a Software Engineer has. And those skills may not be required. \n\nThere is no such common title as Computer Engineer in the US. This is typically what someone who does not understand the business mught call someone in the business. Ex. ""My nephew is a computer engineer"" conveys that the nephew is in the business but does actually describe the role.",7855

But if you are unable to use it effectively (such as being unable to finish lay-up's), it becomes more of a hindrance than a strength.  I feel that your concern may not be your strength, rather how you execute your lay-up's.  As a basketball coach, the first thing that is taught to players is that missing lay-up's is a no-no!  That's an easy two and there is no excuse to miss them.  I suggest that when you practice on your own and you miss a lay-up, run a lap from courtside to courtside.  This will serve as a reminder to you not to miss them in the future and the drill also builds your conditioning.",7912

The fact of the matter is that no woman wants to run for president other than hillary. The thing is, women in politics are much more scarce as the field is primarily run by males and it is hard for women to get into a position that could win them the election.\n\nThus far, due to Hillary's presidential background, she is the best woman candidate thus far and the democractic party sees this as a means to run a tough race that might get her elected.\n\nPolitical parties aren't going to vouch for anyone (nominate them for presidency) if they don't think they'll be a viable asset to the party. Typically, parties as a whole will nominate for three reasons: They're easy to use as a pawn, they'll have an easy victory with the people, or they're an all around great person. The chances of the last are rare, and its normal to nominate people that can be viewed by the U.S. Voters as a good vote. This ensures a party victory, and normally the executive office will be run more by the president's cabinet and other party officials through the president. It's also helpful for the nominee to be easily controled by the party as a whole to ensure that the political party's needs and wants are met.",7961

5,"when was the first time someone used a snowboard and what country or if in usa what state.? ; please answer this correctly it for a school assiment. ; Did you know that the first of the snowboards goes back all the way to 1929? Back then they has skis, but the first person to come up with the idea of a snowboard was a man named M.J. ""Jack"" Burchett. He cut out a plank of plywood and tried to stick his feet to the wood with the help of some clothes and horse reins. It was over 30 years after Burchett that the next step was taken towards the evolution of snowboards. In 1965, Sherman Poppen, a chemical gases engineer in Muskegon invented the “The Snurfer”. The name was given by his wife. He came up with the “The Snurfer” in order to entertain his daughter. He made the Snurfer by putting two skis together and putting a rope at the nose so that the rider could hold it and keep it stable. Many of his friends were interested in this Snurfer and that inspired him into licensing his idea to a manufacturer. The Snurfer sold over half a million in 1966 but was only seen as a toy for kids, not something serious enough for adult entertainment. Poppen organized competitions in order to make the Snurfer even more poppular. Jake Burton was really into the Snurfer and participated in the competitions organized by Poppen. Since Burton’s parents wouldn’t buy him a board and let him surf, he amused himself with the Snurfer. He was also very into skiing alongside the Snurfer, but he broke his collarbone in a car accident and couldn’t participate in ski competitions anymore. Meanwhile, a college student, &#92;Dimitrije Milovich started making snowboards in 1969. He came up with the idea after sliding down with a cafeteria plate in College. He started his own company in 1972 with the name “Winterstick”. He got reviewed on Newsweek and Playboy, which increased the popularity of snowboards. Although he left the business in 1980, he is still recognised as one of the most important pioneers in developing snowboards. In 1977, Burton, after graduating from NYU moved to Vermont and started producing new versions of the Snurfer which he still remembered from childhood. He came up with the first binding and he amazed people when he won the Snurfer competition with his very own board with the bindings on it.",7967

Wear a pad. Thats what im wearing now, Don't worry. I knew about this WAAAAY before you but we learn at diffrent ages. don't be afraid to ask your mother or another female. Even a dad or uncle is ok too. I don't get alot of cramps but I usually sleep for awhile. I have PMS thats pre menstral syndrome. That means im irritated and have symptoms earlier. Don't wear tampons at your age either. Stick with pads unless your parents say somthing. In school try to be the same as usual. You also might bloat. If period symptoms get in the way get some midol. (sp?) Also when wearing a pad try to stay away from swimming or somthing like that. For sleeping use overnight pads. If you don't have any use a normal pad and put a dark towel under you. Stay away from light clothing. If it gets stained it'll be seen like white on black. During your period wear red,dark blue,black etc. So if its stained its hard to notice. If you ever see a red stain on your pants then welcome to the woman race. Also if you have vaginal discharge (White creamy stuff) on that 'area' Then its close to coming. Be prepared. Trust me I found out I had mine because I wore a white nightgown to bed that night. I didn't know it was there until my mom literally yelled it to me infront of my brother. So if you get yours tell her. Don't make her have to shout it like its the fourth of July.  You may also get some other hormones around this time like starting to like boys. You don't have to wonder 'What the heck? I like a boy!' like I did. But don't let it get outta hand. All a period is is when an egg dies inside you. It bleeds and thats what causes a period. It isn't just blood. It can be tiny little clots of it too. This is normal to have. A period should last from 3 to 10  days. You should only get it once a month. Light or heavy be prepared. For light periods get To-Go pads instead of using a big pad. For heavy ones get thick pads. for inbetween use normal. Try to relax during a period too. Don't overdo it either. If you do you get irritated and snap at people and don't mean to. I did this alot and got into trouble. Save yourself a lecture and don't overdo it and relax. Bring a small bag to school in your backpack or somthing and put in extra underwear and pads or tampons if thats what your parents want you to use. You'll thank yourself if you do that so you don't make it public cause somtimes people are busybodies and try to see what you're doing. Do this if you are embarrased about asking for a pad at school from your male/female teacher. But don't be they do this all the time.\n\n\nIf you wanna talk email me at:\n\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nOR use IM\n\nYIM\nqueen_zelda2002@yahoo.com\n\nMSN\nsatinfairy@bellsouth.net\n\nAIM\nsatinfairy",7979

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",8087

If you have low thyroid...here's a great question to answer: Can you see the floor of your house? That was what was asked of me at one point, and to my amazement, the answer was no!\nAnyway, the signs are:fatigue and lack of energy. Women suffering from underactive thyroid experience heavier menstrual periods. Sluggishness and forgetfulness are symptoms of underactive thyroid problem. Other symptoms of this thyroid disorder are dry skin and hair and constipation.\nIf you have high thyroid, or an overactive one, the signs are: increased body metabolism. This is followed by weight loss and excessive warmth and sweating. Persons suffering from overactive thyroid experience trembling hands, irritability and rapid heartbeat or palpitations. Women with overactive thyroid or hyperthyroidism may experience shorter or lighter menstrual periods.\nI take medication, and sadly will have to take 1 pill everyday for the rest of my life. There's a blood check that they will do to see if you have low or high. I hope i've helped you!!",8151

In my opinion, the cockiest actor would be Jack Nicholson.  Don't get me wrong, as an actor I love him but as a person i know he has been and can be pretty shoddy.  The most kind and caring (and handsome) to me is Paul Newman!  he is very down to earth, been married to same person, does lots of charity work, and never had anything bad said about him.  eveyone who knows him says he is phenominal! ; I was fortunate enough to be able to work as an extra on many shows and met A LOT of actors...\nI have to say Eddie Murphy was one of the meanest people I ever has the misfortune of working with. While filming a movie, people were lining up to see him for 3-4 hours before he got there. When he arrived he put his head down and ran with his hand covering his face so these poor people who buy his tickets at the theater, who had been waiting to see him for hours, were robbed of the ""privledge"" of seeing him. How hard is it to look around for 20 seconds and wave... I mean really.......\nOn a brighter note, I have to say 2 actors ranked top of my list.\n#1) Dick Van Dyke was the best!!! He and I were chatting one day about doing theater and I swear it was like talking to your favorite uncle. He was funny, attentive, really genuine.\n#2) Ron Howard... This guy is crazy busy but when I asked him if I can take a picture of him and my daughter together, he said ""sure, no problem"" and when the flash didn't go off he said' Oh, your flash didn't go off, try it again""... Wow. Not, sorry no time, not too bad lady. He was really nice to my daughter (who was doing the film). He was a real, sweet man!\nWhoopie Goldberg ranks up there too... man, she was always cracking jokes. That womans energy level is sky high.\nSo I can only speak from personal experience, but those were top moments from my acting days.",8156

Sometimes they are right when they say if you love something so much you have to let it go but if it was meant to be it will come right back and this is one of those instances. So be patient and be a good Friend and you never know but don't put all your eggs in one basket, meaning if it's not meant to be , be prepared to move on and you should anyway.

5,"What are some good streches? ; I have recently started to exercise a bit more, mainly by jogging/running.  I've noticed that I get shin splints just after a little bit of doing either, and it also hurts my calf muscle too.  Can anyone suggest some good streches for me to do before jogging? ; Well shin splints occur from your main calf muscle dominating all those little muscles around your bone. To help that and to prevent it from happening again, make sure to do a lot of calf raises. These strengthen all your calf muscles and also help warm up the calf muscle. \n\nTo stretch the calf muscle, you can do a couple of different stretches. You can get into a push up position on the ground with one leg, and push the heel back and down onto the ground. Feel the stretch along the back of your calf and knee. Then switch legs. You could also stand up against a rail or fence with posts about a foot or a foot and a half away. Put one foot up against the post with the heel on the ground, and sort of sit into it until you feel the pull on the back of your calf and knee. These should loosen up your calves before you run.\n\nMuscles sometimes tighten up due to deficiencies in diet, too. Try to take in more potassium. Bananas are the healthiest way to get more potassium in your diet without all the other extra sugar and yucky stuff found in orange juice or other 'sources' of potassium. If you eat a banana an hour or two before you run, your muscles won't be as prone to tightening up.\n\nHave fun exercising! Running is awesome!",8318

1,"Next Solar System moon to be discovered after Galileo found Io, Ganymede, Europa & Callisto? When? By whom? ; Was it another moon of Jupiter? Or one orbiting another planet in the Solar System? Was it soon afterwards? Or did the Church's condemnation of Galileo's findings inhibit more research from taking place for a long time? ; Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, and after Ganymede, the second-largest moon in the Solar System. Discovered by Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer on March 25th, 1655 about 45 years later than Galielo's discovery of 7th January 1610.\n\nTwo generations later suggests to me that the church did inhibit research. Telescopes existed, and the thought that if Jupiter had moons, then Saturn might have them, too, must have occurred to the astronomers of the day, Perhaps it inhibited publication more than research? Another factor to consider is that Holland was also less under the sway of Roman Catholicism than Italy had been for Galileo.\n\nHuygens named his discovery simply Saturni Luna (Latin for ""Saturn's moon"", which can also be written Luna Saturni) (De Saturni Luna observatio nova, 1656; XV). Later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus) Lodoicea Sidera (""the stars of Louis"") to honour king Louis XIV.\n\nThe name ""Titan"" and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, wherein he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used.\n\nJupiter was the Roman equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and Saturn the Roman equivalent of Zeus' father, Cronos (Zeus' mother was Rhea, the name given to another of Saturn's moons).\n\nThe Huygens spacecraft and Cassini probe that explored Titan in 2004 were named after these two astronomers.",8345

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393
1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity.

9,"What about just border security as a starting point? ; The Senate Bill is a pork barrel.  The more closely you read it the more 'goodies' for various interest groups jump out that weren't even covered in news of the debates.  \n\nAlso, what seems to be holding it up is the guest worker/amnesty discussion.\n\nWhile this discussion continues, the border remains open.  Many have suggested that we at least pass a simple border security bill, not changing penalties or more rigidly criminalizing anyone, for now, and work the rest out at a pace that allows the hard questions to be looked at.  \n\nMe, if I actually had border security would support legalization for screened illegals. However, my concern is total numbers. Schools in border states are already foundering, and I think the guest worker program to keep wages permenantly depressed, on top of amnesty, is too much. They are trying to hard to give everyone everything without stopping to evaluate impact.\n\nWould you support border security first, then figure out the rest? ; I think this is the approach that SHOULD be taken.  How can you even consider guest worker programs or amnesty or ANYTHING, until you have a way to control the #'s?\n\nI too would be FAR more interested in considering some leniency for those here if I was convinced that they would be the LAST coming (from ANYWHERE).\n\nWe are the only country that does NOT have secured borders (and I do not just mean Mexcicans.  Several OTHER country's illegals just use Mexico as a way through.)  There are countries out there you would have NO DESIRE to even go to, let alone sneak into, and even THEY have better security.\nIf an illegal who just wants to work can sneak in, so can a terrorist.\n\nI'd be interested in knowing if anyone really doesn't want border security and if so, WHY?",8413
2,"What are kegel balls? ; Do they work? ; Incontinence device that you do excercises with.\n\nIncontinence is sometimes temporary, caused by pregnancy, a urinary tract infection, a vaginal infection, constipation or some specific medications. But incontinence can also be caused by muscular problems, changes in the pelvic region after childbirth, a hormone imbalance, or a neurologic disorder. Kegel exercises are the typical prescription whatever the case. \n\nOriginally Kegel exercises were done just by women after childbirth to rebuild the vaginal muscles and help with stress incontincence. Later Dr. Kegel discovered that muscle weakness could be found in most women over 40, causing pelvic discomfort, bladder dysfunction and sexual disturbances. From that he concluded that all women should be doing a variable resistance pelvic floor muscle exercise for their general health.\n\nMost women who just ""do"" kegels usually have minimal results due to the lack variable resistance and no feedback to determine if they are doing the exercise properly. The most common problem is contraction of the abdominal muscles at the same time as the PC muscle. When this occurs the abdominal muscles (which are bigger and stronger) push down on the pelvic floor and can actually make the problem worse. \n\nI have never used so I can't tell you firsthand.",8414

In other words, the universe must be an oscallating one; one that is caught in an infinite cycle of Big Bangs and Big Crunches. If the physics of each universe is the same as our own then after a long enough wait intellegent life will evolve on a earth-like planet. After a tremendous amount of time an intelligent being will eventually have an exact replica of your brain. Will you be reincarnated as this being? Why or why not? Also, if this universe is not closed, do you think an sufficiently advanced civilization  who has discovered this possiblity might try to somehow create enough matter to reverse the expansion of the universe so that this possiblity becomes true?

9,"British/American Politics? ; In Britain the Tory Party represents Big Business, the Labour Party says it represents the People(Debatable) And the Liberals can't make there minds up, what's the equivalent in America?. ; Good question. Anerican politics can be very complicated.\n\nGenerally, the Republican Party can be seen as the equivalent to the ""Tories"", the Democratic Party can be seen as the equivalent to Labour, although the American spectrum is a little bit more to the right. From what I've heard about the modern Liberal party, they are probably equivalent to Libertarians- although it's hard to peg your Liberal party down on the political spectrum.\n\nBut until the 1960's, it wasn't that cut and dry. The Democrats had many Conservatives in the south and elsewhere. And the Republicans had many liberals/moderates in the Northeast. The Republicans, after all, were the ones who freed the slaves during the Civil War. The Democrats, as a matter of fact, encouraged the formation of the KKK as a means of intimidating republicans(most of the Republicans in the south after the civil war were black ).\n\nBut even with those contradictions, the Democrats have almost always been perceived as more of ""the people's party"" and the Republicans have been more of a ""Pro-Business"" party.\n\nAs I said, the 60's and the Nixon ""Southern Strategy"" sort of caused a realignment. Conservatives moved to the GOP(Republican party) and liberals moved to the Democrats- although the seeds of this were already in each party, and there had been a slow drift both ways throughout the 20th century.",8446

After you know this, the percents of each element by mass can be calculated as follows:\n\n% of element in a compound = mass of that element ÷ mass of the compound x 100",8501

You are very wise grasshopper....Hmmmm....A product to Market?  I can think of several products that you could market.....I'll give you one....\n\nYou could market ""Countertop Water Distillers.""  I just bought one myself and I use it everyday.  A distiller turns bad tap water into pure water if you do it right.  The method is to filter your tap water through activated charcoal,  then distill it, and then filter it one more time through activated charcoal. This will pretty much give you absolute pure drinking water.  I paid about $135.00 for distiller that I bought\n\nNow....I'll go a step further and help you with your ""sales pitch.""\n\nThat fact is....there is no such thing as ""good tap water"" anymore. I don't care where you live or how good your tap water taste.  Here's the reality.....All tap water comes from either rain or snow.  The Board of Water Supply harnesses the water and adds a bunch of chemicals to it to make it safe. Then they pump it to the customers.  Right?   Ok....but......realize this....\n\nAll rain is ""Acid Rain""  There is so much pollution in our atomshere that it doesn't matter where you live. A lot of it comes from China, Asia, Europe and the United States. This ""Acid Rain""  or  ""Snow""  contains 100's of different harmful chemicals.\nOnce it makes contact with the ground it starts to pick up more chemicals.  Like Pesticides and Animal Feces. The water will also pick up ""Minerals.""  However they are mostly ""Depleted Minerals""  that only cause ""Gull Stones"" and  ""Kidney Stones."" \n\nFinally, the water flows to the  ""Board of Water Supply.""  Their  routine is to dump as much ""Bleach"" as it takes ...to ""override"" and ""kill"" all the other  Bacteria and Chemicals that are in the water.  Bam!  Finished Product!  Drink up! \n\nThe reason why so many people say they have good tap water where they live.... is because they have grown so used to the taste.  \n\nI thought I had good drinking water were I lived ....but....After I purchased my distiller and drank ""pure water"" for a month....I went back and tasted the water right out my tap. I could really taste the difference.  Big Time.  It was like drinking ""Swimming Pool"" water.

The defeat and capture of a major British military force in the Saratoga campaign by American revolutionary forces secured the northern American colonies from attacks out of Canada. It also convinced the rulers of France that it was worth extending the full measure of their military, political, and diplomatic support to the rebel American colonies.\n\nA force of roughly 10,000 men were trapped, mostly British regulars under General ""Gentleman Johnny"" Burgoyne. Burgoyne had advanced from French Canada in the summer of 1777 with the intention of taking Albany, New York, and cutting New England off from the rest of the colonies by seizing control of the Hudson River Valley. In the spring, the British had seized colonial forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga. The Americans retreated. However, a successful colonial delaying action comprising the systematic blocking of roads, destruction of bridges, and harassment of British troops with sniper fire slowed the British advance beyond the southern ends of Lakes Champlain and George to a few kilometers a day. Burgoyne's force was eventually blocked by colonial regular soldiers and militia under General Horatio Gates in the area north of the Hudson Valley town of Saratoga. Over the course of the summer, the colonial force grew to roughly 15,000 men.",8555

1,"melting glass? ; Is it possible to melt a hole in glass with a normal blow torch. ; No\nNot only does the torch not get hot enough (by ""normal"" I'm assuming a propane torch) but the flame isn't concentrated enough.  Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.  Stick with a specialized glass drill bit for that hole.",8595

My mother and two sisters have never put veils over their faces for fear that my father, myself, my little brother or other American men would punish them.  America is the strongest nation in the world.  It didn't become that by starving and kepeing poor people as peasants while it spent all it's money on building a nuclear powerhouse (in reference to N. Korea, not our dumb*** president that I didn't vote for, claiming Iraq had WMD).  N. Korean president(dictator by definition)has been building the next super-military, but if you are N.Korean you are oppressed ,very poor, and your kids have a 50/50 chance of not starving to death, unless you are in the military.  Chinese are over populated,  Africans starve and die of malaria and AIDS, Russians live in a military police society, let's not even get into Romanians and Chez.  Why rise up against your own great nation.  (we all hate Bush, somebody voted for him) ; Because that's being a real American! We aren't immune to becoming a police state, by any means.

3,"What were 3 main causes of the civil war?? ; I have a test tomorrow in social studies! ; The Civil War was caused by a myriad of conflicting pressures, principles, and prejudices, fueled by sectional differences and pride, and set into motion by a most unlikely set of political events.\n\nAt the root of all of the problems was the institution of slavery, which had been introduced into North America in early colonial times. The American Revolution had been fought to validate the idea that all men were created equal, yet slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies throughout the revolutionary period. Although it was largely gone from the northern states by 1787, it was still enshrined in the new Constitution of the United States, not only at the behest of the Southern ones, but also with the approval of many of the Northern delegates who saw that there was still much money to be made in the slave trade by the Yankee shipping industry. Eventually its existence came to color every aspect of American life.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention there were arguments over slavery. Representatives of the Northern states claimed that if the Southern slaves were mere property, then they should not be counted toward voting representation in Congress. Southerners, placed in the difficult position of trying to argue, at least in this case, that the slaves were human beings, eventually came to accept the three-fifths compromise, by which five slaves counted as three free men toward that representation. By the end of the convention the institution of slavery itself, though never specifically mentioned, was well protected within the body of the Constitution.\n\nIt seemed to Thomas Jefferson and many others that slavery was on its way out, doomed to die a natural death. It was becoming increasingly expensive to keep slaves in the agrarian society of the south. Northern and Southern members of Congress voted together to abolish the importation of slaves from overseas in 1808, but the domestic slave trade continued to flourish. The invention of the cotton gin made the cultivation of cotton on large plantations using slave labor a profitable enterprise in the deep South. The slave became an ever more important element of the southern economy, and so the debate about slavery, for the southerner, gradually evolved into an economically based question of money and power, and ceased to be a theoretical or ideological issue at all. It became an institution that southerners felt bound to protect.\n\nBut even as the need to protect it grew, the ability, or at least the perceived ability of the South to do so was waning. Southern leaders grew progressively more sensitive to this condition. In 1800 half of the population of the United States had lived in the South. But by 1850 only a third lived there and the disparity continued to widen. While northern industrial opportunity attracted scores of immigrants from Europe in search of freedom the South's population stagnated. Even as slave states were added to the Union to balance the number of free ones, the South found that its representatives in the House had been overwhelmed by the North’s explosive growth. More and more emphasis was now placed on maintaining parity in the Senate. Failing this, the paranoid theory went, the South would find itself at the mercy of a government in which it no longer had an effective voice. Never mind that slavery was protected under the constitution, and that it would have been impossible to make amendments to abolish it. Jefferson Davis, at the time a Senator from Mississippi, summed up the sectionalist argument himself. Speaking, in effect, to the people of the North concerning slavery, “It is not humanity that influences you… it is that you may have a majority in the Congress of the United States and convert the Government into an engine of Northern aggrandizement… you want by an unjust system of legislation to promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.” There, in plain English, is the shrill, accusat",8670

2,"Why do I yawn all the time, I am not even tired? ; I mean I yawn all freaking day! I cant stand it! ; THE TRUTH IS that we don’t completely understand why people, or animals for that matter, yawn. It’s widely assumed that yawning occurs because we are tired or bored or because we see someone else doing it, but there isn’t any hard evidence to support these beliefs.\n\nThe most plausible explanation, and the one that is taught in medical school, is that we yawn because oxygen levels in our lungs are low. \n\nStudies have shown that during normal, at-rest breathing, we don’t use anywhere near our lung capacity; for the most part, we just use the air sacs at the bottom of the lungs. If the air sacs, called alveoli, don’t get fresh air, they partially collapse and the lungs stiffen a bit. As a result, it’s believed, our brain prompts the body to either sigh or take a yawn to get more air into the lungs.\n\nBut certain aspects of yawning remain even more mysterious. Fetuses, for instances, have been observed yawning in the womb, yet it’s known that they don’t take oxygen in through their lungs. And yawning seems to be a symptom of multiple sclerosis and other medical conditions, for reasons unclear.\n\nAnother puzzling phenomenon is that some male animals, men included, yawn in association with penile erection (although it’s presumptuous to assume they’re bored with their sex lives).",8680

Thus tan pi/6 is 1/sqrt(3) or sqrt(3)/3\n\nSame thing for the secant. 270 has a reference angle of 90, so another 30,60,90 triangle. But remember, secant is 1/cos.

Each meal gets 2-3 carbs and snacks get 1-2 (you can figure carbs by looking on nutrition label taking what it has for caarbohydrates and dividing it by 15, for instance if its 32 thats roughly 2 servings of carbs).  Also for each meal you eat 3-5 oz of lean meat or 1 whole egg or 1 whole egg and 1 egg white or 3 egg whites.  You have unlitmited veggies.

Each should be 3 sets of 10 reps for first month then go to 12 reps and after that do 15 reps\nDay 4: rest\nDay 5: Cardio(choose 1): jog 15 min, jump rope 10, walk 50, swim 15, trampoline 15, sport 20, etc.\n\nthen repeat.  Note: if it is raining outside you can shuffle the days.  You should also do 15-20 pushups a night and 50-100 situps",8713

If you're still hurting after several days and the pain is getting worse you should see your health care provider.  You may have some sort of infection or damage to an organ in that area.  Or it could simply be muscle pain from a strained muscle in that area.  Your doctor or nurse practitioner could best test and determine what's going on.  I would see them though to rule out any sort of infection of one of your major organs.  It's kind of high to be appendicitis but that's possible if it's referred pain.

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788

2,"how to lose weight? ; i am 11 years old and my weight is 40 kg ; It surprises many people how much weight they can lose in just one week if they start paying attention to exactly how they live their lives. Because most of us have such fast paced, busy lives we tend to do the things that are most convenient, but often this is not what is best for our bodies. Fast food, frozen food, and very little exercise is what is usually most convenient. Luckily, there are ways to make eating healthier and to even fit in some exercise, even if you are one of the very busy!\n\nFirst, you need to look at your diet. Sometimes the things that lead to us being over weight are things that we just take for granted or don’t even really think about. Oddly enough, the biggest culprits are not what we even have to chew we simply have to swallow! Drinks! When you are thirsty and you need to grab something quick you just go to the fridge or the soda machine and crack open that can or bottle of soda. While the soda is mildly refreshing, it’s also packed with calories. If you are drinking even two or three regular sodas per day you’ll find that you are adding anywhere from 600 to 1,000 extra calories every day.

2,"Mormon Tea or Infusion? ; WOW the Mormon tea issue has caused a bit of talk!! it is called that cause what is on the label in when found at some Albertson's. i have seen it in Albertson's and other groceries labeled as ""Mormon Tea"" if you pick up various herbal and plant ID books of the southwest it is identified as ""MORMON TEA""(also called ""Young's Tea""). I asked a Mormon Priest about the herb and he knew what i was talking about exactly. check out the history of the use of the tea or infusion. why are there so many Utah herbal companies? if one were to bake into a bread or make food out of teas would a Mormon still eat it? Why do many Mormons eat so unhealthy foods full of chemicals? Why do many Mormons eat meat full of hormones. HYPOCRISY RUNS IN ALL COLOURS. if Lipton labeled their tea an ""infusion"" would they still drink it? are their any injectable drugs used in Utah hospitals made by infusion. many mormons used to come into our old bakery that certainly confused us. check facts: no hear-say. ; Wow, that's a mighty fine bunch of babbling.  Might I ask a quick question?  WHAT IN GOD'S HOLY NAME ARE YOU BLATHERING ABOUT?!?!?\n\nYou can go ahead and call it Mormon Tea, and so what if you do?  Yes, I know what it is, and no, I can't say that I've ever seen any of the hundreds of Mormons I've known ever drinking it.  So here's a quick news flash for you: in every religion, you will find disparity between what the religion asks of people and how people actually behave.  In Mormonism, it is regarded that ALL hot beverages--Mormon Tea, Earl Gray, herbal tea, you name it--are to be avoided.  The Word of Wisdom says in D&C 89:9 ""And again, hot drinks are not for the body or belly.""  Hence, coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or even Postum is something regarded as a bad idea.  Some people in the LDS church have decided to regard this as having been orginally stated because the most prominent hot drinks--coffee and tea--have caffiene, and they've decided to regard this as an indirect prohibition of caffiene-loaded drinks, while thinking things like hot apple cider or hot cocoa or Postum are okay, while Jolt, Coke, and Red Bull, though not hot, are still to be avoided; but the specific text of the LDS doctrine does not agree with that assertion.\n\nBut more importantly, what's the big deal about Mormon Tea?  Yes, it has ephedra in it, but only a teensy tiny amount of it.  There aren't any ephedra junkies lurking in ally ways trying to prostitute themselves out for a bag of Mormon Tea.  And ephedra does have some good medicinal applications, especially for people with breathing issues.  So why are you getting all bent out of shape?\n\nPS: worry less about the eating and drinking habits of Mormons and maybe focus on your grammatical skills instead.\n\nCheers.",8862

6,"CAPM in China? ; Hello,\nIm writing a paper why the CAPM doesn`t work in CHina. I need a mathematical example with the simple CAPM-equation to show it. I don`t know what I should use as the riskfree rate. So my question is whar should I use and do you know a good example or other reasons why it doesnt work? ; First of all the extension of the original CAPM(Sharpe, Mossin,\nLintner in 1963) is termed the International CAPM or ICAPM.\nTo use it in china you need a beta for the stock or for a portolio of \nstocks which will be difficult for some of the newly formed \nChinese publically traded corporations.  Another factor is the\nstock market in China is an emerging market hence it suffers from a general lack of history and liquidity though expectation is that it will grow rapidly in the future.  \n\nThe model would be:R stock = risk free rate+Beta (Rmarket-RF)\n\n  Now in the literature it is common to use either the \nU.S. Treasury Bill Rate or the U.S. Long Bond Rate. As \nRoll's critique aptly pointed out there is no truely riskless asset\nso we have used the above surrogates. Not a bad choice though since the data on them is readily available through the U.S. \nFederal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury which issues these debt \nobligations through the Fed has never defaulted on any obligations.  Further the marke is the largest most liquid debt \nmarket in the world which has investors from around the world and foreign governments buying and selling these assets \ncontinuously.   \n\nSo, next we address the matter of a market index surrogate\nto use in the right hand terms.  Since we can't really use the \nChinese swtock market Index as a true surrogate for the \nworld market index we must make one.  Assuming there is \nadequate capital market integration today to allow us to do so.\nIn the literature some have use a weighted average composite\nconsisting ofweights determined by the relative market values \nof equity traded on the diverse major wold bourses(Stock Markets).  For example the portion of equity traded in the NY\nStock market weighted by an index like the S& P 500 index\nalong with the proportion of stocks traded in London weighted \nby the FTS Index.  Gradually if you consider all the major \nmarkets today such as Tokyo, Paris, London, New York,\nCanada TSE, etc.,\nyou'll be able to compute a suitable weighted average \nRORmrkt. \n\nThe major problem you need to ovwercome in any emerging market like China is thin market trading--translation too few stocks are quoted and trading activity in them takwes too long to \nprovide investors /money managers with enough information\nderived from each successive buy-sell combination). \n\n\n  Assuming you did find an adequately traded stock with enough \nhistory in the Chinese stock market, and you did compute a \nworld market index surrogate for the market index along \nwith selecting a risk free asset such as by using the U.S. \nT Bill Yield, then you could use the equation to correctly \nprice the Chinese stock in terms of its rate of return.\n\nAssume further that you average the returns on the world market\nindexes and it turns out to be 12%.\n\nNext regress the Chinese stock past returns (having converted from Yen capital gains and dividends) againtst the historical \nworld market stock index levels for the same number of observations as you have on the Chinese stock (note: the data \nmust be aligned so that they are matched for the same time periods as those of the Chinese stock'sprice observations. \nIn other words the matched pairs must be contemperaneous with one another. You should use say weekly, monthly close \ndata and with the problem I described earlier I would use the \nlater time interval for obserfvations.  \n\nThe coefficient of this OLS simple regression is the Beta\non the stock.  Assume it is 1.5 positive.\n\n    If we assume a yield on the U.S. T Bill of 5%, the math \nthen is  Stock ROR% = 5% + 1.5(10%-5%) = 5%+7.5%= 12%\n\nThere's the heart of your paper...now gety busy and write it.\n\nTry doing a dogpile or other search for academic journal, textbooks on international finance, and other sources.",8877

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

3,"I have a brother in 4th grade who has to make a venn diagram for alternating currents, direct currents, and? ; both. And he has absoulute no clue what to do. I don't really know how to explain it to him, or even what it explain. I'm not good with electrical stuff.\n\nHow would you define a direct current and an alternating current, in the most simplest way as possible for a young child to understand? ; DC means that you have a constant voltage.  A battery is a great example of DC.  I used to like to think of electricity as water- voltage is how high up the water tank is (the higher up it is, the harder it pushes the water down), resistance is how thick the downpipe is, and current is the volume of water that flows down.  All three are connected, eg a narrower pipe gives less current \n\nAC is as if your source pushes, then pulls, then pushes, etc, the electricity.  This is what you get in your power socket.  It looks a bit like a kid jumping up and down on a trampoline... he pushes as he hits the trampoline, and pulls as he flies up.  To use our water example: imagine a pump that pushes the water, then sucks it back, then pushes...\n\nNo idea how this relates to Venn diagrams, sorry",8912

As long as you are going through a complete check up, such ultrasound will be done to see what is going on in there inside you - to assess your body parts which cannot just be assessed by any method of examinations. The doctor will look at your body system parts such as uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, kidney, bladders, ureters. \n\nI am not sure of what your real condition is but I suggest there maybe  some things the doctor wants to clarify - perhaps the doctor noted  some doubtful or suspicious clues which need to be verified by ultrasound.♥",8913

2,"how do u know when ur bipolar and what can a 14 year old girl do to get help? ; i need to know this answer bad... ; Well, first you need to look at your family history.  Has anyone in your family ever been bipolar or had bipolar tendencies?  If so, then here's the second question:  Are you ADD or ADHD?\n\nHere's my personal story:\n\nI started my period at 11.  By 13 I hit ""teenager"" years and by 14 I was into puberty.  You know, boobs, hair, voice, the works.  Except something happened.  I turned into Frankenstein's Mood monster.  I was always either really excited and upbeat, or so depressed that I would stay in my room for days and bite off anyone's head who tried to talk to me.\n\nMy family became so distraut that they finally talked about sending me to a boarding school.  the house was always tense, but I thought it was everyone else.  I was kicked out several times, moved back home, and just barely made it through my teen years without going crazy.  When I was 21, I married, and my husband saw the same thing in me - we were always fighting, and I knew it was always my fault.  I felt crazy because my moodswings were so bad.\n\nAfter lots of research and lots of crazy doctors trying to prescribe me medicines, I learned the most facinating thing:  Kids who are ADD or ADHD and go through puberty actually experience bipolar tendencies.  It's a natural, hormone-imbalance.  And since I was ADHD my whole life, it was normal.  Man I wish someone had know that back then!!!!!!\n\nHere's what you need to do:  Find out if you're ADD or ADHD.  Change your diet from sugars and white flours to lots of grains, good dark green vegetables, and unprocessed sugars and eat healthy.  Exercise and work out regularly.  Talk to your doctor about natural ways to balance out your hormones through this period.  It's possible.\n\nIt's okay, you're going to be alright.  You'll make it through this, even though now it doesn't seem like it. \n\nIf it is bipolar, you would have known at an early age, before this time.  Since you're 14 and starting to experience these symptoms, I would say most likely it's that your hormones are turning you into a woman.  Hang in there, girl!",9004

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

1,"Memetic evolution? ; Need references and opinions on whether this realy is the new DNA. ; Memes are things passed down culturally from one generation to the next such as religion.  Memetic evolution is the change of cultural customs that are passed down from generation to generation over time.  Memes are not a form of DNA at all and are just mental thoughts that are passed down verbally or otherwise over time. Memes exist, but there are no genes or DNA involved in memetic evolution.  So this is not the new DNA, but is a reference referring to the fidelity with which culture is passed on from one generation to the next.\n\nThe term meme was coined by Oxford evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his book, ""The Selfish Gene"", which I believe was first published around 1973.  Any Dawkins text would serve as a good source to study memes or memetic evolution.  Just type Dawkins or meme into any search engine and you should be able to find a good amount of information on the subject.  \nThe books that I read by Dawkins that cover the topic are: The Ancestor's Tale, The Selfish Gene, and The Devil's Chaplain.",9017

In South Africa, for example, the administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town, and the judicial capital is Bloemfontein, the outcome of the compromise that created the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn others, the ""effective"" and ""official"" capital may differ for pragmatic reasons, resulting in a situation where a city known as ""the capital"" is not, in fact, host to the seat of government:\n\n-Yamoussoukro was designated the national capital of Côte d'Ivoire in 1983, but as of 2004 most government offices and embassies were still located in Abidjan \n-Sucre is still the constitutional capital of Bolivia, but most of the national government long abandoned that region for La Paz \n-Amsterdam is the nominal national capital of the Netherlands even though the Dutch government and supreme court are both located in The Hague.\n-Kuala Lumpur is the nominal capital of Malaysia even though the Malaysian government is located in Putrajaya.\n \nIn such cases, the city housing the administrative capital is usually understood to be the ""national capital"" among outsiders.

So for you sister her ""ideal"" weight would be 140lbs.  Keep in mind that this is just a guideline.  Other factors which will affect this are genetics, bone structure and muscle mass.  Small bone structure will obviously weight less.  And since muscle weighs more than fat, a more muscular person will weigh more than the same physical size person with a higher % bodyfat.  My guess is your sister sounds like she is pretty thin, with a small bone structure and not much muscle mass.

The scientists have also verified that these circuits play a critical role in eating behaviors linked to soothing negative emotions. The study appears in the October 17, 2006 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published online in PNAS Early Edition the week of October 2.\n\nThis study opens new territory in understanding how the body and brain connect to each other, and how this connection is tied to obesity,"" said lead author Gene-Jack Wang of Brookhaven Lab's Center for Translational Neuroimaging.

I think I've gained about 25 lbs since.  Do you think it's the menopause and Temoxifen combined?  I'm 5'4 & weight about 180...I should be at 135!  Am I ever going to be that weight again? ; I do understand what you are going through.  You may not ever get back to that 135 pounds, but you can get closer to it.  The drugs make it harder, and menopause may have some effect.  But there are things you can do.\n\nIf you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose some weight. You may know that you need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need at least 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Be very conscious of your nutrition.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym.   I'd go the gym route at least to start, if you have never done weight training before.  Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.\n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss. \n\n6.

So explanations are much appreciated as they will help me to understand it a little better. Thank you so much!! ; Let B mean the genotype for dominant black fur and b mean the genotype for brown fur. \n\nRecall that when a gene is dominant, it is always expressed when  it is present. When a gene is recessive then it is ONLY expressed  when there is no alternative.\n\na) Pure black mice would have B1B2 and brown mice must be b1b2 because it is a recessive gene. (I've put in the numbers to act as subscripts so it makes more sense.) Crossing these, you would get offspring that inherit one gene from each parent.\nB1b1 ==> black\nB1b2 ==> black\nB2b1 ==> black\nB2b2 ==> black\n\nSo false because all the offspring from pure black and brown rats would be black. \n\nb) True. Pure black mice have BB. As both parents have BB then there's not a chance for bb to occur!\n\nc) False. Brown mice are always bb (recessive) so bb x bb can never result in Bb or BB. So offspring of 2 brown mice are always brown.\n\nd) Heterozygous black mice are Bb. So crossed with brown mouse bb (b1b2):\nBb1 ==> black\nbb1 ==> brown\nBb2 ==> black\nbb2 ==> brown\nSo you get equal numbers of black and brown offspring. True.",9171

1,"here is genetic problem,any medical student out there???? ; a normal healthy woman whose mother is colorblind and whose father is hemophil got married to a colorblind man,they have a colorblind son and a normal daughter.(IS IT POSSIBLE? YES OR NO? EXPLAIN!) ; Yes.  The woman is heterozygous for colorblindness (mutant from mom, normal from dad).  Since colorblindness is sex-linked recessive (i.e. carried on the x-chromosome, so males only have one copy and females have two), the son inherited the mutant allele from his mother, and non from his father.  The daughter inherited the normal allele for color vision from her mom and the mutant from her dad.  Since colorblindness is recessive, she has normal color vision.\n\nThe woman is also a carrier for hemophilia (mutant from dad, normal from mom).  The daughter would be normal no matter what unless her dad has hemophilia because she gets a normal allele from him.  She could be a carrier or could be homozygous dominant.  The son inherited the normal allele from his mom, and nothing from his dad.\n\nBy the way, contrary to the previous answer, both colorblindness and hemophilia are sex-linked _recessive_ traits.  And expression of a given allele does not ""skip a generation,"" no matter what; it is always the result of the combination of alleles, not whether the gene was expressed in the previous generation.\n\n__________\nThat's interesting, because my textbook from AP bio states, ""color-blindness is a mild disorder inherited as a sex-linked trait,"" but maybe you know something that the professors who wrote my textbook do not?  There's also the minor detail that both my AP bio teacher last year and my genetics professor this year used colorblindess as an example of a sex-linked trait.  And for what it's worth, Wikipedia states, ""the genes for the red and green color receptors are located on the X chromosome.""\n\nAutosomal traits are, by definition, not sex-influenced, as autosomal means carried on any chromosome other than the sex choromosomes.",9242
1,"Tsunami what are they? ; project ; A tsunami is a series of waves generated when a body of water, such as a lake or ocean is rapidly displaced on a massive scale. Earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and large meteorite impacts all have the potential to generate a tsunami. The effects of a tsunami can range from unnoticeable to devastating.\n\nThe term tsunami comes from the Japanese language meaning harbour (""tsu"") and wave (""nami""). Although in Japanese tsunami is used for both the singular and plural, in English tsunamis is well-established as the plural. The term was created by fishermen although they had not been aware of any wave in the open water. A tsunami is not a sub-surface event in the deep ocean; it simply has a much smaller amplitude (wave heights) offshore, and a very long wavelength (often hundreds of kilometres long), which is why they generally pass unnoticed at sea, forming only a passing ""hump"" in the ocean.\n\nTsunamis have been historically referred to as tidal waves because as they approach land they take on the characteristics of a violent onrushing tide rather than the sort of cresting waves that are formed by wind action upon the ocean (with which people are more familiar). However, since they are not actually related to tides the term is considered misleading and its",9245

1,"Math Problem!? ; What is the exact value of cos x - sin(x + 150) + cos(x + 120)?\n\nstep-by-step solution would be greatly appreciated\n\nN.B. All numbers are in degrees ; cos(a+b) = cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) \nand \nsin(a+b) = sin(a) cos(b) + sin (b) cos(a)\n\nSo first expand sin(x + 150°) into sin(x)cos(150°) +sin(150°)cos(x)\nand expand cos(x + 120°) into cos(x)cos(120°) - sin(x)sin(120°).\nnow sin (150°) is 1/2 and cos(150°) is sqrt(3)/2, sin(120°) is sqrt(3)/2 and cos(120°) is 1/2. So you have cos x - sqrt(3)/2(sin x) - 1/2cos(x) + 1/2cos x - sqrt(3)/2 sin x = cos x -sqrt(3)sin x. I assume you followed the same steps and mixed up a minus sign.

9,"What are the drawbacks to a form of capitalism built on profit sharing? ; I'm of the opinion that the distribution of wealth in this country is top heavy. 1% of the population controls approximately 90% of the wealth! A lot of this disparity comes from the fact that people work hard for low pay. The owners or stockholders get to keep most of the wealth generated from these peoples' work. What if you were to pass legislation that required businesses to not only pay salaries, but also to share profits. The business owners and stockholders would still get a share of the profits, but now the workers would too. This would certainly inspire workers to try to help the business to work better. I am considering starting a business for the sole purpose of leading by example. To me this could be a revolution of a more socialist form of capitalism.

8,"how can i deal with my fathers suicide & help y 4yr old deal as well? ; it happend sept 5 but we have a lot going on until now like a new baby started to school and now x-mas way his favorant time af year all i can do is cry ; I am so sorry for your loss.  First of all, please know that your father's act had nothing to do with you.  \nA four year old is too young to be told about suicide.  It is difficult for them to grasp the concept of death at all.  Surely there was a memorial service or a funeral.  If the child did not attend have a private one.  Look through a family album and remember some good times with your father. Tell him that granddad passed away.  Tell him that means you won't see him again, but you will always love and miss him.  Tell him you can share memories about granddad anytime he wants.  That it is alright to cry about this and feel sad, but it is also alright to be happy and granddad would want him to remember the happy days they shared. \nLet this be something you believe yourself!  Life must go on.  Get some grief counseling for yourself and/or join a survivor's support group.  \nCelebrate Christmas with your child.  You don't want the season to be a dark memory for him.  It will cheer you up to do this.  Decorate your home together.  Remember you are building memories with your child.  \nAllow yourself some private time each day to mourn, but do gather your courage to celebrate with your child.\nPerhaps buy a Christmas card for your father.  Write in it all the feelings you have about your loss.  Seal it and put it away.  \nIf you celebrate Christmas you must have a belief in God.  Pray for your healing.  Release any guilt you may be feeling to God.  Pray for your father.  \nAgain, my sympathy and my prayers go out to you.  A tribute to your father would be living the fullest life you can.",9314

She said it was her favorite holiday and she wanted to do it. I said no problem I just thought it would make things a little easier so that we wouldn't have to go to her house at 12 and my moms at 5. I have no problem doing that but my mother inlaw does. She thinks you should go to one place for the holidays I have always went to 2 familys for thanksgiving and I want to keep it that way. I like to see my family every year as well as my husbands family and I am willing to do both.\nMy mother-in-law is being really selfish she calls last night to talk to my husband and they are discusing Thanksgiving my husband tells her that we won't be eating dinner there we will have appitizers and stay a while but we are eating at my wifes mothers because we ate last year at your house for dinner. This is the problem my mom is flexible she will do lunch or dinn ; My mother-in-law told my husband and I she was not doing Thanksgiving or Christmas this year because of money, because her diabetes is getting worse and because she is tired of her son eating and running.  She does not take into account that her son works at night and has to sleep during the day.  She fixes the meal according to her schedule only.  Since she told us she wasn't cooking, we made our own pans to invite my brother over, as he has no other family in the area except us.  My husband told his mother when she asked later if we ever made other plans.  He told her and she got ill.  She went off on him because her, her husband, and her mother  weren't invited over.  He tried to explain that the seating just isn't there and she said we'd have to make our own plans.  Now she is doing nothing but laying guilt trips on him and it's working...to a point.  She will never change.  Part of it is because she is selfish and needy, though perfectly capable.  She is also jealous because he doesn't spend as much time kissing her butt.   \n\nYou are not alone.  It will either blow over or it won't.  You and your husband need to come up with a plan for the holidays.  The one you have sounds like a good one.  Either alternate holidays each year at her house and your mother's, or do Thanksgiving at your mom's/Christmas at his mom's this year.  Next year swap out.",9324

0,"Why is it some people are so quick to call others retards or insult them? ; But yet they cannot even spell grade school English words? Why do some people have a problem with others beliefs, and are so quick to come on and insult? (In a religion site if I may add.) What the fight rooms filled? MTV off the air today? Mall closed? Satanic worship hall shut down? So what we have a problem with religion, and God and Jesus, and the Jehovahs Witness' and Allah, and Wiccan, and Pagan, and Kirshna(sorry if I left out any) so we come to THERE site and INSULT them. Now that is priceless. Leave everyone to there own religion, just ask your questions, and let peace be with everyone. No matter who there God is, most here have genuine questions. ; It is true that Jehovah's Witnesses are not loved by everyone.\nhttp://jw-media.org/newsroom/human_rights.htm\nSome people hate Jehovah's Witnesses out of ignorance, or over some misunderstanding. A few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a Jehovah's Witness, and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire Christian religion.\n\nHowever, it seems that the majority of anti-Witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry. A few may even be motivated against their Christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things', Satan the Devil.\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:4) the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\n\nInterestingly, such ""hatred"" should be expected by true Christians in this time of the end, and it actually helps identify Jehovah's Witnesses as Christ's true disciples:\n\n(John 15:19) If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look! I am with you all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.\n\nLearn more:\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/jt/\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20030301/article_01.htm\nhttp://watchtower.org/e/20020401/article_01.htm",9396

All these terms with reference to the US. ; Executive search is the business of hiring professionals through a firm specializing in the process of identifying, screening and hiring for their client companies.  The term 'executive' is a bit of a euphemism, as many of the people placed through these firms aren't executives in the classic sense, but simply working at a professional level above that of administrative or clinical.  It would probably be much more informative if you simply Googled the phrase ""What is Executive Search"" and read some in-depth descriptions of the business.  Pay close attention to the differences between retained executive search and contingency executive search.\n\nHospitality Executive Searches and Healthcare Executive Searches are just that:  Searches for higher level talent within these two respective fields.\n\nIn case you're thinking of mass-mailing a resume to executive search firms hoping they'll save you the effort of conducting a proper job search--don't bother.  It's generally a complete waste of time unless you have a darn good background and already have significant experience within the field in which you're looking to advance.  I'm an executive recruiter professionally and have been so for the last 15 years.  I get countless unsolicited resumes and rarely spend more than 10 seconds with a resume.  The people I place are people whom I actively seek out, not people who are attempting to conduct a job search by passively spamming half the hemisphere with copies of a resume and waiting for their phone to ring.

WHen the ball bounces back up it gains potential energy and kinetic energy.  In a perfect system with no friction, Pe + Ke at any given time would remain a constant number.  In reality, a little energy is lost due to friction.",9428

From the top of the cliff to the bottom of the swing, he descends by 3.2 m. The vine will break if the force on it exceeds 950 N. (a) Does the vine break? (b) If no, what is the greatest force on it during the swing? If yes, at what angle with the vertical does it break? Explain your answers, and show the equations used. Good Luck!!! ; When Tarzan jumps of the cliff his speed will increase, until he reaches the bottom of the swing, after which it will decrease. His speed leads to a centripetal force which adds to his weight. \nThe speed and therefore the extra force will be maximum at the bottom of the swing, when both are pointing in the same direction.\n\nFirst we calculate the speed at the bottom of the swing. We put \nm g h = (1/2) m v^2  and find v = sqrt ( 2 g h) = sqrt (2x9.813x3.2) = 7.92 m/s.\nThis speed adds a centripetal force of m v^2 /r to Tarzan's weight.\nF_centri = (688/9.813) 62.8 / 18 = 244 N.\nAdding  this to 688 N leads to 932 N. at the bottom of the swing.\nSo the vine doesn't brake. Tarzan's high speed brain did the calculation before he jumped of course.",9548

The best you can hope for is to get the abdominal muscles that you already have to tense more.  This requires crunches but sit ups will work if you don't have access to a machine.\n\nYou could try taking creatine ester.  It causes your existing muscles to swell a little bit.  It might make you look a little better in the two weeks.  You get it at the health food store.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you want to tone and increase your build, you need to join a gym because its really difficult to do it without machines.  Not only that, but you can make friends with people there who *obviously* know what they are doing.  As long as they are not a$$holes, they usually don't mind giving other guys advice.\n\nAnother thing.  Do NOT do aerobic exercise like walking or jogging.  That's for fat people.  You said you are skinny.  You need crunches for your abs and bench presses for your pecks and triceps. Curls are also good for your biceps.  \n\nAlso, you need a high protein diet.

It is, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri demonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. It is easy to recognize the contemporary economic, cultural, and legal transformations taking place across the globe but difficult to understand them. Hardt and Negri contend that they should be seen in line with our historical understanding of Empire as a universal order that accepts no boundaries or limits. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers. \n\nEmpire identifies a radical shift in concepts that form the philosophical basis of modern politics, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, and people. Hardt and Negri link this philosophical transformation to cultural and economic changes in postmodern society--to new forms of racism, new conceptions of identity and difference, new networks of communication and control, and new paths of migration. They also show how the power of transnational corporations and the increasing predominance of postindustrial forms of labor and production help to define the new imperial global order. \n\nMore than analysis, Empire is also an unabashedly utopian work of political philosophy, a new Communist Manifesto. Looking beyond the regimes of exploitation and control that characterize today's world order, it seeks an alternative political paradigm--the basis for a truly democratic global society. \n\ncc",9588

For me, I realized I needed to eat more carbohydrates. Be careful if people tell you to eat a lot of protein. Everything must be done in moderation.

0,"How many cans of beer can a male or a female drink in order to lost his or her conciousness? ; I need to know ; The answer to this question is entirely dependant upon the persons metabolism and body weight. The amount of alcohol it takes to lose consciousness won't be the same for a 98lb person as it is for a 250lb person.\n\nAlcohol is metabolized by the liver, where enzymes break down the alcohol. Understanding the rate of metabolism is critical to understanding the effects of alcohol. In general, the liver can process one ounce of liquor (or one standard drink) in one hour. If you consume more than this, your system becomes saturated, and the additional alcohol will accumulate in the blood and body tissues until it can be metabolized. This is why pounding shots or playing drinking games can result in high blood alcohol concentrations that last for several hours.\n\nThe Blood Alcohol Educator is an interactive way to look at BAC levels. Once you input your gender and weight, you can choose the time of drink and how quickly you drink it. You can compare yourself to friends of different weights and gender:\n\nhttp://www.baecdrom.org/\n\nNow that you know how to calculate BAC, see how alcohol affects your body at different levels.

Although Grumman and McDonnell had not been awarded any Air Force contracts, they nevertheless continued to fund their own studies on the same requirements. \n\n( )...However, none of the submitted designs were considered any further by the Air Force, mainly because the aerodynamic configurations and the bypass ration of the turbofans were considered inadequate.

Your equation says that for every 4 iron atoms that react with 3 diatomic oxygen molecules, you'll produce 2 iron (III) oxide molecules.  Molecules are great and all, but that doesn't help you when you're trying to figure things out in terms of grams.  That's where Avogadro's number and the concept of the mole come into play.\n\nOn the periodic table, you'll notice that there are two numbers for each element:  the atomic number, which is the number of protons in an atom of the element; and the atomic weight (or mass), which is the total weight, in grams, of one mole (6.022 X 10^23 atoms) of that element.  (The atomic weight is also roughly equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in the most common isotope of the element.)\n\nIn order to figure out how much product you'll produce, you need to figure out how many moles of Fe you have, then work out the proportions.  Start by figuring the molar mass of each molecule in the reaction:\nFe = 55.845\nO2 = 2(15.9994) = 31.9988\nFe2O3 = 2(55.945) + 3(15.9994) = 159.8882\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe you have:\n4086 g/55.845 g/mol = 73.167 mol\n73.167 mol/4 mol Fe\n\nNow figure out how many moles of Fe2O3 you produce:\n(73.167/4) X 2 = 36.584 mol Fe2O3\n\nMultiply this by the molar mass of Fe2O3 to get the mass of the product:\n36.584(159.8882) = 5849.350 g Fe2O3\n\nb) Do the same thing you did in a), just substitute O2 for Fe2O3:\n(73.167/4) X 3 = 54.875 mol O2\n54.875 x 31.9988 = 1755.942 g O2",9687

5,"What is the longest home run ball ever hit?? ; Go Tigers!!! ; Their really isn't one correct answer to this question, I'll try to explain. I’ll start with the home run that Mickey Mantle hit at Griffith Stadium in Washington on April 17, 1953. The entire baseball world was led to believe the ball had traveled 565 feet from home plate to the point where it landed.\nIn truth, that figure derived from the distance from home plate to the place where a neighborhood child retrieved the ball. However, the actual distance in the air was probably about 510 feet (most sources still have this as #1). The same process happened again with Mantle on September 10, 1960 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit when a ball he hit was reported to have traveled 643 feet but it is readily apparent once again that the ball had bounced several times before it reached the estimated distance (this is the home run that the ""Guinness Book of Records"" has as #1). When your talking about tape measure home runs you can’t leave out Babe Ruth. It was said that Ruth once hit one 587 feet in an exhibition game against the Giants back in 1919. Also his tremendous blow to right-center field in Detroit on June 8, 1926, has often been reported as traveling 628 feet, but again was it measured where it first landed or where it came to a rest. Included among the other great exaggerations in the history of tape measure home runs are Dave Nicholson’s Comiskey Park rooftopper on May 6, 1964 who’s shot was calculated at 573 feet. The calculations were on the assumption that the ball traveled completely over the left-center-field roof. However, subsequent\ninvestigation indicated that the ball landed on the back of the roof before bouncing out into the night. Also, when Dave Kingman launched his wind-aided blow in Chicago’s Wrigley Field on April 14, 1976, ""The New York Times"" somehow concluded that it had flown 630 feet. It has been confirmed that the ball struck against the third house beyond Waveland Avenue, which is situated about 530 feet from home plate. Yet another claim (by the ""Guinness Book of Records""), has a minor league player by the name of Roy Edward ""Dizzy"" Carlyle having hit one 618 feet at Emeryville Ball Park, CA on July 4, 1929. Mark McGwire hit several home runs over 500 feet and one over 540 and his is measured accurately every time he hits one. I know I didn’t cover everything but I hope I covered enough to satisfy you.\n\nAlso, Mantle's home run off the facade at Yankee Stadium on May 22, 1963 traveled between 370 to 374 feet and was between 115 to 117 feet high. If it was still going up like some people claim it would have traveled an estimated distance of 620 feet if left unimpeded. However, the reality is that the ball was already on its way down, and those reporting the trajectory were victimized by a common optical illusion. It is a scientific fact that if Mantle, or anyone else, had sufficient strength to hit a ball that was still traveling upward when it met the towering facade, he would also have enough strength to clear that same facade by a distance of at least 100 feet. In order for the ball to be rising at roof level, it would have to have been traveling at a lower angle than that which produces maximum distance. If Mantle had provided the same power or velocity, but had launched the ball at a higher and more efficient angle, it would have passed out of Yankee Stadium at a height of over 200 feet! Mantle hit the facade on two or perhaps three occasions, but never cleared it.\nSource(s):\nYou can also go to:\n\nhttp://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/ar...",9694

9,"Do you believe in gay marriage/rights? ; Even if your religion says its wrong, can u impose it on other people? Separation of Church and State right? ; It's so interesting to hear such silly statements.\n\nFirst off, I'm gay, so I think I know more about being gay than anyone here.  No, it's not a choice, and yes it is natural.  If by natural, you mean occurring in nature then chimps, most all primates, and even some birds (Emperor Penguins)have shown homosexuality. \n\nSecondly, yes children are cruel.  So wouldn't it make more sense to stop teaching children racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of cruelty, rather than try to change gay people?  I'm quite sure I didn't choose to be persecuted.  There are already tens of thousands of children in schools right now who belong to gay parents.\n\nThirdly, I'm so sick of people talking about one verse in the Bible as justification for taking away my rights.  Yes Leviticus says homosexuality is wrong.  It also says specifically that it is an abomination, (in Hebrew it's the same word) to eat pork, shrimp, and wear clothes of mixed fabrics.  Do you worship the Sabbath on Saturday or Sunday?  Leviticus stipulates Saturday, and that anyone who works on Saturday should be sentenced to death.  Why are we quick to follow the law (singular) about homosexuality, when we never seem to pay attention to any of these other laws?\n\nWe need gay marriage because every day gay people are denied their civil rights.  When my partner got into a motorcycle accident the hospital attendant wouldn't let me in because ""Only family relations are allowed to enter.""  I have to pay extra taxes every pay period because I cover is health care; straight married couples don't have to pay these taxes because the health care coverage is not considered income.\n\nI also don't want to hear any nonsense about civil unions.  Marriage is a civil right; it should be granted to all Americans.  Setting up civil unions and domestic partnerships only creates a group of second class citizens.  We tried separate but equal for 60 years in the south.  It doesn't work.  One group is always treated as second class citizens, while the other group is ""normal.""",9741

""The magnitude of changes that are entailed in this bill -- and are largely unknown -- rival the impact of the creation of Social Security or the creation of the Medicare program,"" said Robert Rector, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation who conducted the study. Although the legislation would permit 193 million new immigrants in the next two decades, Mr. Rector estimated that it is more likely that about 103 million new immigrants actually would arrive in the next 20 years. ; Latinos will be the majority in the US in 20-25 years!\n\nWhat then?  This country will have a VERY different face, tone, direction.  National security an issue?  I think so...\nNational interests re-aligned?  I think so...  Everything will be in Spanish, then English, the dollar will be incredibly LOW (look at Mexico today - look at ANY hispanic country today)...  Civil war???  Maybe...  \n\nLook at what happened to countries in Europe.  Most recently - Yugoslavia.  Quick history lesson for those that don't know, might bring a wierd, yet possible new perspective to this thing.  One that could happen.  Got me thinking anyway.  I would hate for something like this to happen:  I was in Kosovo during that whole war (and stuff leading up to it).  The whole deal was over ethnic Albanians that came to live and settle, then over-populate the southern area of Serbia (Yugoslavia).  Within 30-40 years, they completely re-populated the region (10 to 1 ratio of Albanians to Serbs), took jobs, changed the language, changed the religion, lowered living standards (dirty streets, neighborhoods, more crime).  Pissed off the Serbs something fierce!  Granted, what they did under SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC (that sick bastard) was disgusting, by deciding to ""ethnically cleanse"" the area - BUT it just goes to show how a MADMAN could rile up what the local people who were frustrated TRULY felt about being having their country essentially ""taken over.""  MILOSEVIC just played on their frustrations and nationalism to the Nth degree.  Then took the still somewhat communist style army and started whacking away at the Albanians in Kosovo.  It was pretty grim.  I'd hate to see our country ever delve into such dire territory.  YET IT IS NOT COMLETELY UNIMAGINABLE.  HOW MANY CONVERSATIONS HAVE YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW HAD ABOUT WANTING THEM ALL TO JUST GO BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM, ya know?\n\nBad stuff.  Anyways, I'm not saying some ignorant crap like they should all go back to where they came from - casue we're all essentially related to immigrants.  Yet we have to examine what we can handle in this country.  Our principles that our forefathers read as they came to the US fresh off the boats from Europe of ""Give us your poor, etc.."" should be held near and dear to us as principles, but REALITY needs to kkep us in check.  How much more can we afford right now?  ESPECIALLY when old G.W. is spending BAZILLIONS on the war!  We're sorta bankrupt right now.  We need to close the doors, lock 'em, fix up our own house, ask our friends that want to visit (prospective immigrants) to wait a little longer while we clean our house up for guests, then maybe let some more in.  We should let them in on an equal basis, too.  Right now we have WAY TOO FREAKIN MANY MEXICANS (and CENTRAL AMERCIANS are quickly climbing the ranks)  Where are the CANADIANS?  Seriously?  Hispanics are now the largest minority group in the country (and ballooned to that number in record time).  We need to balance the books as far as immigrants go.  How about from the EUROPEAN continent - any takers?  ASIA?  AUSTRALIA?  ANTARCTICA (I heard it's pretty cold there)?  SOUTH AMERICA?  Once we even out our supposed ""melting pot"", then we can re-examine letting in some more MEXICANS.  \n\nWE NEED A GREAT WALL, NOW!!!  Vicente Fox (Mexican President) said he will SUE the US if we start to violate the rights of his people who are illegally crossing the border (that he knows about and is obviously complicit in).  This was spuured by Bush's recent decision to put National Gaurd troops at the US border as a stop-gap measure (hopefully just temporary until we get a ton of new border agents).  Dude will SUE us???  Gimme a break!  ASS!  Then he said he might start sending his troops to the border to make sure we are not hurting his people.  Why not just SEND YOUR FREAKIN TROOPS THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE OR WORK WITH US SO WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ",9785

1,"two physics questions, if you could help me step by step that'd be great since my teacher doesn't teach. ; 1) A clerk moves a box of cans down an aisle by pulling on a rope attached to the box. The clerk pulls with a force of 188 N at an angle of 25.0° with the horizontal. The box has a mass of 36.9 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between box and floor is 0.450. Find the acceleration of the box.\n\n2)A box of books weighing 259 N is shoved across the floor by a force of 435 N exerted downward at an angle of 35° below the horizontal. \n\n(a) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.57, how long does it take to move the box 9 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n(b) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.75, how long does it take to move the box 7 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n--what do the symbols even mean.... so yeah im really lost if u guys could explain how to do these probs so i know in the future, i'd appreciate it a lot. thanks ; 1) The angle of the rope needs to be considered to calculate horizontal and vertical components of the clerk's force. \nFh = 188*cos(25) = 170 N This is what pulls the box.\nFv = 188*sin(25) = 79.5 N This actually lifts the box slightly.\n\nThe symbol for coefficient of kinetic friction is µk. A lower number makes it easier to move the box - if you spilled some olive oil on the floor µk would perhaps go to 0.1. N is normal force. If this was on a slope, normal would be different from weight, but the floor here is level so N = W? \n\nActually no. Because the rope pulls up on the box slightly, the normal force pressing the box to the floor is less than the box's full weight. The box's weight = m*g = 36.9 kg*9.8 m/s^2 = 362 N. The vertical component of the tension in the rope relieves 79.5 N of that so N = 362 - 79.5 N = 282 N. \n\nSo Ff = .450*282 N = 127 N is the force that friction fights with. The horizontal portion of the clerk's pull is 170 N. So there is 43 N left over to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law says\nF = m*a\n43 N = 36.9 kg*a\nso a = 1.17 m/s^2\n\n2) Here the force is directed down at an angle so the vertical component of the force will add to the normal force used in calculating the friction.\nFh = 435 N*cos(35) = 356 N\nFv = 435 N*sin(35) = 250 N\n\nN = the weight of the box + Fv = 259 N + 250 N = 509 N\n\na) Ff = µk*N = .57* 509 N = 290 N This is not enough to hold the box stationary so 356 - 290 N = 66 N are available to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law again:\nBut first we need the box's mass. W = m*g\nm = W/g = 259/9.8 N = 26.4 kg. Now\nF = m*a\n66 N = 26.4 kg*a\na = 66/26.4 m/s^2 = 2.5 m/s^2\n\nThis is getting complicated. To move 9 m will take t seconds:\nx = (1/2)*a*t^2 Solve for t.\n\nb) Ff = µk*N = .75* 509 N = 381 N This is more than the horizontal portion of the clerk's push, so the box will resist. The answer is 0.",9800

Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and visited them on Earth often. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came to Earth in an attempt catch Zeus with the nymphs.\n\nEcho wanted to save her nymph friends, so she talked to Hera incessantly in order to distract her and allow time for Zeus and the nymphs to leave. However, Hera eventually interrupted Echo and went into the field where Zeus and the nymphs had been. When she saw the field was empty, Hera realized what Echo had done and punished her.\n\nOvid's version of events states that Zeus employed Echo to occupy Hera whilst he continued with his adulteries. Hera soon saw through this ruse and punished her so that she could say only the last words of other people's sentences (echolalia). She could not speak of her own accord and so was deprived of the thing she loved the most.\n\nIn the time of Echo's suffering, there was a human named Narcissus. He was so handsome that every girl or boy that saw him immediately fell in love with him. But Narcissus had no heart, and loved no one.\n\nOne day, Echo met Narcissus and, like every other girl and boy, fell in love with him. Echo could not speak to him, but she had felt she needed to see him. So Echo followed him, just enough to see him, but not enough to be seen.\n\nNarcissus became lost and called out, ""Is anyone here?""\n\nEcho said, ""Here, here, here.""\n\nNarcissus told whoever was there to come out. Echo came out and, because she couldn't talk, used her hands to show Narcissus how much she loved him. Narcissus, annoyed that so many people liked him, rejected her love. Echo, heart-broken, prayed to Aphrodite for death. Her prayer was answered, but Aphrodite loved her voice, so she let her voice live on.",9804

The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4.  Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business",9819

0,"Has anyone had an experience with ghosts. I use to believe in them but I am not sure now.? ; There certainly have been a lot of sightings in the worlds. Any stories anyone? (real ones) ; I believe in ghostly events.  Having witnessed 5 events personally and watched my daughter holding a conversation with my mother after my mother had died.  As I have told of one of my experiences in a Wiltshire pub previously I will not re-tell that one, however I  will share these 2 with you.\n\nSome years ago, whilst working as a Security Supervisor at a Retail Outlet my colleague started out on his patrol.  As he wandered sown the mall he shouted back to me, ""look at the clock"".  The clock he was referring to was an old railway platform clock that had been restored and worked fine.  The hands on the clock were spinning furiously in different directions, they continued to do so for about 10 minutes then they stopped at the correct time and kept time for the remainder of the shift. (The whole thing was recorded on CCTV as we knew no-one would believe us).\n\nAt the same venue, I observed a man wearing a burgundy waistcoat walk into a children's playing area and towards some glass doors linking two of the malls. These doors were locked, the fire exits to the left of the doors were secured by plastic seals  and the only way back out would have been to return the same way as he had entered. Back through the children's playing area and along the concourse. Once again all the CCTV cameras in that area (there was 3) were pointing at this man who would be about 50-55 years old, quite a portly figure wearing a burgundy waistcoat and white shirt (please bear in mind that it was in the early hours of the morning and quite cold).  When my colleague went to investigate the man was no where to be seen. He checked the fire exits and all seals were intact, all the mall doors were locked. The only way that he could have gone was back through the playing area.  After the shift we pulled the CCTV tapes and you could follow this man's steps all the way up to the mall doors, where he goes out of sight behind a brick pillar, then moments later my colleague arrives at the location to find no-one there.\n\n(The outlet is a regenerated Railway building - could it have been an old station master?)\n\nThere will always be some people who do not believe - but I have seen too much to believe there is nothing after this life for us.",9844

1,"Is there dwarfism in turtles? ; Okay here's why I asked this: I've been enjoying catching and releasing turtles since I was a little girl. My friends, family and I started a tradition wear we'd paint their plastrons with unique symbols made from nail polish, so we'd recognize them if we'd catch 'em again. Some markings last longer than others. Besides natural wear, I figured that some lasted longer than others because if the turtle was still growing bigger, it's shell would get bigger and stretch the nail polish making it crack off. This one Blanding's turtle we've been catching for over the past five years and his markings are still there! He's obviously done growing. But there's this one little painted turtle I caught this year that's no bigger than it was last year, and the marking looked as new as it did last year. But the turtle looked pretty little and looked like it should have grown some. Maybe it's a ""midget"" turtle? ; cool question!\n\nno reptiles do not suffer from dwarfism in the true sense that humans do \n\nbut they can have retarded or stunted growth due to stress or poor food etc either when they are in the egg or subsequent to that",9852

Why doesnt the lim f(0+h)-f(0)/h not exist.  Does f have either a left hand or right hand derivative?? ; First, since 1/x is not defined for x = 0, before you can show  anything about your functions, you have to define values for g(0) and f(0). I'm going to assume that either the original statement of the problem had that or that you are supposed to find the value that makes the problem solvable.\n\nTo be true you have to define the problems with f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0\n\n\nFor the continutiy of f(x) given epsilon > 0 find delta > 0 such that |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon for all |x-0| < delta.\n\n|f(x) - f(0)| = |xsin(1/x) - 0| < |x| = |x - 0|\n\nGiven epsilon, pick delta = epsilon.\nIf |x-0| < delta, then |f(x) - f(0)| < epsilon.\n\n\nAs for the differentiability of g(x),\n\nf(0+h) - f(0)) = (0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0\n\nlim(x->0)(f(0+h) - f(0))/h = \nlim(x->0)((0+h)^2sin(1/(0+h)) - 0)/h = \nlim(x->0) h^2(sin(1/h)/h = lim hsin(1/h) = 0\n\nSo the limit exists and is 0.",9853

Whales (mostly sperm whales) were hunted for their oil which could be used for light, make up, and other things. Once petrolium (crude oil) was discovered, whaling was no longer necessary.

9,"what is ""TRAJECTORY"" stands for ? ; It is related to armour or military tech,weapon & sniper ; It is the path of a projectile in space. It can be powered or not powered. Even when we through, the path taken by the stone is called the Trajectory.The stone initially raises due to the thrust imparted by the thrower and after reaching they top most point( called apogee), It starts falling due to the pull of gravity. The trajectory depends upon the acceleration of the projectile. Rockets are designed 3 or 4 stages depending upon the mission ( low earth orbit, Polar Orbit or Geo synchronous orbit) and the pay load weight. After burning for the pre calculated period,The spent stage falls down and its trajectory is calculated through a rigorous mathematical analysis in the computer to ascertain that it falls in to the safe place.This is called aero dynamic analysis which takes in to account the acceleration, drag of the atmosphere and the disturbance due to separation and shock when it crosses the sound barrier and many more factors like constant pull of the gravity. We do not call the motion of objects on land or water as trajectory. however the missiles fired by bub marines inside the water has to face similar environmental obstacles. So it also falls in to the category of trajectory.",9872

I've gone through half a marking period in 10th grade at public school, but I want to switch to homeschooling. I live in New Jersey. My parents cannot personally teach me.\n\nIs there any webschool I can participate in, or any program in which I can teach myself and have tests administered by my parents to me? I need an option that doesn't require heavy parental activity, but can be done from home.\n\nThanks. ; Check out Keystone National High School at http://keystonehighschool.com.  My 16 year old son is homeschooled and takes courses through Keystone.  You can start courses any time and you have between 8 weeks (minimum) and a year (maximum, but you can apply for an extension) to complete them.\n\nFor $279-$379 (depending on if you do correspondence or online) per full-year course they provide you with the textbook, a study guide, and examinations.  You do six assignments per course (covering around 2-6 chapters each, depending on the length of the text), a mid-term, and a final exam.  All of the assignments and exams are open book.  This doesn't mean that they are easy or that it is a ""cheater"" method--they really make you work hard to earn good grades!\n\nThe courses can be completed with as much or as little parental involvement as desired.  You are able to contact your teachers so you don't need to have your parents teach you.  And because the exams are open book, they don't even have to administer the tests.  My son does most of the work on his own.  If he needs assistance he asks me or his girlfriend (he is behind 2 years in school because he was adopted from Russia where they start 1st grade at age 8, so she is 2 years ahead of him).  Because he is an English-as-a-second-language student, I review all of his essays before he sends them in to help out with grammar and spelling, but if your English skills are good, you don't need to have your parents do this.\n\nThe most important thing is that Keystone is ACCREDITED!  You get a REAL diploma from them, not a GED!  Future employers and colleges consider diplomas much better than GEDs and they are also more likely to consider a real diploma better than you just saying that you were homeschooled.\n\nAnother important thing is that you can just complete 10th grade if you want and then go back to regular school next year.  Most schools will accept Keystone's credits just like they would accept credits from any other transferring school.\n\nThe only commitment you need to make to Keystone at any given time is a single course--or you can officially enroll and take 5 courses, which is considered a full load.  My son takes 4 courses at a time, I know another student who takes them one at a time--spending all of her time on a single course over 8 weeks and then doing the next one during the next 8 weeks.\n\nGood luck!",9885

Interesting question.\n\nYes - Google Earth will get you Free Satellite Images, but not live. Other companies provide near-live satellite images, but not free.

Furthermore, there's no such thing as a geo-synchronos imagery satellite - If there were, the CIA would have use of it.

9,"Would this new theory about abortion work? ; I don't think this would ever happen, but I just want to hear good responses to an age old, untouchable, taboo subject.  \n\nHere's my theory:\n\nWhy is it that murderers, rapists, and child molesters still have the ability to retain their rights under the Constitution?  Even after being reconvicted of more crimes?  And conversely why do we feel that its o.k. to kill unborn lives that have not done anything and may be the unintended consequences of rapes?  The mothers do not have to keep them if that is the issue.  And I'm definitely not suggesting making it illegal to abort fetuses that would grow up with such mental or physical difficulties that it would be cruel and impossible for them to live past a few moments from birth.  (babies born without brains or other horrible things like that).  \nBut wouldn't it be interesting if we stopped protecting the worst in our society, and used all that money to support the innocent? ; I thought for a moment you were putting something new forward here, but this is the same old tired rhetoric of the fundamentalists.\n\nSince 1976, 43,000,000 terminations have been carried out. If they'd all gone to term, who would have raised these children? Not the mothers, because they didn't want them. And not adoptive parents - right now in this country there are only 1.8 million adopted children. So these children would have been housed and raised by the state.\n\nPlease don't tell me there are thousands of caring families waiting to adopt - it isn't true. Our care homes are stuffed full of American children that cannot be placed with a family, because everyone wants a cute little baby - not a three year old with developmental problems caused by their mother's drug abuse. Americans would rather adopt a baby from 14,000 miles away than take care of an American child. \n\nSo if your dream came true and terminations were made illegal, aside from the many deaths resulting from attempted back-street terminations, just what would you do with all those children?",9905

If she's your EX and YOU want to keep it that way--for whatever reason, then continue ignoring her and eventually she'll get the clue.  I think she's trying to either get you mad by talking to your friends, or get your attention just to keep you hooked.

2,"What is Parkinson's Disese? ; What are some of the physical restrictions that develope? ; (m)\n\nParkinson's disease (paralysis agitans or PD) is a movement disorder often characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia), and in extreme cases, a loss of physical movement (akinesia). The primary symptoms are due to excessive muscle contraction, normally caused by the insufficient formation and action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Parkinson's disease was first formally recognised and its symptoms documented in 1817 in An Essay on the Shaking Palsy by the British physician Dr James Parkinson; the associated biochemical changes in the brain of patients were identified in the 1960s.\n\nParkinson disease affects movement (motor symptoms). Typical other symptoms include disorders of mood, behavior, thinking, and sensation (non-motor symptoms). Individual patients' symptoms may be quite dissimilar; progression is also distinctly individual. There are four major dopamine pathways in the brain; the nigrostriatal pathway, referred to above, mediates movement and is the most conspicuously affected in early Parkinson's disease. The other pathways are the mesocortical, the mesolimbic, and the tuberoinfundibular. These pathways are associated with, respectively: volition and emotional responsiveness; desire, initiative, and reward; and sensory processes and maternal behavior. Reduction in dopamine along the non-striatal pathways is the likely explanation for much of the neuropsychiatric pathology associated with Parkinson's disease.",9909

When you are looking at an item, look to see who it is available from. It can say one or both of the following: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and/or available from these sellers. In my experience as an employee, I have seen items ship all over the world. If it says ships from and sold by Amazon then it should ship anywhere in the world. If you select an item from a different seller, there is a chance that they will not ship overseas. The great thing about Amazon is that they will post a link to sellers of an item even if they sell it cheaper than Amazon does. That way, you have a choice as to where to go to purchase an item.\n\nOf course, if you are still unsure about shipping to your country, you can always email customer service. The website also lists links to several of their international sites.\n\nThe first link I've listed should take you to a a portion of Amazon's site that lists deadlines for international orders.
