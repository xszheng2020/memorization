5,"Any results on ufc spike tv? ; Want to bet my friends ?Be nice to know where to put my $$$ on the winner ; Lutter totally imposed his gameplan on Patrick Cote, took him down as Cote attempted a to stand back up Lutter caught him in an armbar. \n\nMatt Sera won a decision over Chris Lytle, I think Lytle fought well but matt was constantly the agressor dispite the fact the Lytle (the striker) constantly stuffed his jui-jitsu attempts that would have smothered a lesser opponent, it was a decision surrounded by contraversy as serra was booed constantly during the trophy presentation and even had the balls to call the current Welterweight Champion Matt Hughes a ""Fu.cking D.ckhead"". \n\nJorge Rivera mounted an excellent standup offense forcing Edwin ""Bam Bam"" Deewees into the cage taking punishment and although he took very little if any actual damage he made no attempt to be offensive or even better his position forcing the referee to end the fight\n\nThales Leites faced Martin Kampmann. Heavily hyped fighters can have a huge impact on the sport (Anderson Silva), while others are just that... hype (Sean Gannon). Thales Leites had quite a bit of hype coming into his bout with Martin Kampmann, but the Brazilian was unable to live up to the fans' anticipation after gassing out late in the first round and getting knocked around for the remainder of the fight. Kampmann looked very good with his stand-up, and to Leites credit, he withstood a world of punishment in the second and third rounds without being finished. At the end of the day, Martin Kampmann is the fighter walking out still undefeated in the UFC, while Leites heads back to Brazil to figure out what went wrong.\n \nIn what was one of the most exciting fights in recent UFC history, Scott “Hands of Steel” Smith squared off with his good friend from the show, Pete “Drago” Sell. This fight was taped as a preliminary bout earlier in the night and aired during the Spike TV broadcast. \n\nOn paper, it seemed like Sell would want to take the fight to the ground, where he would have the advantage over Smith, but it was much the opposite as these two threw everything, including the kitchen sink, at each other while standing up. They both smiled continuously as they pounded on one another and at the end of the first round, they hugged and almost looked like they were going to the same corner after the round. The second round saw much of the same but with a couple of minutes remaining, Pete Sell landed a very big shot to Scott Smith’s ribs, causing him to buckle and stumble towards the corner. Just as Smith fell to one knee and “Drago” moved in for the kill, the former WEC Light Heavyweight Champion mustered just enough strength to throw one more punch, and in dramatic fashion he absolutely floored Sell with the shot. Just barely having the strength to jump up and finish the fight, Smith instantly crumbled afterwards, holding his stomach in obvious pain. There’s not much of a chance that the UFC won't bring back both of these fighters after what has to be considered fight of the night.\n\nAlso, Rich “No Love” Clementi and Din Thomas put on an action packed fight, as the 155-pound fighters usually seem to do. The fight remained standing for a big part of the first round with Clementi throwing heavy shots but Thomas was the definitively better striker, landing the crisper punches throughout. \n\nIn the 2nd round, the action was moving at a feverish pace and Thomas was able to truly display how much his stand-up game has advanced when he picked Clementi apart. After a few heavy shots, Thomas moved to take Clementi’s back, where he secured a rear naked choke, forcing the submission and getting the win. Din Thomas is just another very dangerous opponent in an already stacked UFC lightweight division, but he made no bones about who he wants next when he called out UFC Lightweight Champion Sean Sherk, saying that Sherk had his title.",13
9,"Did you really get a tax cut under Bu$h? ; Some do not understand even simple math. I pay $2200 per year in School taxes on my property, in simple math is this a Tax cut? It increased 5 times in 4 years under Bu$h.\n\nWASHINGTON - If it seems like your taxes have been going up, they probably have — at least at the state level. State taxpayer burdens increased by an average of 41 percent from 1994 to 2004, according to newly released data from the census bureau. Only one state, Alaska, saw the amount it collects per person decline. Even when the numbers are adjusted for inflation, the individual tax burdens increase in 43 states.\nHawaiians last year paid the most to state government — $3,050 per person on average. Texans paid the least — an average of $1,368.\nRising education and Medicaid costs have fueled spending growth, which has led to higher taxes, analysts said.\n""Medicaid has been the fastest growing program in state budgets going back to 2000,"" said Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst at the National Council of State Legislatures.\nMedicaid is the state-federal health insurance program for the poor. In an effort to stem rising costs, Congress passed legislation last week allowing states to charge about 13 million Medicaid beneficiaries new or increased co-payments and premiums. ; Only if you are a major corporation and/or a really rich person that does not need a tax cut.  I'm too poor to get a tax cut. Billioaires for Bush",16

0,"How does a wiccan choose their pantheon? ; I need help choosing a pantheon of gods and goddesses! How does someone studying to practice The Craft choose one? Is it even necessary?  My big thing is that I like some of the Roman dietes, the Greek dietes, and Egyptian dietes, but I read somewhere that one should not mix pantheons. Is this true? ; I think it's a matter of personal preference. I know many Pagans who don't choose specific deities and others who do. Personally, I worship Bast as my patron Goddess simply because, in most things, she most closely represents my personal beliefs and preferences. That doesn't mean that I haven't asked for assistance from others, or paid them tribute, at different times. I tend to think of the Green Man as my patron God just because it feels right, and I find that a lot of the time you should end up doing what feels right. I don't think it's something you should worry too much about since most Pagans believe that all of the Gods are aspects of the same, and all the Goddesses aspects of the same. For that matter, most Pagans tend to believe that they are all aspects of the same deity and we simply think of a male and female being because it's easier for us to comprehend that way. So do what's right for you. Pick a pantheon, don't pick one, mix pantheons... They'll be there for you regardless.",25
9,"my file to remove conditional green card has been denied, what are the deportation laws concerning this.? ; i am currently married to a u.s. citizen and living in u.s. with a conditional green card.  i filed papers to remove my conditions  on my green card and it have been denied.  i am currently in review for deportation.  what are my legal rights, and how will immigration laws effect my return to the u.s. in 6months. ; Look, you've been farting around for six months, now you post here.

2,"i can't sleep at night i don't drink caffine though.? ; I'm 12 and i want my sleep! i want to grow :) but i CAN'T SLEEP. i feel uncomfortable and my heart rate goes fast and i breathe hard it bothers me so much. whats wrong with me? does fast metabolism cause this? ; Your metabolism determines how much energy you expend while at rest; it does not determine how well you sleep.\n\nI'll give you some pointers on getting a better night's sleep. If these ""sleep hygiene"" tips don't work, you may wish to consult a doctor.\n\n1. Avoid caffeine. It sounds like you're already doing this, so good for you! (I'm posting this advice anyway in case others are having similar problems.) Also avoid smoking (as nicotine is a stimulant) and drinking alcohol (which interferes with natural sleep) before bedtime.\n\n2. Try to go to bed and get up the same time each day, even if you don't have to (e.g., on weekends). This will help your body establish a stable sleep schedule.\n\n3. Turn the lights down about an hour before your bedtime. Light sends signals to your brain that it should be awake, and this is not the message you want to send if you want some sleep!\n\n4. Exercise regularly! But avoid exercising a few hours before your bedtime.\n\n5. Take a warm bath or shower before bed. This will help relax you.\n\n6. Drink milk shortly before bedtime, or eat some turkey. Both of these foods contain substances that help promote sleep. Some people have reported success with taking melatonin.\n\n7. Do not use your bed to watch TV, play video games, read, or do your homework. You want your brain to associate being in bed with going to sleep, not other activities.\n\n8. If you find you cannot sleep, don't stay in bed and get anxious about how much sleep you're missing. Instead, get up, and find some relaxing activity you can do (e.g., reading) under dim light until you begin to feel drowsy again.\n\n9. Be careful about taking sleep-inducing medications, as these can be habit-forming and also interfere with the REM (dream) phase of sleep, which is the most refreshing part of sleep.\n\nGood luck!",27
7,"Why does everyone who makes a ""how much do you know about Naruto"" quiz on quizilla, think they know all about ; it?   This is a question my son wants answered:D ; This happens because there are Naruto fans that they know almost everything there is to the animation series, but in reality, the actual Japanese companies: Studio Pierrot, TV Tokyo, Aniplex, and TV Tokyo Music, who have created the series really know everything about the series.\n\nThere are lots of Naruto fans out there and some even live on the shows when they are released. When an individual makes a quiz, they just want to compare their knowledge with other people who are also fans to Naruto. \n\nThere can even be times when the person making the quiz is wrong on some facts. However, they just guess and make questions out of them. It is only their opinion of who is right or wrong. Unless a person has analyzed every aspect and every episode of the Naruto series, a person will not be able to know everything about it. \n\nThose who make the quizzes probably do know a lot about the anime series, but I doubt they know everything. The basic truths of the human mind can only go so far.\n\nQuizilla is a place that people make quizzes to test others' abilities or are bored and have enjoyment while creating their own quiz. I don't recommend the site if you want to learn more things that others have already learned. \n\nAll and all, confidence is the key idea that we should be looking at in the person making the quiz. There is no other solution.",28
2,"I need a good workout routine as I have recently gained a lot of weight.? ; I am in the second year of college and have stayed at a normal weight of 120-125 ever since I was 13. (I am 5'3.5"".) However, with finals coming up and the abundance of food, I was under a lot of stress and my appetite increased a lot. I gained 10 pounds in 2 months. I have tried cutting back on calories but I have no will power as my appetite is out of control and I am constantly hungry and eating twice as much as I used to. I tried walking on the treadmill for 20 minutes but it made me sore and gave me horrible joint pain.

9,"Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? ; Do Orwell’s Predictions Ring True? \n\n\nBy Derek Shaw \nThe Daily Trojan\nOctober 4, 2002 \nGeorge Orwell's ""1984"" depicts a world that has been reduced to absolute governmental control over all areas of life, banishing the freedom to love, read and even think freely. The threat of constant warfare falsely propagated by the ""Party,"" the single political power in the totalitarian state of Oceania, allows the government to maintain and expand its reign over the lives of its people.\n\nSound somewhat familiar? Well it should ...\n\nAs the likelihood of war in the Middle East continues to escalate, American citizens are slowly and methodically being stripped of some of their most fundamental civil liberties. Meanwhile, the U.S. government has successfully created an unprecedented fervor of patriotism, causing Americans to blindly hand over their freedoms in exchange for the promise of security. \n\nWithout attempting to cast any unmerited aspersions on our government or immaturely parallel a piece of fiction to reality, it is nonetheless interesting and rather eerie to compare the events in ""1984"" to the affairs of today.\n\nLet's look at the facts.\n\nIn ""1984,"" the bold slogan of the Party is ""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength."" This set of socio-political paradoxes serve to justify the actions of the government while forcing the population to abide by the imperishable laws. The assumed objective of protecting the nation rationalizes all violence and corruption.\n\nThe state of Oceania in ""1984"" is involved in an eternal war with an unclear, ever-shifting enemy. The government leads the public to \n\nbelieve that they are always in danger, when in fact \n\nmuch, if not all, of the war is fabricated. One day the enemy is Eurasia, and the next day the government announces that the enemy is Eastasia and has always been Eastasia. The people swallow the lies and digest them as truths without raising a single question. The real purpose of war is to control opposition of the government and maintain total authority by cultivating fear and hatred.\n\nToday we are facing imminent war with Iraq. A year ago our target was al-Qaida and bin Laden. Then it became a battle within Afghanistan. And just to be sure, President George W. Bush openly labeled Iran, North Korea and Iraq as the ""axis of evil."" In a later speech, he added Cuba, Libya and Syria to the growing list of nations that are allegedly seeking to obtain or develop weapons of mass destruction.\n\nIndeed, the war on terrorism has spread out of control. On Aug. 22, 2002, Bush called Saddam Hussein a threat to the civilized world and announced that it was in everyone's best interest to see him removed from power. Granted, Hussein is not the first person on most of our Christmas card mailing lists, but what has really happened in recent years to warrant such treatment? Surely it is a mere coincidence that Bush (former oil tycoon) is targeting Iraq, which just so happens to have one of the most plentiful petroleum supplies in the world.\n\nIn many ways, Bush has become the physical manifestation of Big Brother, the omnipotent, all-knowing symbol of leadership in Oceania. In ""1984,"" Big Brother is both feared and loved by the people. His power goes untested. Similarly, the Bush administration has sculpted an infallible image of integrity for itself, and the American people have responded with a show of faith and support. In fact, it has become accepted, if not fashionable, to show American pride with stickers, T-shirts and flags. A frenzy of nationalism has infected our country; and consequently we have put trust in the government to do all that is necessary to defend and vindicate the United States.\n\nAs a result, American freedoms are being cleverly attacked by new legislation, which is taking advantage of the vulnerability of its citizens. In ""1984,"" signs re ; With massive data bases of information piling up in government and corporate computers as well as security cameras around every corner and on every cell phone, I often get the feeling Big Brother is watching.  However, I feel Huxley's ""A Brave New World"" is better example of the direction we have been moving as a society.  Everywhere people are seeking their own ""Soma"" to cover up our social flaws.  We are also pushing closer and closer to his predictions of class and family structures .",40

1,"when zinc rod is immeersed in blue colour copper sulphate. blue colour fades away. give reasons.? ; chemistry ; all the information you need is in the handy periodic table.   First, think about the charges of the molecules....\n\n In the molecule CuSO4, copper has two electrons to give.  The SO4 molecule wants TWO more electrons to acheive noble gas configuration (a stable electron state).   This appears to be a match in heaven.  \n\nWell all is fine until Zinc comes along.  If you look at the periodic table, Zinc is just to the right of copper.  It too has 2 electrons to donate......but, it is more electronegative than copper. (remember, electronegativity  is the lowest in the bottom left corner of the table(Fr) and increases on  a diagonal path  with F being the most electronegarive.)  \n\nSince Zinc is more reactive than Copper,  a replacement reaction occurs.  Zinc bumps Copper off of the SO4 molucule.  Zinc can be whitiish to yellowish in solution.  As all the Zinc is coming off the rod, it bumps the copper off the SO4 and also disperses the colour of the copper.  If you had one drop of blue dye (the copper), but added a cup of milk. ( the Zinc)...... you would barely see the blue color.",43

If I'm not mistaken, it was a Best Picture winner, and deservedly so.  Lumet is a brilliant director.\n\nIt was a critique on news media that tried to demonstrate how ratings rule all in television, even news media.  Basically it takes a comical spin on one unbalanced man's realization that sensationalism is more important that REAL news to most news media outlets.  He unintentionally finds a unique way to get everybody's attention and boost his own ratings the day that he finds out that he will be fired the next day.  He takes this newfound publicity and tries to expose to the news media to his viewers as a monster that he helped create.  People begin to rally around his charged speeches.

It was warm for a while, like back in March, and now it is cold again (like 60's and 70s). it is June it should be much warmer than this for this time of year. \nWill it ever get warm again?? Why is the weather like this? I thought ""global warming"" was supposed to be raising the normal highs....temps are below normal! ; The problem with the entire ""global warming"" concept is that it's net Earth warming- in fact, it can be a lot cooler in one place and warmer in another, and it averages out to be above average temperature.\n\nWeather and climate are funny things... they can change at moment's notice.  Currently, it's cooler up north because of the position of the subtropical jet stream.  This has dropped south, giving us milder, cooler air that is circulating from Canada and other areas.  Normally, the subtropical jet is further north then it is right now, giving us warmer temperatures as we recieve air from the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nSo, it's milder because of the prevailing wind patterns.

6,"how to make friend easier and more natural? ; to make friends ; Talking is probably the largest factor I can think of.\n\nTo keep the other person interested in a conversation don't talk about yourself too much. Ask questions to get to know the person better, talk about any interests you have, classes, guys/girls, parents, etc. Becoming genuinely interested in the other person.\n\nA somewhat easy way to get a conversation started is to make a short complaint about something that you know the other person doesn't like. Generally the other person will complain too and you'll have you're conversation. You have to be Very careful not to do this often because you don't want the other person to think you're a whiner.\n\nPay Attention to what the other person says! This one is Extremely useful as you can bring it up at a later time and the other person will be surprised and pleased that you remembered.\n\nContinue to speak to everyone you know regularly. If you are walking and see someone you haven’t talked to in a while, stop for a moment and talk to them. It does not have to be a long conversation, just say hello, see how they are doing and if anything is wrong. You would be surprised by how little effort is required to win the friendship of others when you require nothing of them.\n\nBe nice and generally try to end the conversation on a good note. You don't have to make sure the other person has a great time Every Single conversation, but you don't want to think of all the petty arguements they've had with you.\n\nArguements... Don't. There are VERY few 'good' arguements. ""The only way to get the berst of an arguement is to avoid it.""\nIf you're wrong, admit it.\n\nDO NOT critize the person, or a friend, when talking to the person. If you want to point out something they did wrong, try to point out something similar you did wrong.\n\nSmile! Not a forced smile, the person you're talking to will be able to tell the difference. And you don't have to be an overly happy hyper-active person. Just smile naturally and, if you can, be somewhat happy. Remembering good times with your friends/family can help.\n\nLet the other person do a lot of the talking and be a good listener. (Somewhat stated in my first advice, ask questions, talk about interests the other person has. Answer questions sincerly.)\n\nHonestly make the person you're talking to feel important. You don't want to fake this one or do it too often, but if you honestly think they did something well, give them that praise.\n\nIf you want more advice, there are a couple good books that Will actually help. How to Win Friends and Influence People, is probably one of the best ones. It's an old book, but trust me, it's just as useful today as it was when it was written.",93
7,"Who is Johnny Cash? ; Who is Johnny Cash? ; Johnny Cash was a country and rock musician who died in 2003.  He had a pretty long career, got his start around the same time as guys like Elvis.

1,"If magnetic field of earth is changing continuosly would that effect bird migration patterns?? ; if polarity of earth is changed upside down, would that effect the birds?? ; That is a good question. Some birds and some insects use the magnetic field of the earth to give them clues for navigation, along with landmarks, and polarization of light etc. My guess is that at first they might be a little confused, but they use multiple clues, so they would soon adjust and learn the new pattern. \n\nAfter all, it flips fairly often on earth's time scale.  Apparently on average it flips every 300,000 years, and  the last flip was 780,000 years ago, so we are a bit overdue at the moment.

0,"Your religion and population? ; I always wandered what drives people that live poor, in lack of health, food, infrastructure,..., to have many children. I know sometimes it is religion, but I would like to dig deeper here. I know it is also poverty, lack of knowledge, lack of education on contraception, so I am focusing on religion and its role. An example (due to the sensitivity of the issue, I will not state the country): religious people do not work here, do not pay taxes, and live really in modesty, many times in hunger. But their religion tells them to have many children, therefore many of religious families have more than 8 children - who live poor, in lack of food, lack of proper education,... I do not understand this. I myself love children, would love to have 4, but do not have job, I am 28, therefore I do not want to have my first child yet. Even if my religion is telling me 'children are a gift from God', I am sorry, but to me it is not responsible to have them yet or to have many. ????? ; I agree with you, I often wonder, in Africa for example where christianity is rising, why the pope still claims contraception is wrong when encouraging it would help stabilize the countries HIV/Aids epidemic and could also help the countries economy in the long run - having less children means the children they have are better fed, they can afford some sort of education as they have a couple of children to send to school. These children once educated could get better jobs and the cycle carries on. \nIf I was living in poverty I wouldn't have so many children as it is selfish - having them just because you want so many and your religion tells you to do so.

While the law school accreditation requirements of the ABA require students to have three years of undergraduate work before being admitted, the majority of American law schools now are members of the Association of American Law Schools, which requires that law school applicants hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university prior to graduation from law school.

1,"Is this possible to know about future by Einstein's Time Traveler / The twin paradox theory? ; I am very curious about this topic, or tell me if any other possibilities to know about future atleast theoretically. ; In fact we indeed are traveling in time. But, only in one direction, i.e., towards the future; and that too, with a certain fixed 'speed' (call it, spending one second per second). Do you understand what I am saying? I am saying that we can not move backward towards our past, and , we have no control over the passage of time.\n\nThe special theory of relativity, however suggests a theoretical method to control the passage of time: Time dilation, which requires moving with speeds around the speed of light. The theory holds that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. However, this effect allows ""time travel"" only toward the future: never backward. \n\nMany in the scientific community believe that time travel is highly unlikely. This belief is largely due to Occam's Razor. Any theory which would allow time travel would require that issues of causality be resolved. What happens if you try to go back in time and kill your grandfather. Also, in the absence of any experimental evidence that time travel exists, it is theoretically simpler to assume that it does not happen. Indeed, Stephen Hawking once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel - a variant of the Fermi paradox, with time travelers instead of alien visitors. However, assuming that time travel cannot happen is also interesting to physicists because it opens up the question of why and what physical laws exist to prevent time travel from occurring. \n\nFrom the above note, one can note two points:\n1. Time-travel is highly unlikely, and,\n2. Possibly, it is uni-directional (towards the future, not back to past).\n\nSo, it seems that knowing the future by visiting it is either not possible, or, once you are in your future, you can't come back to present to tell your friends that you know the future!!!\n\nPartly, knowing the future theoretically, is perhaps possible if you understand and meticulously use the principle of causality.",254

9,"Wat is the protectionist policy followed by US and other developed countries part of WTO? ; and why isnt free trade good for everyone? ; I am assuming you are referring to trade policy.  Protectionist policies are those that advantage domestic goods over foreign goods (exports v imports) through either tarriffs (surcharges added to the price of a good being imported) or through subsidies (price supports or distributive policies within a country) to grow or make some item.\nObviously, similiar to the micro level of a larger grocery store being able to get better prices when negotiating with its suppliers compared to a smaller chain or a 'mom & pop' type store, larger countries (typically first world) are better positioned to DICTATE supply agreements (not much can be done about demand---other than to decrease it through tarriffs (VAT) which would be passed on to the consumer).  \nThird and second world countries are often in a very tenuous position:  their government wants to expand their economy through increasing exports, however, often this is done through either internally, creating subsidies (which many cannot afford to do) or agreeing to 'lopsided' trade agreements, which wind up exploiting or at a minimum, disadvantaging their citizens and other workers in their respective countries or nations.  Additionally, there are contravening issues like human rights and environmental standards which may also be of concern.\nI hope this helps, but here are some articles for you to read and consider; as well as the WTO link",341

Republicans don’t seem to be aware of the chain reaction caused by neglecting the needy, but they end up paying for this neglect with higher crime rates, paying higher medical costs, and paying for higher prison populations.  They appear to be oblivious of the repercussions of having a society with a wide gap between poverty and wealth.\n\nThey tend to be less realistic.  They live their lives in a box; not looking outside of the box to get the big picture.  As long as them and their children have good health care, plenty of food, good educations and a comfortable living, they don’t see anything wrong.\n\nThis narrow view of the world causes America’s needy children to be neglected, people to go without proper housing, educations and health care.  In the long run they pay for this neglect, but can’t see beyond the box.\n\nAs for morality, I’ve never seen so much hypocrisy.  On one hand they claim to be such great Christians while on the other they ignore the teachings of Jesus which commanded we must take care of our neighbor, feed the hungry, and care for the sick.\n\nRepublicans live in a fantasy world and when their house gets broken into or they have to pay outrages hospital bills, they wonder why these things happen.",351

3,"answer the question below? ; To win a play-off championship, a team must win the best out of five games. Whichever team wins three games first wins the series.

For example, WWW (win, win, win) is the only way for the 3 games straight, but the 3 games out of 4 can be LWWW (lose, win, win, win) or WLWW or WWLW.

Recruiters lie, they have no say in where you're assigned or what your duties will be.\n\nAviation mechanics are actually in fairly high demand from what I understand - but I don't have any close contacts in the Navy any more, so I can't say what the odds are of you getting that posting, just that the odds are better than they would be if you wanted to be a photographer or something like that.\n\nWhen you are posted to a land base, you can either stay in base housing (barracks) or you will get a housing allowance for off-base housing.  It may not entirely cover the rent and probably won't cover insurance, particularly when you're first starting out and you're low-ranked, but it can make the ends meet if you're clever with your money.  Specialist rankings like aviation mechanics tend to be higher ranked and therefore better paid, which is probably the situation your friend is in.\n\nRemember that wherever you are, you'll be leaving in 2-3 years.  That's one reason that a lot of young guys just don't bother with getting off-base housing, they know they'll just have to leave and they'd rather not spend the money on rent or a mortgage.  Remember also that as an aviation mechanic, you will be expected to spend time on carriers unless you specialize in the big birds, which has its own problems.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with the dangers and the difficulties, go for it - but don't go in expecting to get paid just for breathing and showing up.  The Navy works its people hard, and expects a lot from them, and if you aren't willing to do the job they have ways of dealing with you that a civilian boss doesn't.",395

1,"why have the mental illnesses not been removed during evolution through natural selection like other genes? ; Schizophrenia is a common disease found in all human cultural societies. This may be explained by the evolution. There seems to be a connection between the genes behind mental illness, and creativity. Many famous artists have for instance been schizophrenic. ""Without their genes man might still live in caves."" (Statement made by the Icelandic scientist Jon Karlsson about mentally ill persons and their relatives.) Mental diseases are documented far back in history and occur in all human cultures. Schizophrenia is the result of a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. But why have the mental illnesses not been removed during evolution through natural selection, the way unfavorable genes usually are? ; Let's name three genes A/a, B/b, C/c. Capitals indicate the dominant one. Let's say you need a aa bb cc combination to be schizophrenic. \n\nPeople who have any of the recessives is smarter than average. Those with two recessives are geniuses. Those with three, crazy. Let's say the recessive is 1/10th as common as the dominant.\n\nThen we have ratios: ABC = 72.9%, aBC/AbC/ABc = 24.3%, abC/aBc/Abc = 2.7%, abc = 0.1%.\n\nWhich means we have one out of four people be ""above average"" in intelligence, 1 out of 40 to be genius or near-genius, and one out of a thousand to be schizophrenic.\n\nThe biological pay-off of the genes reaches an equilibrium at the point where the benefits to the species (above average, geniuses) outweigh the harm (schizophrenics); in other words, when the benefits are maximized.\n\nWere these recessive genes to disappear, not only would the schizophrenics go away, but also the geniuses. Were these genes to be even less common, the ratio of geniuses would be to low to produce any real benefit to the species.",447

4,"how do i resolve undetermined externals in C++ ?? ; I am working on a project right now.. and i am getting 1 unresolved external error.. what can i do to fix this? ; There are a few typical reasons for unresolved\nexternals in C++.  \n\nThe simplist cause is that you forgot to link in a\nrequired library.  I'm not proficient with Windows,\nbut on a Unix/Linux/Solaris machine, you can search\nthrough libraries using ""nm"" to find the missing\nsymbol (and then specify that library on your linker\ninvocation).\n\nMaybe the next simplist cause would be that you\nactually are missing a symbol (ie. because of an\n#ifdef or some oversight in your Makefile, some\nsource file didn't compile).  Look for the symbol\nin the source and make sure that file is correctly\ncompiled.  [By the way, it is quite possible that\nyour linker will report ""mangled"" names which\nincorporate the class hierarchy of the type of\nthe symbol.  You may wish to filter your linker\noutput through something to reconstitute the\noriginal symbol name.  On many systems, this filter\nis called ""c++filt"", but I've also seen it called\n""dem"" (as in demangler).]\n\nFinally, in C++, I've seen another cause of unresolved\nsymbols being short-comings in the template instantiation\nsystem.  In the general case, the compilation system\nshould detect the use of templates and create the\nnecessary versions where and when needed, but some\ncompilers provide more limited support.  In those cases,\nit may be necessary to explicitly instantiate the \nmissing template.  Take a good look at the unresolved\nsymbol (particularly if you can ""demangle"" the name)\nto see if it looks like it should be provided by one\nof your (or the system's) templates.  That would be\nthe clue that this is an instantiation problem.",592

Every user action that normally would generate an HTTP request takes the form of a JavaScript call to the Ajax engine instead. Any response to a user action that doesn’t require a trip back to the server — such as simple data validation, editing data in memory, and even some navigation — the engine handles on its own. If the engine needs something from the server in order to respond — if it’s submitting data for processing, loading additional interface code, or retrieving new data — the engine makes those requests asynchronously, usually using XML, without stalling a user’s interaction with the application.\n\najax is being used by google for its various services like Gmail,Google Suggest.

2,"Personality.? ; What is the the difference between a personality disorder, a borderline personality and why? Which is the toughest to assist and why? No websites please. ; ""Borderline Personality"" IS a personality disorder.  It's commonly misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder.  In some cases, it is used simply because it is a mix of many other disorders.\nA person with BPD is, in essence, self destructive.  Some may be sexually promiscuous, abuse drugs and/or alcohol, self-mutilate, and engage in compulsive behavior.\nA person with borderline personality is a hard case for most any doctor.  Some doctors agree that a borderline personality is hardest to treat because it takes so much to gain the patients trust.  This is because most people with BPD were abused (either sexually, physically, or emotionally) as children.  After the patients trust is gained, the patients and doctor then try to overcome compulsive behavior, a hard thing for any BPD to accomplish.\nAll in all, a borderline personality makes it difficult for others to assist in that they see everything in black and white; a person who is not their hero is their enemy, and can quickly become one or the other.",625

3,"Do the buttons you push to cross the street really do anything? ; You push them over and over, but do they really do anything?? ; Here is how I think it works.\n\nThe Pedestrian Stoplights and Traffic Stoplights have set schedules. For example, the traffic light and pedestrian light have a 3:1 minute ratio. Let's pretend the schedule starts at 12:00, the traffic light will be green from 12:00 to 12:03. Then the pedestrian light will be green from 12:03 to 12:04. The cycle continues: 12:04-12:07 is Traffic while the pedestrian is 12:07-12:08.\n\nNow I assume the pedestrian traffic light button has like an ""idle function"". For example, maybe if the button isn't pressed after 45 seconds then it becomes idle and the (12:03-12:04 section) will remain the green for traffic light. However, lets say you press the button at 12:05, the pedestrian light will not turn green until 12:07 because pressing the button doesn't change the light but brings it off idle and into the schedule.\n\nNow I didn't research this, it's just my assumption. I just thought about it a lot from standing at pedestrian light buttons a lot.  :)",647

That's generally the number one problem I see in students that are having trouble motivating themselves to study - they're just not interested enough in the material.  If you're still a freshman or a sophomore and struggling with your lib ed requirements, that's understandable - but, if you're also having trouble studying for the classes in your major, then you may want to reassess.  I was in the same boat as you about 5 years ago.  Every time I tried to sit down and study, this wave of lethargy would sweep over me, making me very tired.  I've never napped so much as I did those first couple years of college.  I finally realized that I had less than no interest in the classes I was supposed to be really interested in, and took some time off to figure things out.

6,"what is meant by forex trading?what is meant by futures and options? ; forex trading means trading in foriegn exchange. ; So i guess you know what forex trading is.\n\nFutures and options and forwrds, the easiest, are a kind of derivatives. Derivatives are a financial instrument whose value derives form the value of other, more basic underlying assets.\n\nNow, forwards are contracts in which the price of a commodity or currency is set for the future. It has to do with expectations of the market, and how the market thinks, based on information today, the price of those commodities or currencies will be in a certain date.\nLets say the exchange rate of mexican pesos for us dollars today is $11.09. That´s the spot exchange rate. Now, lets say you and i agree that in june 2006, im your gonna sell me american dollars at an exchange rate of $11.1828. If my expectation is the peso will be higher, im gonna make a deal with you. So, the future of the pedo, for june 2006 will be $11.1828. Imagine our deal, but not made between us, but between thousands of dealers, in the Chicago MArket.\nCompanies use futures a lot as a way to protect themselves. I believe in english its called hedging. If an american firm sells water tanks to a firm in France, but the payment isnt due untill 45 days later, both companies would like to agree to make the exchange of euros for us dollars at a future exchange rate. That way they now exactly how much they owe or get. The same with commodity prices. A future of the price of oil is nothing more than a contract agreeing on the future price of the transaction. Funny thing is, you and i can agree on an oils future contract, where im selling and your buying, but the barrel of oil is never transacted. What we do is, lets say the future price of oil for august is $73 usd. im selling, you are buying, and we agree on that price. Come august 31st, the real price of oil is $78 usd. since you are buying, you win $5 bucks per barrel right? And i lose % per barrel... so instead of giving you a barrel of oil you cannot even store, i just give you $5 per barrel. _If the real price had been $65, i would have won $8 per barrel, and you lose $8 per barrel.\n\nThe same with futures. MAjor difference with forwards is that an exchange of assets is required. Contracts are pretty much standarized. The delivery, kind and quality of product, etc is all defined. Largest exchanges are made in the Chicago Board Trade. Futures include a los of prodcts... live cattle, sugar, coffee, gold, cooper, aluminium, etc.\n\nOptions are a little bit harder. There are 2 basic type of options: call options, giving the holder the right, option, to buy an asset at a certain date at a certain price. Put options, giving the holder the right, option, to sell an asset at a certain date at a certain price. For example, lets say i buy a call option to buy in 3 months stock of yahoo. The actual price is, just an example, $10 bucks, and my call option gives me the option to buy at $12. The price to buy that option for 1 share of yahoo is worth $1. If 3 months pass, and the price of the stock is $11, i certainly wont take my option to buy the stock and lose $1, the initial investment on the option. But if the real price is $15, im going to take my option, buy the stock at $12 and sell it at $15, earning $2. \nJust be careful cause there are american options and european options... european options can only be excersied at the end of the contract, ehile american options can be excercised whenever in the life of the option.",702

1,"Why is there are sonic boom when planes make the sound barrier? ; What causes the sound? ; A sonic boom is the audible component of a shock wave in air. The term is commonly used to refer to the air shocks caused by the supersonic flight of military aircraft or passenger transports such as Concorde (Mach 2.03, no longer flying) and the Space Shuttle (Mach 27, has only flown once since the 2003 crash). Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of sound energy, sounding much like an explosion; typically the shock front may approach 167 megawatts per square meter, and may exceed 200 decibels.\n\nWhen an aircraft is near the sound barrier, an unusual cloud sometimes forms in its wake. A Prandtl-Glauert Singularity results from a drop in pressure, because of shock wave formation. This pressure change causes a sharp drop in temperature, which in humid conditions leads the water vapor in the air to condense into droplets and form the cloud",732

My friend who is a year older and went there told me that ""everyone"" plays Ultimate at Stuy. Being impressionable and younger, I figured I better learn too. I played for the boys' Sticky Fingers team through high school. I got to play at the high school national championships back when it was held in Washington DC.\n\nAfter high school, I went to Oberlin College in Ohio. I continued my Ultimate career by attending early season tryouts for the college team. There were barely enough people on the team to play 7-on-7 full size games. We played co-ed (mixed gender) in the fall, then single-gender in the spring (collegiate championships season). I eventually went on to captain the team, and the men's team made it to College Nationals.\n\nAfter college, I moved to Seattle, Washington, where I tried out for, but didn't make the second tier men's club team. I spent a season getting serious about training, and eventually made it onto one of the second tier teams. Continuing on with training, I eventually made it on to the top men's team in town. The team qualified for the club national championships where we finished second - losing to some team from Boston in the finals. I was put in for one point that game.

It is also about different types starting from a weak feeling through affection to love. \n\nLove between siblings obviously is different from love between husband and wife. The expression of pre-marital love is of course of different from expressions of love and affection within marriage. \n\nLove for parents is more to do with respect, honour and responsibilities. \n\nLove for prophets is superior to love for own life. \n\nLove for own life and for prophets both are again of different forms than love for the Creator. It is completely a different type.\n\nWe also have love for our neighbours, love for a region or regions or for a club and so on. Not all forms of love need verbal expressions.\n\nLike, one loves to hate or loves to respect.\nMy expression of love to my brother could be helping him in his need or if he does not have a need perhaps to help him proceed and so on. These are non-verbal forms of expressions. \n\nIf one has to tell everyday a person of love that one loves him or her, it would often be a symptom of insecure feeling by at least one of them needing daily reassurance. However, in human science there is no fixed formula. Some people are just psychologically vulnerable they need constant re-assurance or verbal expression.\n\nSpontaneous, cordial, whole hearty behaviour to persons we encounter could be a mixture of expression.",937

1,"How does consuming alcohol affect ones body temperature, particularly in cold conditions? ; I am a bicycle messenger in Edmonton, Alberta Canada. Tommorow the temperature is supposed to be -30 Celsius. Also it will snow and be a slow day. So to keep warm is it really a good idea to take a flask of scotch on route?\nWhat would be the best alternatives as far as diet is concerned for maximum heat? ; Contrary to what is believed, alcohol may make you feel warmer but it actually lowers the temperature of the body. When alcohol enters the blood, it causes the blood vessels to widen.  More blood flows to the skin's surface.  The drinker's body temperature drops as the increased blood flow to the surface allows body heat to escape.  People who drink alcohol in cold weather to get warm actually accomplish the opposite.\n\nThough carbohydrates are known to be the best source of heat and energy, all what you eat are actually contributing in producing your body heat. So eat a well balanced diet and wear sufficient clothing to combat coldness while you go out. Instead of bringing a flask of scotch on route why not bring a flask of hot drinks instead?☺",960

And the reason a Christian dates is for the sole purpose of getting married.  He sounds manic.  He needs medication.  You should pray for him, but like the other woman said, get away from him.  You won't be deserting him.  He'll live.  And perhaps his aunt and uncle do have it good, but it's not about what we have here on earth.  It's about what we get after death, and the saved individual gets eternal life in heaven with Christ.  Tell your boyfriend to stick his foot in a burning fire, and then ask him if he wants to spend eternity with his whole body in there.  Yes, it does seem like nonbelievers are just as blessed as Christians.  But just think about what comes after you die.  Remember, you're a stranger here.  You don't belong here.

When sexual abuse happens a person's sense of themselves, esteem, their understanding of healthy boundaries are completely screwed up.  This is why THERAPY is SO important.  You cannot blame yourself for what happened with your father.  Your need to want to do anything to keep him comes as a product of your earlier abuse.  The line between appropriate and inappropriate - and being able to say NO - got lost when it happened to you earlier.  Generally people who go on for years without help will find themselves in positions where they are taken advantage of (and allow that to happen - because they don't realize it at the time) and until you get the help - this will continue to happen.  \n\nShame is a huge piece of this.  Your father is an adult too and he should have known better (if not more) than to have sex with his own daughter.  You cannot blame yourself. It sounds like you need to do a lot of forgiving of yourself.  Please go and get some help - if you don't you will continue to live in this cycle of pain and shame and only you will be to blame.  What happened to you was awful - but you are an adult now and have the means to get the help you couldn't when you were younger.  There are many support groups that are free, and counselling offered - talk to friends - your doctor - look in the phone book and call up different places.  Ask lots of questions. In the meantime you can't change what happened with your father - you made a mistake - but YOU are NOT a mistake.  Stop being hard on yourself.  The past is the past - try and put it there for a while and go and focus on your own healing.  Most of all try and have compassion for yourself.

9,"What's the difference in what Cortez did to the Aztecs and other nations did to the natives of the current US? ; Here is an excerpt from a book I just read about Cortez's defeat of the Aztecs.

It lay, a heap of ruins, a charnel-house containing thousands of unburied corpses.  Its overthrow was a masterpiece of military genius, valor and enterprise. Everyone knew it would take its place among immortal deeds of arms and felt proud to have had a share in it. Too bad that the once-glittering valley with its palaces, gardens, cities and temples had been laid waste, but such was war.\n\nI would deduce from that that the Spanish were also conquering immigrants that completely destroyed the civilizations that existed before their arrival.\n\nTherefore, I would suggest folks no longer use the ""all US citizens with the exception of natives are immigrants"" argument. ; There isn't any difference.

Do I have a pretty good chance at getting into one of these with this? What is this score equivelant to compared to the old SAT? I also got a 26 on the ACT. Which score do you think I should submit? ; That SAT score puts you around the 80 percentile which isn't bad.  Under the old system I think it would have been around an 1200.  A 26 on the ACT puts you very near the 80% percentile as well if I'm not mistaken.  Both of those are ""above average"" scores.\n\nAs far as whether that will get you into UT Austin the answer is probably not by itself. It's still worth a shot however, just be sure to include the best references and essay you can.\n\nI applied to UTA and Texas A&M with slightly higher scores (1280 under the old system and a 28ACT) and was declined but they both offered to let me attend satellite schools on a kind of probationary period with the option of transferring to the central schools after a year.  \n\nI ended up getting a free ride at UT Tyler and have enjoyed it enough that I never pursued transferring to Austin.  \n\nI’m not familiar enough with Miami or Pepperdine to answer that part of your question but I hope this helps.\n\nBest of Luck!\nArmus",1097

Typing isn't just slow in Word. It's slow in emails and on the Web and everything else. Is there anything I can do to speed it up? I have Mac OS Extended. ; A G3 isn't exactly the lastest in computer technology.  Your processor is about what 700/800MHz right? and I think they have about 32/64MB of RAM so the applications you have installed could really be killing you processing power.  Despite all that though, the slow typing is a syptom of something much bigger than just a few applications hogging your resources since it doesn't take much processing power to output to screen.  You most likely have a ton of spyware on your system that's sending nformation all over the net about you and your machine and your kids.  The best way to remove this is an antivirus program with spyware checkers (most of them have that now) or you can get a dedicated spyware checker like ad-aware but I'll prefer the antivirus so that you could scan for viruses as well.  Most big name developers like Norton and McAfee have versions for both Mac OS and Windows and I'm pretty sure Apple have it's own antivirus program on thier site or some patches or something so you shouldn't have to much trouble locating one.",1110

3,"Can you help me discussing the arguments for/against statement? ; Corporate social responsibility is essential as a philosophy to guide managers in travel industry. ; I'll give you an example of where practices were changed which essentially adopted corporate social responsibility where it hadn't previously existed:\n\nIn Cusco (Peru) tour operators used to compete to offer the cheapest tours of the Inca Trail - especially in the immediate aftermath following the ban on independent trekkers doing the Trail.  All tour operators had porters - whether they carried just the dining tent, cooking gear and food and did the cooking at camp, or whether they carried trekkers gear as well.  \n\nMost of these porters were employed on an ad hoc basis and came from the poor villages just before the Trail starts.  They are renowned for literally running up and down the mountain passes wearing flip flops made out of used tyres.  The problems came with the fact that they were employed ad hoc and the pay varied greatly.  Trekkers ended up arguing with tour operators when they learnt that their porters were earning less than porters with other companies and carrying twice the recommended weights - borne out by frequent sightings of porters tumbling down mountains as the weight they were carrying toppled them.\n\nGuidelines were eventually introduced recommending maximum weights for porters to carry and essentially a minimum wage and tour operators who did not comply with this were not licensed to continue with tours of the Inca Trail so they all pulled their finger out and started treating the porters better. \n\nAdded to this were increased regulations about things like eco-tourism - i.e. taking waste away, and digging toilets to recommended depths.\n\nThis is a practical example of how corporate social responsibility in a developing country at its largest tourist centre improved not only the experience of the Inca Trail, but the conditions for those porters employed to work the Trail.  The against argument in this circumstance I guess is that people had willingly booked those cheaper tours and not all will have been distressed by the treatment of the porters or the lack of eco-responsibility. \n\nHope that's of some help.  Good luck.",1179

Again taxes \nhelp the US.\n\nLegal or not most immgrants cannot \nqualify for public assistance \nprograms for many reasons. \n\nTherefore the people out there who \nthink that immigrants are draining \nthe system need to stop watching Fox \nNews and read research papers \nand look a governmental spending \nrecords and history.\n\nIllegal immigrants don't apply for \npublic services because they \ndon't want to get caught by the \ngoverment and get deported. \nImmigrants like most poor people \nonly go to the hospital when \nthey are really sick or its too \nlate. This is just a flaw in the \nsystem. \n\nIts the same with education most \nreccent immigrants do not \nsend their kids to public schools. \nI hate to say that America \nis stupid country for funding \nmost of it schools by property \ntaxes. Other countries around \nthe world use several methods \nof raising money for their schools.\n\nWhat is really  happening in our \ngreat country is not immigrants! \nIt's our political leaders! \nImmigrants are not the sole cause \nof what is bad in this country!\n\nFor one, they are the ones out \nthere busting their asses to make \npeanuts. They work all the jobs \nthat Americans would cry and \ncomplain about if they worked \nthose types of jobs (picking \nproduce in the fields, \nconstruction, and other hard \nmanuel labor)\n\nWe are all immigrants (unless \nyour a Native American) \nand America wouldn't be  what is \nnow, without immigrants, \nlegal or not!\n \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_the_United_States_of_America\n\nYes...there are bad immigrants who \nbreak the law (steal, rob, \nmurder, drug dealers, illegal gun \ndealers and such) \nBUT most are hard working people \nwho want a better life. \nI have benn around INS for quite some\ntime now and It is irrational how people that \nactually know about immigration \nlaws, such as federal immigration \njudges, immigration lawyers and \nlots of people that work for the \nINS are in favor of immigration as \nlong as it is \ndone legally, but the goverment and congress\nare not makin any progress on laws that\nwould promote to legalize illegal aliens\nsuch an amnesty, but yet the congressmen \nand the president are \ndiscriminating illegal immigrants and \nblaming them for draining \nthe system, when they know that the \nactual cause of all the economic \nproblems here in the US is war on \nIrak that bush started a few years \nback.\n\nDo you people realized that he spent \n200 billion dollars on the Irak war \nalready, that is a lot more than \nanyone could expected, including Bush, \nand now you see on the news that \nillegal immigrants dont pay taxes and \nthat they drain the system, when Legal\nor not most immgrants cannot qualify for\npublic assistance programs, and \nthe real truth is that\nthere is more white people living \non welfare than any other minority, \nand that includes African-american, \nHispanic and Asian, \nIllegal immigrants do pay taxes \nwhenever they go to the store \nwhen they get their paychecks \nthey get a tax cut also, \n\nAnd can you tell me when do \nthey get those taxes back?  hardly \nnever \nbecause the majority of immigrants \ndont know how to declare their \ntaxes but there is also Illegal \nimmigrants that declare their \nincome taxes and that is completely\n legal just do some research on \nhow being an illegal immigrant \nyou still have the\nresponsability and the right to \ndo your income taxes just like \nanyone else livin in this country, \nbut no one has the time to look at \nrecords see for themselfs the real\ntruth.\nThe truth is that the \ngoverment is making once again the\nwrong choice or just looking\nto blame the immigrants because he\nspent to much money in the Irak war\nbut instead of spendi",1195

2,"persistent shoulder pain, for years... should I get rotator cuff surgery? Your experiences with it? ; I have inflammation and pain in my rotator cuff, going back years.  Now that I'm actively weight training again, it's really bothering me and affecting my quality of life.  Before restarting weight training, the pain was merely a minor nuisance, something I could easily live with.  I had it looked at, and the doctors basically said I could come in and get steroid injections every couple of months to manage the pain, or I could have rotator cuff surgery.  I've talked to a few folks that have had the surgery, and NONE of them have anything good to say about it.  They said the post-operative pain was bad, and it took several months or longer to heal.  What do you think? ; Basically you have 2 choices stop doing activities that cause you pain or have the surgery.  The surgery consists of a plastic screw being inserted into the shoulder, the tendon is then weaved into another piece of flat plastic that is then attached to the screw to hold the tendon into place.  The recuperation time is around 6 months and you'll need physical therapy during that time.  It takes along time to heal because there's no way to actually reattach the tendon permanently.  The plastic just holds it into place while the tendon reattaches itself to the bone.  The pain of the surgery can be quite intense but pain medication is provided.\nHope this  helps.",1210

I was highly motivated to quit because I was scheduled for elective surgery and I understood that stopping smoking was the single best thing I could do to increase my chances for a successful surgical outcome.  \n\nResearch has indicated that using nic replacement increases the successs rate of quit attempts.  I had tried to stop cold turkey several times but always fell off the wagon and had given up trying - until my surgery date was looming.  Amazing how that motivates a person!\n\nI never tried this drug but some quitters have also been helped by using the drug Wellbutrin, a prescription medication.  Some have combined it with nic replacement to increase their chance of success.\n\nI guess the best advice I could give is that if you fail, try again.  Every attempt to quit, whether you last a week or a month, gives you useful experience and information about your habit and what smoking does for you that can help you the next time you try.  Don't stop trying.\n\nOn the issue of weight gain, I found that I have a strong oral craving - if it isn't a cigarette in my mouth, then it's food.  With oral nic replacement products (gum or lozenges) there is less likelihood that you'll overeat because the oral cravings are somewhat satisfied by the nic replacement product.  This isn't the case, of course, with the patch.  I didn't gain weight during the time I used nic gum.  I did gain about 10 lbs later.  Unless you eat yourself out of house and home, there is no reason to gain a lot of weight (I don't consider 10 lbs. a lot of weight).  However, if you eat instead of smoking, then yes, gaining weight is likely.  I took up walking instead of smoking.  Anything but eating!",1344

For example a Roman once travelled and looked for the Khilafah Omar (may Allah be pleased with him) and saw him lying asleep in a tent by himself with no gaurds. They realized that only someone who was ruling by justice could feel so safe within his own kingdom.\n\nLater on the state started deteriorating, and rose again with the ottoman empire.\n\nThe state completely fell with the fall of the ottoman empire, when the Islamic world was broken up into nationalistic states by Britain. This is what the present situation is today.\n\nFor more information on how things are run in an Islamic state, in general, based upon the history of Islam, I advise you to look into the book, Social Justice in Islam, by Sayyed Qutb (may Allah have mercy on him).",1374

(eg. public service ads).\n\n\nPlease also see similar question on use of silence... ; Music is a vitally important ingredient in TV advertising. To see how cleverly it is used, record a few on video and play them over a few times. My best example is Pampers where a mother asks a baby to get up from the floor and walk over to her and father says the baby cannot move because of the nappy. The music is baby-like during this phase. The ad then cuts to the benefits of Pampers and then back to the baby who does get up and walk across the room. Almost imperceptibly, the music changes to a kind of triumphal sound. On one watching, you would be unaware of it. Only by playing the ad over can you hear the mood that is created. In answer to your other questions, try replaying and noting how many different camera set ups there were in a 15 or 30 second ad, then analyse the story being told, then listen to see how sound, including music, adds atmosphere.",1459

Understanding and empathizing with social norms allows one's perspective to be framed in acceptable ways.\n\nThey are also evaluating the basis for social norms for predictability and for consistency, while ensuring that their own basis is more firmly grounded.

He did so. A year later, my friend got a letter from Getty Images saying, in a nutshell, that he owes them $1000 because he has a copyrighted image on his website. There was no prior cease-and-desist letter, though they apparently knew he started using the picture a year ago. He called the web designer, who said that he grabbed the image off a free-image website via a Google search (he can no longer locate that particular website), and that the image has no copyright imprint on it. He's not sure what to do and has until Dec. 1 to pay, oer Getty Images' demand letter. Anyone know what he should do? Your advice would be greatly appreciated. ; Advice: Get an attorney.\nThis really depends upon any contract he had with the website developer.  There could be an argument that, in absence of a ""work for hire"" agreement, that the webdesigner owns the copyright on the website, and your friend's business shouldn't be sued.  Certainly, there's an argument that the web designer has to indemnify your friend (i.e. pay for any damages) for his own intentional actions -- like copyright infringement.\n(P.S. an image does not necessarily have to have a copyright imprint on it to be copyrighted.  This may raise the issue of ""innocent"" infringement, which may lower statutory damages, but probably will not change the analysis much in this instance, where there is a definite market for the images.)  \nSo, have your friend get a lawyer; and if he cannot get a lawyer by December 1, have him write back and say that he is in the process of getting an attorney who will get back to him by _____. Although attorneys often send demand letters with fast deadlines, they usually (read: USUALLY) do not take further legal action right away if they receive some response (because it's always cheaper to settle these issues than it is to file suit and litigate).\nIf your friend cannot afford an attorney, just make sure he keeps in contact with the other side. These sorts of disputes are rarely settled for the first demand.  (Your friend can consider a counteroffer based on the use of the image, or agree to pay a much smaller license fee and remove the image, for example.) Your friend also needs to forward this to the web designer to put him on notice that the web designer may be on the hook to indemnify for these damages.\nGet an attorney.",1550

1,"when u replace a balloon with less dense hydrogen, does the bouyant force on the ballon change if the balloon? ; remains the same size? Explain. ; Not sure if I understand. You're going to replace the old hydrogen with some new hydrogen that's less dense? The only way for the density of hydrogen to be less is if the pressure is lower or the temperature is higher. Since this is a balloon, the pressure has to match the pressure of the atmosphere. \n\nSo I'll assume the new hydrogen is at a higher temperature. In that case, the balloon can be kept inflated to the same size with fewer molecules. Therefore the mass of the hydrogen will be less because there is less of it. So the bouyancy will increase. The balloon as a whole is less dense so it is more bouyant.",1565

1,"How can a spider, bug, ant etc. have a life behaviour of incredible complexity with such a small brain? ; For example, a spider can have a very complex behaviour similar to us, and even more spectacular: it hunts, build structures, have conflicts with other spiders, and even dance !\nA termite colony can live in complex societies, with over 10000 inhabitants. ; Invertebrates can manage this apparent degree of complexity because so much of their behaviour is instinctive. It is preprogrammed into their brains before hatching and is largely unchanging.  That method of storage is highly efficient because the macroscopic brain structure itself can be tailored to support it. This allows for very complex behaviours with relatively little brain mass. The downside is that the animals have little ability to learn and even less ability to respond to change.\n\nIn contrast mammals have very few preprogrammed behaviours, instead they learn most of what they need to know through experience. That makes mammals extremely flexible animals compared to most invertebrates because they can tailor all their behaviour to circumstances. The downside is that it requires a large brain to allow for all the possible circumstances the animal might meet.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider something like the ;structures’ that a spider builds. some species of spiders build complex silk baskets for their eggs. The basket consists of a ‘floor’ and a domed roof, complete with an escape hole for the hatchlings. They are very complex and very impressive without a doubt, but the spider makes them according to an inbuilt program. If that program is disrupted or indeed can not be initiated the spider simply can not cope. If a spider is disturbed just after it has constructed the floor of the basket it can’t simply start again. It has to complete the program cycle. It will spin the domed roof, then lay the eggs in there, and because there is no floor the eggs fall onto the ground an all die. \n\nCan you imagine a bird or squirrel that is disturbed hen it begins making its nest trying to build the sides of the nest on nothing? Nope, that’s because mammals and birds are flexible. The basic of nest building may be inbuilt, but the specifics are the result of learning and adaptations. \n\nAnd that is true of all invertebrate behaviour. An caterpillar will starve to death in a room full of food simply because the food doesn’t have any smell, or a spider that is prevented form spinning a web will starve even when given unlimited amounts of disabled but living insects because it can ONLY hunt when food is caught in a web. Bees will fight to the death to keep other insects out of their hive, but once they are inside the hive and acquire the right smell they will let other insects kill them and take no action at all.\n\nAnd the list of examples goes on and on. Bugs simply are not very adaptable creatures. If they experience something new they simply can not do anything about it at all. And although spiders, ants and so forth can learn their ability is extremely limited. They can exhibit complex behaviour in one limited way, but they can’t readily alter that behaviour. \n\nAnd that is why they can exhibit apparently complex behaviour with a small brain. The complexity is wired in, with no ‘waste’ space. But that comes at the expense of adaptability. In contrast mammals exhibit les complex behaviours but are infinitely more adaptable. Horses for courses.",1603

6,"What does someone who studied Medical Assisting do? ; Also...what's the salary range? What kind of jobs can the person apply to? ; Medical assistants perform routine administrative and clinical tasks to keep the offices and clinics of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors and optometrists running smoothly. \n\nThe duties of medical assistants vary from office to office, depending on the location and size of the practice and the practitioner's specialty. In small practices, medical assistants usually are ""generalists,"" handling both administrative and clinical duties and reporting directly to an office manager, physician or other health practitioner. Those in large practices tend to specialize in a particular area, under the supervision of department administrators.\n\nMedical assistants perform many administrative duties, including answering telephones, greeting patients, updating and filing patients' medical records, filling out insurance forms, handling correspondence, scheduling appointments, arranging for hospital admission and laboratory services, and handling billing and bookkeeping.\n\nClinical duties vary according to state law and include taking medical histories and recording vital signs, explaining treatment procedures to patients, preparing patients for examination, and assisting the physician during the examination. Medical assistants collect and prepare laboratory specimens or perform basic laboratory tests on the premises, dispose of contaminated supplies, and sterilize medical instruments. They instruct patients about medications and special diets, prepare and administer medications as directed by a physician, authorize drug refills as directed, telephone prescriptions to a pharmacy, draw blood, prepare patients for X- rays, take electrocardiograms, remove sutures, and change dressings.\n\nMedical assistants also may arrange examining-room instruments and equipment, purchase and maintain supplies and equipment, and keep waiting and examining rooms neat and clean.\n\nAssistants who specialize have additional duties. Podiatric medical assistants make castings of feet, expose and develop X-rays, and assist podiatrists in surgery. Ophthalmic medical assistants help ophthalmologists provide eye care. They conduct diagnostic tests, measure and record vision, and test eye muscle function. They also show patients how to insert, remove and care for contact lenses, and they apply eye dressings. Under the direction of the physician, ophthalmic medical assistants may administer eye medications. They also maintain optical and surgical instruments and may assist the ophthalmologist in surgery.\n\nThe earnings of medical assistants vary, depending on their experience, skill level and location. Median annual earnings of medical assistants were $23,940 in 2002. The middle 50 percent earned between $20,260 and $28,410. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $17,640, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $34,130. Median annual earnings in the industries employing the largest numbers of medical assistants in 2002 were as follows:\n\nGeneral medical and surgical hospitals: $24,460 \nOffices of physicians: $24,260 \nOutpatient care centers: $23,980 \nOther ambulatory healthcare services: $23,440 \nOffices of other health practitioners: $21,620",1623

Sacramento Dweller was correct in identifying this seemingly awkward grammatical structure as a matter of tense.  Sentences utilizing this particular structure generally fall under the category of ""Conditional Sentences.""  Sentences featuring the 'had had' syntax are classified as ""The Third Conditional,"" or ""Conditional Type Three,"" and can generally be diagnosed by analyzing them for similarities with following structural formulae:\n\n(The Type 3 Conditional / Third Conditional Formula:)\n\n"" IF + <insert past perfect tense verb> + <insert perfect conditional tense verb> = RESULT OF SUPPOSED CONDITIONS.*\n\n*~NOTE:  RESULT(S) of the supposed conditions usually resemble one of the following two structures, depending on when events occurred:  \n\n(1.) Result:  <insert simple present or past tense verb to express an obvious, or predictable fact / outcome>\n\n(2.) Result:  <insert modal verb  + simple present or past tense verb to express a known fact / outcome >\n\nEXAMPLE #1:  ""If you had had proper training as an assassin, we would not be in this situation...""\n\nEXAMPLE #2:  ""If I'd had proper training as an assassin, you probably wouldn't be here to complain.""\n\n(Notice how in EXAMPLE #2, the contractions 'I'd' is used instead of saying, 'I had had' to illustrate the terms of the condition being discussed, though still allowing the reader to ascertain and understand the time-frame and sequence in which events occcurred?)\n\nRules for proper usage of the ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure state that the structures are 'to be used when talking about unreal, or ""hypothetical"" situations occurring in the past.'  That means, the related events DID NOT 'ACTUALLY' HAPPEN in the past.  Sentences utilizing this structure are almost always phrased to reckon, ""If circumstances were different, what could / would have this been like?""  \n\nThe expression of time / tense in this [third] variety of conditional sentence structure IS identified as the past, and indicates that an action was completed ""in"" the past.  The condition and / or result, therefore, cannot logically be fulfilled because the action in the ""IF"" clause never actually happened.  Action in ""Third Conditional / Conditional Type 3"" sentence structure is almost ALWAYS characterized by the quality of being absurd, and impossible to achieve.\n\nTense and Terminology?\n\n-Simple Present Tense:  Expresses a fact, habit/routine, or ability.\n\n-Simple Past:  Implies that the action happened before and is not happening anymore.\n\n-Past Perfect (Pluperfect) Tense:  Relates that an action or event ended prior to another action or event.\n\n-Present Perfect (Continuous) [Past-composite] Tense:  Indicates either events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Perfect (Conditional) Tense: Relates varying degrees of certianty or uncertainty about events in recent past, or events which occurred in the past at an unknown time.\n\n-Modal Verbs:  incorporated with other verbs to illustrate the notion of possibility, impossability, necessity or other degree of probability.",1634

2,"Can I get pregnant after I get off the pill? ; I want to go on birth control pill for contraceptive reasons. But I was on it before (for acne) and it made me really emotional so I got off and I felt better, but after I got off I didn't have my period for 7 months! I want to have babies in about 3 or 4 years, will going on the pill make that chance less? Also, is it better to just stay on or go on and off of the pill? My fiance is in the military so I don't see him that often but when we do well, you know what happens ^_~ Also, what are other side effects of the pill? do different ones do different things? I don't want to gain weight, be emotionally unstable or get acne. ; 1.) Yes, you can get pregnant after coming off the pill. For some women it takes a while for their cycle to return to normal. For some it only takes a few weeks or a month. Talk with your gynecologist to decide what pill will be best for you. \n2.) Remember when starting a new pill side effects can last anywhere from a week to three months so give it a fair go. It is better to just stay on it straight through versus going on and off. Going on and off can seriously whack your body/cycle and emotions out because your body will be constantly having a change in the hormones. And your periods would be all over the place.\n3.) Every pill will affect different people differently. That's why I say check with your doctor. I DON'T recommend the shot(Depo Provera) because some of the more common side effects are constant spotting and weight gain. Also it can take months or even a year after you go off it to have a regular cycle back. You may want to try a low-dose pill because of previous emotional side effects. Something like Ortho TriCyclen Lo or that new Nuvaring(you only have to remember that once a month!).\n\nGood luck.",1671

So if a person wants to go to church, claim Christ as their savior, pray and then turn around and kill somebody, then they just have that choice, God didn't create robots.  You cant associate the personal choices of people with those of all christians.  That's just like saying because a white guy with a beard robbed you, then all white guys with beards are theives. If some christians judge or do wrong, then they'll have to deal with God themselves, but for a person to use that as an excuse to reject christianity is stupid.

Sun and Moon were created in Genesis 1:14-16? ; Genesis 1\n 1In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. \n 2And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. \n 3And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. \n 4And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. \n 5And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day....................................................... \n 14And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: \n 15And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. \n 16And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. \n SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE??? ; It seems that the earth had been established in orbit around the sun and was a globe covered with water before the six “days,” or periods, of special creative works began. “There was darkness upon the surface of the watery deep.” (Genesis 1:2) At that early point, something—perhaps a mixture of water vapor, other gases, and volcanic dust—must have prevented sunlight from reaching the surface of the earth. The Bible describes the first creative period this way: “God proceeded to say, ‘Let there be light’; and gradually light came into existence,” or reached the surface of the earth.—Genesis 1:3,\n\nThe expression “gradually . . . came” accurately reflects a form of the Hebrew verb involved, denoting a progressive action that takes time to complete. Anyone who reads the Hebrew language can find this form some 40 times in Genesis chapter 1, and it is a key to understanding the chapter. What God began in the figurative evening of a creative period, or age, became progressively clear, or apparent, after the morning of that “day.” Also, what was started in one period did not have to be fully completed when the next period began. To illustrate, light gradually began to appear on the first “day,” yet it was not until the fourth creative period that the sun, moon, and stars could have been discerned.\n\nThe Bible does not specify the length of each of the creative periods. Yet all six of them have ended, it being said with respect to the sixth day (as in the case of each of the preceding five days): “And there came to be evening and there came to be morning, a sixth day.” (Ge 1:31) However, this statement is not made regarding the seventh day, on which God proceeded to rest, indicating that it continued. (Ge 2:1-3) Also, more than 4,000 years after the seventh day, or God’s rest day, commenced, Paul indicated that it was still in progress. At Hebrews 4:1-11\n\nThe first day did not complete the “creation” of light with respect to the earth. The sources of it, of course, existed before that first day but were invisible from the surface of the earth. (Genesis 1:1) The first day saw only the penetration of diffused light to the surface of the earth, made possible by the thinning of obscuring layers that enveloped the earth like ‘swaddling bands.’ (Job 38:9) Illumination at the surface gradually increased with the thinning of the interfering layers.",1728

Rather, they arbitrarily 'save themselves' through a false hope that all they need is 'faith'.\n But as I have observed time and again on this forum, their is little to no substance to the claims of salvation.\nIf one expects to receive the blessings of everlasting life, but disregards the effort of studying the word of god to find out what is acceptable to him, than, it is ludicrous to think that god will just somehow toss aside his own requirements to accommodate all the lazy people with their unrealistic expectations.\nThe simple truth? denominations are proof of deceitful men drawing men to follow themselves, thus putting a stumbling block in the path of weak minded persons to full of apathy as regards their own wish for eternal life.",1802

1,"is oxygen flammable? ; will oxygen burn by itself without a fuel source? ; The answer is resoundingly NO.   Oxygen is NOT a fuel.

If it did, our atmosphere (which is 20.9% oxygen) would have burned up a long time ago.\n\nOxygen is mixed with a number of different fuel sources to get a faster, hotter burn.  Acetylene, used in metal cutting torches, is mixed with oxygen to get a super hot flame that will quickly cut through metal.\n\nNASA uses oxygen to burn hydrogen fuel, not only to get a fast burn required in a rocket engine, but also because surrounding oxygen in the atmosphere becomes much more scarce as you leave the atmosphere for space.",1911

The fossils are in chronological order: single-celled, multi-celled, soft-bodied, fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, apes ...\n\nIf creationism did happen, wouldn't the fossils appear simultaneously? Side by side?\n\nIf the Great Flood did happen, shouldn't the fish be on the top layer instead of near the bottom? Since fish would've survived in the ocean during the Great Flood ...?\n\nNo, ""devil created fossils"" or ""it was God's magic"" answers. Logical answers only please. ; You are right.\n\nCenturion: I hope that you only are asking this question sarcastically, in order to give an example of the silly questions that creationists ask, so nobody has to explain that obviously species take separate evolutionary paths, based on their environment, so that the same species in different environments will eventually evolve into different species.\n\nUnknown: What do you mean by a fossil of a creature turning into something else?  That doesn't really make much sense, seeing how all creatures are in the process of turning into ""something else"" - we just don't know what the future of evolution holds.  Haven't you heard about the recent discovery of the fossil of the ""fish"" which helps to provide evidence of the transition of animals from water to land?  I don't really know what you mean by saying that there are no ""missing links"" - there are thousands of them!  I just ahve the feeling that no number of missing links would be sufficient.  Between any two species it will always be possible ask for a ""linking"" fossil, and since there cannot be an infinite number of fossils, it will always be theoretically possible to say that no missing links have been found.\n\nmamcrackin: http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=12200044CLXE\nsee my comment above that no number of misssing links will ever be able to ""prove"" evolution.  If half-man/half-animal were found (and they have been, just look at all the fossils of the earlier human species) creationists would just ask for 3/4 man, 1/4 animal fossils, and then 7/8 man, 1/8 animal, and so on.  \n\nindiebaptist: Her point is that while there would be fish fossils evenly dispersed throughout the layers of earth, non-aquatic animals would be clumped in one layer - the layer during which the flood occurred.  This is not what we find when looking at the fossils in the layers of earth.  The great flood was also gods way of killing a lot of animals who had done nothing to deserve that punishment. by the way, hovind's PhD (from a non accredited school) is in christian education, not biology or any other science. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind  \nI really have to wonder where you are getting your facts from.

1,"At an engineering institution, when students don't like their major, what do they usually change it to? ; I guess I'm asking, what is everyone's second choice at an engineering institution? ; Most women I know who enter engineering (few though they may be) change to Mathematics after the first year or so. \n\nI know a few guys who went in to PoliSci and are having fun with that. My university is big on engineering, compsci, and premed, so I see lots of changes of major -- and polisci pops up quite often for people from all three schools. \n\nI personally was a Computer Engineering major, but ended up going ICS and Anthro after about a year and a half of boredom (considerably more EE stuff than I was expecting, and not enough programming).\n\nPhysics is also a popular transfer. Usually people go for whatever they found interesting while they were in engineering. I took a breadth anthro class that I really enjoyed and I also did a great deal of programming in my free time, so I capitalized on those interests and pursued both majors. That was almost two years ago, and now I'm wrapping up anthro this quarter and will probably graduate in just under two years from now with a pair of full majors (a bs and a ba). So if you have multiple interests, don't be afraid to go for multiple majors or minors -- they add on college time (and $$$) but you won't have any regrets. And majors can easily become minors if you lose interest in them along the way, or decide you want to graduate sooner. \n\nUltimately the decision is always a personal one.",2022

Belief is defined as a conviction of the truth of a proposition without its verification. Agnosticism does not violate this, and this definition of theism does not violate agnosticism.\n\nThey can act upon their belief as though it is true but again, without verification.  They believe while admitting that it cannot be absolutely PROVEN that what they believe in is true.  Hey, I never said it was logical.\n\nBelief: to have confidence in the truth, the existence, or the reliability of something, although without absolute proof that one is right in doing so.  I pulled that directly from the dictionary.  So you're right in that they might as well be called theists since theists would possess the same belief... but to get unnecessarily technical, most theists would insist that they DO have ""absolute proof"", so those who admit to being without ""absolute proof"" or at least incapable of attaining such would be ""agnostic"" in that regard.",2096

The Smiths were concerned about exploitation but after reading the novel on which the film was based agreed to allow their son to audition.

Because of his illness, Smith is just over three feet tall, having undergone several operations including a spinal fusion and two bilateral osteotomies, he was the perfect choice to play Simon, touted as having been so small when he was born his mother didn't even notice the delivery.

As well as the appropriate wood for an arrow. ; Hard question to answer, bud.  A simple survival bow is easy enough but I have no idea how much work you want to put into it.\n\nEasiest way to learn?  Find a good sapling approx 3-4"" in diam that's scrub.  Lop it off approx a foot above the ground and cut it so it's approx 6' long.  Lots of really good woods out there and most everyone has their fav....me I just say cut a sapling.\n\nUse a semisharp knife and a hammer and split it right down the middle from the thin end.  Do that again so you have a 1/4 trunk.  That's called a bowstave.\n\nRound off the sharpness on that triangle shape in the exact middle, but keep the triangle shape.  Starting about a foot on either side of the center point, start whittling the triangle flatter and flatter as you move out to the ends.  Always whittle the back, not the front!\n\nKeep experimenting with bending it as you whittle....so if one end bends more than the other, simply whittle a bit more on the other end til it bends approx the same.  That's called ""tillering"".  I won't get into it.\n\nOnce both ends (the limbs) bend in a good solid arc and it feels good to you, carefully notch the ends so they can hold a string.\n\nTie your string on one end and then keep bending the bow and retying the other til the tight string is approx 8"" from the back of the bow.\n\nThat's a really basic survival type bow.  You could spend years mastering each step if you wanted to really make bows, but that one will have you shooting within an hour or two and they're fun to teach the kids as a summer project.\n\nArrows....you can use the same old 1/4 trunks that you cut for the bow.  Each one will make approx four arrows.  Simply split each 1/4 stave like before and just start whittling the corners.  Keep whittling the corners until they're round.\n\nAnything I need to cover in more depth?",2482

Thanks if you can make me smarter with this bit of info :) ; C. \n\nTechnically the answer could be argued for either, so if you picked A, and it's wrong, but can give a good argument, then you may get credit for it.  A good argument would say ""The people of the nation elect a president because it is their votes that make the decision on who the state casts a vote for.  The people are a necessary part of the process of the way the electoral college is executed - de facto vs. de jure.""\n\nIf the answer is A and you picked C, then I would argue the following.

Taking into account metathesis, we can find cognates of the word Earth in the Latin terra and in the modern Romance Languages (i.e. tierra in Spanish).\n\nAlthough a link to such Indo-European languages has not been proved, several Semitic languages have similar-sounding words for Earth: aard in Arabic, irtsitu in Assyrian, araa in Aramaic, erets in Phoenician (which appears in the Mesha Stele), and ארץ (arets, or erets when followed by a noun modifier) in Hebrew.""\n\nThe fact that Earth and not Water was used seems intuitive.

1,"Will we ever be able to go F.T.L.? ; i know there are a lot of doubts about this because the energy required would be close to infinite, and opening up a wormhole would also be next to impossible, even in the next 200 years of scientific advancement.  But, are there any scientific optimist out there who truly believes that we'll be able to achieve FTL in the next century or so, and why?  Give some minor facts to back up your claim. ; There is a big difference between predictions that the speed of sound could not be broken and that the speed of light cannot. It was always known that *some* things can go faster than sound. Bullets for example. The question was whether we would have the technology to get people to that speed.\n\nThe speed of light is very different since we haven't seen *anything* go faster than light in a vacuum. Nothing. Ever. Furthermore, the predictions of special relativity have been verified in particle accelerators when the particles are going to within a hundred thousandth of the speed of light.\n\nAs an example, at Fermilab protons are accelerated to energies of 2TeV. This is over 2000 times the rest mass of those protons. To accelerate something the mass of a *gram* to an equivalent speed would take about the energy of the largest hydrogen bomb ever exploded. This amount of energy would be needed for each gram to get to that speed, so multiply it by 75000 for a medium sized human. And that doesn't count the spaceship they would have to travel in!\n\nNow, this is how much energy is needed to get to speed we *know* about. To go faster would require even more. Unfortunately, we have never seen a wormhole of any type. But the predictions are that the energy requirements would be even more prohibitive than what I just described.",2622
1,"What is the easiest way to make an electromagnet? ; I am trying to build an electromagnet that can hold 200 to 500 lbs. ; Well, the easiest way is to get some wire, wrap it around a iron/steel rod, and apply a current to the wire.\n\nTo get an electromagnet to have a lifting capacity that you specified, it will require a little more engineering work.  Trying to stay in the most basic terms, the power of your magnet will depend on how much current you put through the wire, how many turns you have around the iron rod, and something called the magnetic permeability of the iron rod.  Now there's some trade-offs with all of these factors.  More turns increases the magnet flux (strength), but requires more wire and increases the resistance.  More resistance means that you will need more current to counteract this problem.  Treating your electromagnet strictly as a resistor (which it is not), by following Ohm's law, you increase the current by increasing the voltage.   Too much current and you may end up melting your wire.   You want to keep the wire as small as possible so that you can get the turns as close as possible to your iron rod, but smaller wire has a higher resistance and lower current carrying capability.\n\nIt's a matter of balancing a lot of equations to get the best combination.  Your best bet is a little trial and error.",2628

1,"Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ; Which of the following best describes why the smaller terrestrial worlds have cooler interiors than the larger ones? \n\na)They had more volcanic eruptions in the past, which released their internal heat. \nb)They were cooler when they formed. \nc)They have relatively fewer radioactive elements. \nd)The smaller ones are farther from the Sun. \ne)They have relatively more surface area compared to their volumes. ; Of your choices, (e) is the best.  (a) is no good because it fails to account for the continuing generation of heat, as, for example, by the earth.  (b) is no good because they were all about the same temperature when they formed.  As the protoplanets grew larger, their interiors began to heat up.  (c) is no good because what matters more is density, and there's no reason to believe there are significant differences in the density of radioactive elements.  (d) is just plain false: Earth is farther from the sun than Mercury.\n\nThat leaves (e).  Surface area of a sphere is 4pr^2, where p is pi, and volume is (4/3) pr^3, so the ratio of surface area to volume varies as 1/r ... it varies inversely with radius, so the ratio for smaller planets is greater than that for larger ones.\n\nThe key connection, though, is internal <pressure>, which is a direct function of r.  Larger planets have more pressure at their centers, and that means more heat.  In fact, if the ""planet"" were big enough, it would become a star.\n\nConclusion:  Big means hot.",2680

6,"Financial institution or not?  When to dump? ; I've been managing my money for quite some time and have done very well.  I realized that I may not be making wise choices with mutual funds and gave $80K to Fidelity to manage while I manage the rest of my accounts with Fidelity.  This was 4 months ago.  My rollover has since lost 10k.  Is it time to dump or is this the stock market?  None of my other investments have lost this much.  This is 10 grand in 4 months...   I'm ready to call them and say ""we're done, I'll do it"" but I'm not sure if they've changed my funds to give me a better turnover whereas I've left my money in my other funds for years.  Am I missing something? ; With respect to the market in general, there's been a good-sized pullback from May to the current period.  Those stocks which have suffered most are the ones which have had the largest amount of growth (precious metals, emerging markets, etc.).  Many funds not only lost all of their gains Jan-Apr, but many actually dipped into negative YTD territory.\n\nSo you have to ask yourself: is this money you have in Fidelity on a permanent downward trend or an overdue correction?  Are your losses due to the possibility that your investments at Fidelity were focused on the highest growth (and therefore most volatile and overdue for correction) funds?  What are the long-term performance records of the funds you've chosen (4 months is a drop in the bucket of time)?\n\nBasically, you can't just look at gains and losses.  You have to look specifically at the funds you've chosen, and balance them against your personal risk tolerance.  It's very likely that with the right (or wrong) combination of funds, you could have lost as much with T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Bridgeway or any number of fund families.  If you don't believe me, look at their Websites and check the fund performances.  Red ink all over the place.\n\nDon't dump funds just because they're going down or buy them just because they're going up.  How do you know you're not buying at the top or selling at the bottom?  You'll inevitably wind up buying high and selling low.  Understand why you're buying into a fund and if the circumstances that made you buy them still make sense, stick with them.  If circumstances have changed, that's the time to re-evaluate and think about selling.  Also think about selling if the assumptions you made originally were wrong.",2688

4,"When I reboot PC, the boot up sequence will not complete? ; My HP Vectra v l400 PC (P III 667 MHz) running on XP keeps on showing the ""shutting down"" dialogue box. When I reboot PC, the boot up sequence will not complete. It keeps auto rebooting, shutting down, initialising then shutdown again by itself. I tried formatting the hard disk but then it cannot complete reading the whole recovery disk since while reading, it automatically shuts down and restarts without completing the whole boot-up sequence. I also tried reloading original configuration in the set-up mode but to no avail. No error would appear whatsoever, a clicking sound is heard to suggest that the computer has been powered-on then shutdown (no power) and then clicking sound to suggest it is again powering up. Sometimes if lucky enough, longer powering up even reaches to display the start-up screen but sometimes is too short that clicks on and off in short durations. This is like booting and rebooting done automatically by the computer. Is this a case of hardware problem and part has most probably been damaged? This is perfectly working before but not until now no new software/hardware was installed whatsoever. Please advise. ; There could be several reasons for this problem. First it appears that there is some program installed on your system, which loads at the time to booting up of your system causing the system to crash. The best solution is to start the computer in the last known good configuration and let the PC restore it to previous best state. However, if by any reason, it is not solving the problem, try starting the system in safe mode. You can do this by hitting F8 key as soon as Windows stops checking memory and immediately before the Windows is loaded. It will give you the options mentioned above. After logging on successfully, you can edit Msconfig file to disable the trouble creating program. The second reason could be a boot sector virus, which is causing this problem. You can also try to boot using a fresh bootable disk and check the system for viruses. Third, this could also be due to the presence of bad sector on your system. You can check out for Bad sectors, in the error checking option under tools menu of properties Window of the drive. If there are bad sectors on your hard disk, then you can blame this problem on bad sectors (hardware problem) and would need to low-level format your hard disk to wipe off the bad sectors.",2780

Drugs & Criminals use the border like a revolving door ; I wish I had an answer for you.  This is a sore subject with me.  You forgot to mention that not only are out schools overcrowded but they are also doing bi-lingual teaching which, if memory serves me correctly, is illegal in CA, and it hinders the learning process for the children who are english speaking only.  How do I know this?  Because my child went to a school where literally most of the teachers only taught in spanish and neglected the english only speaking students and my childs grades and learning abilities went into the toilet along with friends.  I quickly yanked my kid out of that particular school, went into another school district where  the non-english speaking children were taught in a different class for a certain amount of time during the school day so the other children were not distracted by the different language and they did not suffer in their studies.   Oh and let's not forget that it seems like all the stores now have all their signs posted in spanish first and english second, if we are lucky.\n\nOur country seems to do so much for the illegal aliens yet don't do jack crap for the citizens who were either born and raised here or who came to the country legally.\n\nLike I said, it is a sore subject with me so I guess it's time to get off my soapbox.\n\nps:  I highly doubt that California would be crippled economically if there were not illegal immigrant workers (illegal aliens).

History of stereotypes, (i.e. brought about by slavery, immigration, etc.....)\n   c. How are stereotypes formed.\n\nII. Impact of stereotyping in the workplace.\n    a.Racial/ethnic groups targeted by   stereotypes. (Here, discuss the impact of stereotyping, and institutional racism of African Americans, Latinos, and other ethnic groups that are growing in population in America.\n    b.Discuss diversity initiatives developed by employers to combat stereotypes.\n    c. Melting Pot vs. Salad Bowl. Here discuss that modern day sociologists no longer use the ""Melting Pot"" to describe America. We use the Salad Bowl. A ""Melting Pot"" was found not to appreciate individual differences. We are all put in a big pot and mixed all together. We are taught that we have to be the same. With the ""Salad Bowl,"" you have your lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, etc.... We are individual culturally, yet we can come together as one, and our individual differences are still accepted.\n\nIII. What is Tolerance?\n     a. Give definition of tolerance. Go to www.dictionary.com to get all of your definitions okay?\n     b. Is tolerance fair? State that it is not. Tolerate means to put up with? Do we really want to ""put up"" those Mexicans, or those Pakistani people? No! We want to be appreciative and accepting of their culture, their contributions to the changing color of America. Get the point? \n\nIV. Summary/Questions:\n     a. Do a wrap up of your presentation, and give your audience time to ask questions: Also, have a list of books ready for reference. Perhaps you could pass out a reference sheet. A great book is ""It's the Little Things. Everyday interactions, that annoy, anger and divide the races."" I suggest that you read this book.

2,"how can gain 15 pounds healthy? ; i play handball almost everyday but the thing i cant stop playin handball because i am in a handball team in school... so how can i gain 15 pounds with out just eating a lot of junk food ; HOW TO GAIN WEIGHT HEALTHFULLY \n\n1. Eat consistently. Every day, have three hearty meals plus one to three additional snacks. Do NOT skip meals! You'll miss out on important calories that you need to accomplish your goals.\n\n2. Eat larger than normal portions. Instead of having one sandwich for lunch, have two. Eat three potatoes at dinner, instead of only two. Have a taller glass of milk, bigger bowl of cereal, larger piece of fruit. \n\n3. Select higher calorie foods. Read food labels to determine which foods have more calories than an equally enjoyable counterpart. \n\n4. Drink lots of juice and milk. Beverages are a simple way to increase your caloric intake, quench your thirst with calorie.\nHowever, remember that drinking water is important too as it gives you the energy to gain weight.\n\n 5. Do strengthening exercises (weight lifting, push-ups) to stimulate muscular development so that you bulk-up instead of fatten up. Some underweight people are afraid exercise will result in weight loss rather than weight gain. If that is your case, remember that exercise tends to stimulate the appetite; you will want to eat more. (Yes, exercise may temporarily ""kill"" your appetite right after a hard workout, but within a few hours, you will get hungry.) Exercise also increases thirst; you will easily be able to drink extra juices.\n\n\n6. (extremely important!)  Stay away from bad fat! Even though weight gain is your goal, you do not want to be gaining fat and eating junk. Get rid of the chips and candy. No more fast food, nothing fried. Stick to high protein, low (saturated) fat foods like tuna fish (and other seafood), chicken breast, turkey,  rice, pasta, fruits and vegetables, nuts.\n\nGOOD LUCK\nHaya",2798

There was nothing I wouldn't do for her (within reason), and she did stuff for me, just not as much. She invited me to hang out with her and do stuff all the time, and she was a good best friend. I found out that she had been poisoning others against me behind my back, she was never fond of me to begin with, was annoyed when I called her my best friend, and she was using me. I'd like to forgive her, but I don't know how to forgive treachery.\n\nThe other demon is my dad's g/f. She is THE MOST SELFISH person I have EVER met! She expects things to be done all for her or her way, and never lets my dad or ANYBODY else have their say. She doesn't do anything for herself, her daddy does everything for her and lives across the street from her, she's VERY wasteful, and... ; I don't know if you're a religious person, but since your question is about forgiveness, I'll answer it from a Christian perspective; but please understand that you don't have to be religious in order to benefit from the wisdom of the Bible.  I do not consider myself to be Christian, but I still use many things I read in the Bible to help me through challenges of the spirit such as the one you have describe.\n\nFirst of all, we should ALWAYS forgive others.  Jesus said to forgive people seventy times seven times, which comes out to be 490 times.  If you have to forgive someone more times than that, they are probably so evil that it's not going to matter whether you forgive them or not; at that point your best best would bwe to just get the hell away from them!  LOL\n\nBut I think what he meant was to forgive as much as you possibly can.  But you sound very young to me- it sounds like there's not a whole lot you can do OTHER than forgive; sadly, we are basically powerless in our youth to change the behavior of others, so you'd better forgive wholeheartedly and do it RIGHT.  The following information is lengthy, but it will help you learn all you need to know about forgiveneness:\n\n- This is not an optional action on our part, but rather it is imperative to our own well being that we forgive others.\n- Most Christians understand that this is not always an easy task.\n- For some, there have been people in their lives which have wronged them severly.\n\n- Though it may be a process, and it may not happen instantaneously, we must be willing to take the first steps toward forgiving others.\n- As long as we continue to harbor bitterness in our hearts toward someone else, we allow that individual to have a controlling factor in our lives.\n- There are a number of occasions where unforgiving Christians lose their relationship with God because of what someone else had done to them in the church.\n\n- There was once a man who lost his relationship not only with God, but also his children and people in the church because of his bitterness toward others. He basically went around feeling sorry for himself all the time.\n- To forgive means to ""send away"". In other words, to not hang on to the wrong doing.\n\n- When you forgive someone, it means that you are not holding that sin against that person.\n- Therefore, you're not focused on how you can get back at that person.\n- You're not praying that their boat will sink or that their plane will crash.\n- As a matter of fact, you actually begin to pray for their salvation and deliverance.\n\n- Understand that when you forgive someone, it doesn't mean that you have to re-establish a relationship with that person.\n- It may, by God's will, lead to that and that's great if that's what God desires.\n- In the verse, there's no mention that you should stop praying and go find that person to let them know that you forgive them.\n- Release the thought of anger and bitterness and hurt unto God.\n\n- Forgiveness does not mean, by the way, to forget.\n- Trying to forget is merely an attempt to hide something.\n- When you hide something, someone will eventually find it.\n- We're are to deal with he hurt and send it away.\n\n- Jesus didn't just preach this. He lived this.\n\n(Luke 23:33-34 NKJV) And when they had come to the place called Calvary, there they crucified Him, and the criminals, one on the right hand and the other on the left.Then Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do."" And they divided His garments and cast lots.\n\nFORGIVING OTHERS HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND AND RECEIVE FORGIVENESS\n\n(Mat 6:14-15 NKJV) ""For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.""\n\n- It seems as if God's ability to forgive us is contingent upon our ability to forgi",2837

4,"what are 3G network standards ? ; I need to study many details regarding 3G network:\n- Bandwidth\n- Power Consumption\n- constrains ; Third Generation (3G) is the latest technology for mobile devices and services. 3G is touted to be the next major technology in the mobile industry to stimulate growth and change the way we all do business.\nWhat does 3G provide? The drivers toward 3G wireless technology are its significantly increased data speeds (up to 2 Mbps) and a whole range of multimedia services such as access to corporate LANs, video conferencing, location tracking, sending/receiving email, and surfing the Internet to name a few. The move to 3G has been slowed by the recent three year downturn in the telecom industry, but many wireless providers have already begun to make the change. Since this transition is unavoidable, those service providers which are first to offer these advanced multimedia services will be among the leaders to realize the significant economic rewards\n\nAccording to market analyst Yankee Group, European carriers are expected to spend approximately $274 billion ($US) to upgrade their networks for 3G services. In the United States it is expected that 2.5G and 3G upgrade expenditures may exceed $100 Billion and in Asia, $50 Billion\n3G technologies use higher frequencies for base station-to-handset connectivity than 2G networks. Consequently, each 3G base station has a much shorter range and smaller associated coverage area. It is generally agreed that 3G networks require four to five times as many base stations to obtain the same coverage as 2G networks. Also, because of more advanced services and even greater number of subscribers and higher average data rates, even more base stations are needed to cover the same geographical area\n\n3G network architecture is very similar to that of 2G networks, except for a few new network elements in the core network to accommodate the packet data. In 3G networks, the Radio Access Network portion incorporates a new base station component called Node B that performs the same function that the Base Station Transceiver (BTS) does in 2G. Also, the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in 3G networks replaces the 2G Base Station Controller (BSC). The traffic from the BTS to the BSC in 2.x generation networks is typically carried over TDM-based circuits. With 3G networks, the traffic from the Node B to RNCs is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based or Internet Protocol (IP)-based. For both 2.xG and 3G, these backhaul circuits are either T1/E1 or equivalent IP connections.\nEarly 3G implementations co-located 3G Node Bs with 2G base stations (BTS) at the same cell site location. In some cases, there may also be the BTS from the 1G (analog) network at this site. This may result in three distinct and separate backhaul networks to carry traffic from each generation of the network. For example, Cingular is operating an overlay of AMPs (Advance Mobile Phone Service), TDMA, and GSM. Eliminating the overlay presents mobile operators with cost-saving opportunities.\n\nSince the new wireless standards are packet based, user data traffic is not always constant. This “bursty data” results in T1 or E1 backhaul circuits from the base stations that are only moderately utilized. Since the TDM-based backhaul circuits for both 1G and 2.xG networks lack the “optimized” multiplexing capabilities inherent in data networks, a better solution is to use ATM or IP for backhaul. This allows ability to over-subscribe as these interfaces can efficiently handle the bursts of data traffic.\n\nWith the worldwide mobile subscriber base growing and the use of bandwidth intensive data applications increasing, more and more T1 and E1 circuits will be required to backhaul traffic from these 3G base station upgrades. A large number of lightly loaded T1 or E1 backhaul circuits are not only cost-prohibitive, but also consume an enormous number of ports on the BSC or RNC. These ports are very expensive and require large amounts of physical space at the Mobile Switching Office (MSO). Therefore, aggregating these backhaul circuits into highe",2993

1,"What are the winds that most \naffect ocean currents? ; plz someone help ; Ocean currents are the funamental transfer of heat from warm areas to cold areas. They have the potential to affect the jet streams and general pressure patterns around the globe. Ocean currents still remain in many areas despite daily flouctuating changes in surface air conditions.\n\nIn order to find the answer to this you have to see where sea currents are the most weak and where air currents are present. I would therefore suggest that the doldrums are probably the most likely to affect sea currents, as well as extreme winds such as hurricans, monsoons and also some deep low pressures in the North atlantic Ocean.",3038

Their own military forces are steadily taking over the responsibility of policing and defending their own nations.\n\nRead the following letter from Al-Zarkawi.  He says the U.S. is beating the crap out of his terrorist group, and that Al-Qaeda is being suffocated.  Al-Zarkawi himself says that the U.S. can only lose the battle in Iraq by listening to the unrelenting pessism of the liberal press.  Our commanders, AND Al-Qaeda say the U.S. can't lose militarily.

Only the reincarnation could to explain us why some people have more things than other, or better life and resources than other without thinking in material things, resources in different leves, emotional, spiritualy, etc. ; There are two possibilities.\n\n1. The reincarnation is a fact because nobody, any pastor, any catholic roman father or anybody can explain why there are so strong differences between the human beings.\n\nWe are living always in a process to have the perfection in our soul, and our soul need live many experiences because through our experiences we can learn. And one life is so short for it. We must have other chances to take good choices. Definetly, the reincarnation is VERY AND A HALF POSSIBLE, but the question is...Why Jesus did not tell us about it? MAy be we was not ready to know something like that? MAy be soon the true will be discovered.\n\n2. The other option is that we only have one life. and this life happens because there are a big Machine of souls that is sending us here to have experiences like humans giving us the chance to go to the Heaven forever or to the Hell. and this chance is for us but the world was gave to the humans like God says in Genesis. And we are the resposible about what will happen with our brothers when are borning here and are sick or poor or something.

This kid is already on record as the youngest QB ever to win a Superbowl, he's got his whole life and career in front of him, and he doesn't care to protect all that he has to live for?\n\nOne article I read mentions how players past and present, as well as his coach have appealed to him to reconsider his celebration of freedom in not having to wear a helmet. Fellow Americans presumably equally in support of ""freedom"" yet were also able to consider what he potentially had to lose if he should meet in an accident.\n\nAnd here we are. The article I read said ""injuries do not appear life-threatening."" Will he play again? Sheesh, we are not out of the woods of whether he'll have a sound mind again, let alone make critical decisions with a blitzing linebacker zeroing in on him.\n\nAs a fan, this player attitude has always bugged me. The discussion issue to which I'm referring is whether athletes, paid by fans, should have some obligation to the fans. Ticket prices go up when big name players are signed, and if they are injured - especially preventable injuries - why shouldn't ticket prices go down and let insurance pay their salary, or refuse it if they insist on taking unnecessary risks?\n\nCase in point - at the beginning of this last NHL season, Toronto Maple Leaf captain Mats Sundin gets hit in the eye. He refuses to wear facial protection, and he's out for the first month. Duh.\n\nLike everyone else in the sports world, I join in wishing Big Ben a full recovery. I hope we get to see him continue what many are now confident must be a hall of fame career. Do I feel sorry for him? Sure...but, for crying out loud, at what point do we hold people accountable for taking unnecessary risks? Wearing a helmet might have rendered this a great story about how he had the accident yet was ok.\n\nThis may not be a popular position, but heck, don't we as parents get upset with our 7 year olds for playing near the stairs or not looking both ways before crossing the street? If we expect kids to make smarter decisions in the interest of their own safety, why is it so easy to make excuses for ""adults""?",3085

They should point you in the right direction regarding financing options. Because your parents ""make too much money"" as is the case with the majority of college students, you will probably need to take out student loans. If you go through the U.S. Department of Education's Direct Loan program, the interest rates are extremely reasonable and payback schedules are flexible. \n\nBesides loans, you can also attain non-need-based grants, and scholarships through private institutions. Then, there are also work study programs.

6,"what are the advantages and disadvantages of finance on a personal basis? ; i need information on if britain is becoming a debt ridden society and have to compare adv and dis ad ; The advantage of taking out a loan is that you keep whatever savings or capital that you may have intact, for other investment purposes. This is particularly good, at a time when interest rates are low, so you pay very little for what you borrow and stand to make more by investing your savings in stocks, bonds, commodities etc.\n\nThis is however not a good strategy when interest rates go up, or, if you are taking finance at a high interest rate or over a very long term, because it is unlikely that investments would ever make up for the amount that you are paying in interest or fees.\n\nFor example, remortgaging a house to release equity which is then used to purchase say a car. A £20,000 car paid for in this way, using say a 25 year re-mortgage, could cost £50,000 in the end AND, assuming that a car only last for 10 years, you would have to continue paying for the car 15 years after it has gone to the knacker's yard. This is a very expensive use of money indeed!\n\nIn the UK, currently, a significant amount of personal debt is financed at high-ish interest rates. This makes the finance companies a lot of money but causes significant losses to the individual borrowing the money.",3137

0,"Please tell me your religion and what within your religion do you believe happens to you after you die? ; example: go to heaven/hell, reincarnation... please tell me the religion and then what the religion tells you about after death. ; What happens when we die?\nAccording to Hinduism, the body alone dies, the soul never dies. But the path the soul takes is decided upon by the past actions or Karmas. Past actions are attached to the soul and they decide the path of the soul’s travel. So if you are born with a disease or a handicap, it is the result of your past actions done in past lives. If you live a good moral pious life, then you will be born in better situation and ideal life.\n\nAccording to Hinduism, the soul continues this journey with a heavy load of Karmas, (good or bad) until it exhausts all Karmas by undergoing pain or pleasure sensations in the body. Then the individual soul, will merge with the Absolute Soul or infinite power. This merging process is known as Salvation.  \n\nGod does not punish us. God created man near to perfection and has given him the free will to decide whatever he wants. There is no such thing as being cursed. Hindus believe even God is bound by the law of Karma once He takes human form. Lord Krishna was killed by a hunter. He was obeying the law of Karma, the unwritten law of the Universe.\n\nKarma is a very just law, too, as it is equal in repayment. Karma, like gravity, treats everyone the same.\n\n\n"" Worn-out garments Are shed by the body:\n  Worn-out bodies Are shed by the dweller. ""  \n                                           \n                                                                -   (Bhagavad-Gita, II:22)\n\nReincarnation is interlinked with karma: successive lives afford the requisite scope in which the law of karma operates.  It is the natural way the soul evolves from immaturity to spiritual illumination. When all the lessons are worked out and all the lessons of life are learnt, one attains enlightenment and moksha (liberation). This means you will exist, but will no longer be pulled back to be born in a physical body. \n\nMoksha (Freedom or Salvation)\n\nMoksha means freedom from the cycle of birth and death. The ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death, or union with God. This union is achieved through true knowledge (jnana), devotion (bhakti), or right work (karma). Purity, self-control, truthfulness, non-violence, and compassion toward all forms of life are the necessary prerequisites for any spiritual path in Hinduism. There is no concept of Savior. You have to free yourself by your own effort. No savior can help you achieve God realization without your personal effort.",3173

Now push down quickly with your back leg, slamming the tail into the ground, and slide the edge of your front foot up the griptape.

My mum went back to nursing school at about 34, she wound up graduating near the top of her class - with a 3.97 GPA.  I didn't manage that on my bachelor's, and I went straight from high school.\n\nMy dad went back and got a COTA certification a few years after that, graduated and had absolutely no problems getting really good jobs.  Both of them had not attended any sort of college since they were 18 and married.  My father, in fact, wound up doing an ""academic bankruptcy"" on most of his classes, since he had things like a D in trigonometry (which he didn't even remember taking!!).  I don't remember his GPA, but it was like mine, somewhere above a 3.5 (but not a 3.97 - my mum set the bar WAY high.)\n\nThey both pointed out a couple of advantages and disadvantages to going back so late - one advantage I remember my mum and dad both mentioning was that when they did get placed in a job, they were able to start at slightly higher pay rates and were placed into supervisory positions fairly quickly due to other experience (ie, my dad did 18 years in the military and had been trained in management techniques which transferred over, etc).  A disadvantage I remember them discussing was that you have a harder time forming study groups and such while you're in class, because a lot of younger students aren't that responsible, although by med school I bet a lot of that's eliminated.\n\nGood luck, you're going to stress over tests, practicals, and clinicals, but don't stress too much, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Biological classifications, however, aim at establishing natural groups (i.e., groups that reflect the genealogy or descent of the organisms).\nSystematics is sometimes used with the same meaning as taxonomy, but it is a broader concept that comprises the scientific study of the types and diversity of organisms and their interelationships; other definitions are ""the science of biological classification"" or ""the science of organismal diversity"".",3295

9,"Do UN covenants have more effect than a country's own guidelines? ; Just wondering...\n\nI've been looking over their Charter and covenants and ... almost every nation in this world is guilty of ignoring their rules/guidelines.\n\nIs this supposed to happen?\n\nIt just seems like the UN really doesn't... have any effect whatsoever. ; The goal of the United Nations was to increase discussion between nations in an effort to prevent global conflict.  But has it worked or does it really have any jurisdiction over its members, no.  Many nations, such as the United States of America, have failed to ratify much of the UN charter.  For example, the US has not ratified the International Criminal Court, a separate judiciary entity somewhat affiliated with the UN.  However, the UN does play a somewhat integral part in maintaining communication with outside nations. A great example is the UN's efforts to aid with peacekeeping in Darfur.  Though this is seemingly unsuccessful, the UN has worked to maintatin the prescence of peacekeeping troops in the region. \n\nHowever, this leads to more problems.  Throughout the years, peacekeeping troops have been known to rape their refugees and commit other inappropriate acts during their mission. This increases the negative opinion of the UN and its actions among nations.  In addition, when nations such as the US blatantly violate the charter and the UN declarations, it suggests the ignorance of global opinion. These events lead to greater tension between nations instead of increased pacifism, as the body is designed for. \n\nNo nation, due to the act of sovereignty, must abide by the laws of the UN.  This is solely because if the rules of the UN were more heavily imposed than national law, prominent UN nations, the UK, US, France, etc., would have greater precedence in the domestic politics of smaller nations, such as Swaziland.  This would lead to an almost imperialistic setting where global superpowers would be able to enact laws that colonized developing nations and poverished nations.\n\nI hope this answers your question!",3340

He did a WONDERFUL job! 12 vertebrae were fused and 3 (only looks like 2) titanium rods were put in to straighten my back. It worked! I was so scared of having surgery. Scared of what could go wrong. My fears did have merit as things can go wrong, but if I could go back and do it all again, I would! I now wish I had had surgery sooner. I even LOVE the scar down my back (and the small one from the bone graft on my hip) and gained about an inch in height.\nAnother testament to the fact that the surgery was a success is that fact that as one of Jehovah's Witnesses, I do not accept blood transfusions. With a surgery this big one tends to loose blood, but because my surgeon agreed to use bloodless surgery equipment it was no problem! Everything went perfectly. I have also been in two major car accidents since my surgery and nothing broke or was damaged. I also actively ride horses, swim, and do everything I did before the surgery (ok, I do MORE now!). I have even been told I can go bungee jumping and on roller coasters if I want! hehe\n\nFeel free to contact me if you ever want to talk about surgery or anything.

This order has direct fertilization, which means they have direct copulation without the use of a spermatophore. The spermatophore is typically reserved for the more primitive insects like collembola (springtails) and other wingless varieties. Scorpions will also use spermatopheres, but once again they are fairly primitive.\nMany orthopterans will have a plug which they insert into the female which acts to block or inhibit any other males from mating, this is sometimes refered to as the spermatophore. They also have what is known as a Spermatophalax, this is a sperm-free portion of the spermatophore which the female will eat in order to obtain more energy for egg production\n\nhope this helps!",3659

The scrubber removes other gases such as CO2, H2S, Nitrogen and water vapor.  They often use absorption or other techniques to remove the unwanted scavanger gases.  All gas that is transported, must be treated to pipeline grade.  That is it must be treated to meet certain standards of purity--moisture content, btu, hazardous gases, etc.  Scrubbers are designed based on the gas analysis for a particular gas field.  For example, gas generated at a wastewater treatment plant will require the removal of CO2 and H2O.  Other gas fields may require the removal of other impurities.",3778

1,"what holds the photoreceptors? ; its on a worksheet called ""the eyes have it"" and i need all the answers!!! lol ; The photoreceptors are located in the retina of the eye.  The outer segments of the photoreceptors are responsible for catching photons of light, which initiates an electochemical signal that ultimately results in vision.  There are two main types of photoreceptors, rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in lower light levels, while cones are responsible for color and most form recognition.  Rods are dispersed throughout the retina, while cones are most densely packed in the region of the retina responsible for your central, or ""straight ahead,"" vision.  This area is called the macula.  In fact, the center of the macula, the fovea, contains only cones, and they are very densely packed in this area to allow for higher resolution of fine detail.",3785

Basically learn to jump on a small jump and increase your speed and the size of the jumps you're hitting as you get more comfortable.\n\nWhen you start snowboarding be mentally prepared for a challenge.  It usually takes at least a full day to catch on (and often times a few days).  You want to practice staying on the edge of your board and turning to stop.  Once you can go a short distance and stop, practice edging down on your toe side and then transfering your weight to your heals (making you turn the other direction slightly) and edging on your heals.  Going back and forth smoothly from heal to toe and back is called carving.  That's the first thing you want to learn to do when you start snowboarding.\n\nGood Luck!!!",3846

I have been eatting low fat meals with grains, fruits and veggies and some meat. I have also been having fat free yogurt and have switched to skim milk in my tea. Everything I eat seems to cause rumbling and send me running.\n\nWhat worked for you???\n\nThanks for sharing your ideas - Trish ; Poor baby!! I'm afraid you're going to have to go bland for a while, until your system gets accustomed to the gall bladder being gone. The good news is that the rumbling & running will get better about a month or so after surgery. As far as grains go, they can cause excess gas so maybe cut back on those. Also, certain types of veggies, broccoli or cauliflower can cause upset. When you do yogurt, be sure you get the kind with active, live cultures in it. You might try toast & boiled eggs for breakfast, or even scrambled eggs as long as nothing greasy was used to cook them. Oddly enough, I can eat Mexican any time I want & not get sick, so it's going to be a trial & error thing for you for a bit after you heal. Apple sauce, jello, pudding, soups - nothing fatty or greasy. Sorta stick to the BRAT diet - bananas, rice, apple sauce & toast - it helps. Plus the yogurt!! I think you're on the right track, but it really does take 4 to 6 weeks for the rumbling to calm down. If it doesn't, a gastroenterologist can prescribe a medication you can use with your meals to help your system adjust. It's a powder you sprinkle on your food. Good luck & hang in there - it does get better!!",3922
9,"what does the dead parachutist symbolize, in the lord of the flies.? ; does he symbolize other than what the beast and the Lord of THE FLIES SYMBOLIZE? ; The air battle and dead parachutist remind us of the larger setting of Lord of the Flies: though the boys lead an isolated life on the island, we know that a bloody war is being waged elsewhere in the world—a war that apparently is a terrible holocaust. All Golding tells us is that atom bombs have threatened England in a war against “the reds” and that the boys were evacuated just before the impending destruction of their civilization. The war is also responsible for the boys’ crash landing on the island in the first place, because an enemy aircraft gunned down their transport plane. Although the war remains in the background of Lord of the Flies, it is nevertheless an important extension of the main themes of the novel. Just as the boys struggle with the conflict between civilization and savagery on the island, the outside world is gripped in a similar conflict. War represents the savage outbursts of civilization, when the desire for violence and power overwhelms the desire for order and peace. Even though the outside world has bestowed upon the boys a sense of morality and order, the danger of savagery remains real even within the context of that seemingly civilized society that has nurtured them.",3923

I have some ideas of my own and before i implement the same, i wanted to have some of my  inquisitives cleared. Hence this post. The electricity generated in small amounts to large amounts have to be stored for later usage. is this possible? if so, how and how long can the stored electricity be made available for usage. once this is answered i have further questions related to this topic and those knowledgeable may kindly help answering the same; for the betterment of our society / humankind. Thanks and Regards - JON ; You can store it in batteries and it lasts as long as the batteries last.\n\nThe sun produces a huge amount of energy every day (173 millions of billions Watts). The amount we receive generates wind (converted into electricity through windmills), heat, photosynthesis of plants and trees and 1.37kw of energy per square metre. This energy can be harnessed by PV cells and converted into electricity. In fact, less than 1% of our planet’s desert areas would generate all the electricity we need if it was covered with PV panels.\nGenerating electricity this way is quite simple: light hits a cell made of a thin layer of silicium over a metal support which generates electrons. The motion of these electrons generates current. PV cells are assembled in panels, generating up to 100w/h of DC power (14v approximately). These panels are connected to a regulator, which controls the electricity production, sends some to appliances, some to battery storage and dumps any excess. PV panels generate electricity when subjected to sunlight. This means they do not produce at night. This is why most systems store electricity in batteries.\n \nHOUSING APPLICATIONS\nA modern house does not require a lot of electricity and it does not seem very efficient to burn diminishing fossil resources in huge plants located far away and then transport this electricity over hundreds of kilometers to houses. By having a few PV panels on the roof, any ordinary house can generate its electrical needs; this power can be supplied in DC (for halogen lighting for example) and AC (220V) through an inverter to power standard appliances.\n \nA house connected to the grid can then sell electricity by day and buy some back at night.\nAn independent house generates all its needs by storing electricity in battery banks. In windy areas, a windmill can be a very good complement to PV systems.\n \nPV systems do not require fuel, have no moving parts that can wear, require virtually no maintenance and last for a very long time (some PV systems have a 30 years warranty).\n \nINDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\nThey constitute the bulk of the applications today, for remote lighting, transmitters, satellites in space, etc. Industrial buildings could also produce part of their needs through PV.\n \nCOST MATTERS\nIs PV technology expensive? Prices are now going down and make it ever more competitive. PV systems last a very long time and over say 50 years, they should become extremely competitive.\nThe cost of fossil fuels is expected to increase over the next 20 years. Furthermore, fossil fuel generators require heavy maintenance. Another aspect to take in account is the pollution they generate: this has a heavy cost in terms of global warming, poor air quality, health problems and logistic costs (transport of fossil fuels, electricity on high power lines and their waste), not to mention collateral damage such as oil slicks, Chernobyl type accidents, respiratory diseases, chemical runoffs and other nasty results.",3969

9,"How long does it take to become an attorney from start of college to end of law school, whats the pay like? ; I am interested in going into law. ; If you attend a law school on a full-time basis, it should take you 3 years to finish the academic requirements for your Juris Doctorate (JD).\n\nThe pay depends considerably on the field of law that you choose. Top-tier law firms hire the best and brightest of law school graduates at very high salaries - smaller firms pay far less - mom and pop shops pay even less - as do public defenders and state attorneys offices - non-profit organizations and public interest groups can pay almost nothing. Then there are corporations - most major corporations have in-house legal divisions that work with outside counsel to help a company with its day-to-day operations and assist with lawsuits.\n\nThink VERY carefully before you decide to attend law school. You can EASILY accumulate more than $100,000 in debt in those three years - and you'll need a very well paying job to retire that kind of loan. If you're not at the top of your class, you won't be starting out making a ton of money, although the opportunity might well present itself once you've become established.\n\nFor most attorneys, the practice of law is extremely time-consuming, especially in the early years, when you're first starting out.\n\nNever choose a profession because it seems like a good way to ""make a lot of money."" Choose a profession because it's something you'd like to think you can enjoy doing for the rest of your life.\n\nP.S.: Assuming that it takes you a standard 4 years to finish your undergraduate degree (though that seems to be less and less common these days), it will take you at least 7 years to complete the requirements for a JD. Once you have completed law school, you must study for, and pass your state's bar exam - most law school graduates complete the bar exam preparation during the summer immediately following the completion of law school coursework.\n\nAlso keep in mind that law school admission is highly competitive at most schools (particularly the good ones!), and graduate study (MBA, etc.) is sometimes considered a strong plus for a law school applicant. If you were to elect this route, you would have to add at least another 2 years of schooling to earn a masters, or some other advanced credential.",4000

0,"What is ""Jehovah"" religion? ; what is it? what's the big idea? ; In most ways Jehovah’s Witnesses are like everyone else. They have normal problems—economic, physical, emotional. They make mistakes at times, for they are not perfect, inspired, or infallible. But they try to learn from their experiences and diligently study the Bible to make needed corrections. They have made a dedication to God to do his will, and they apply themselves to fulfill this dedication. In all their activities they seek guidance from God’s Word and his holy spirit.\n\nIt is of vital importance to them that their beliefs be based on the Bible and not on mere human speculations or religious creeds. They feel as did the apostle Paul when he expressed himself under inspiration: “Let God be found true, though every man be found a liar.” (Romans 3:4, New World Translation) When it comes to teachings offered as Biblical truth, the Witnesses strongly endorse the course followed by the Beroeans when they heard the apostle Paul preach: “They received the word with the greatest eagerness of mind, carefully examining the Scriptures daily as to whether these things were so.” (Acts 17:11) Jehovah’s Witnesses believe that all religious teachings should be subjected to this test of agreement with the inspired Scriptures, whether the teaching is offered by them or by someone else.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses believe in the Bible as the Word of God. They consider its 66 books to be inspired and historically accurate. What is commonly called the New Testament they refer to as the Christian Greek Scriptures, and the Old Testament they call the Hebrew Scriptures. They rely on both of these, the Greek and the Hebrew Scriptures, and take them literally except where the expressions or settings obviously indicate that they are figurative or symbolic. They understand that many of the prophecies of the Bible have been fulfilled, others are in the course of fulfillment, and still others await fulfillment.\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses? The way they refer to themselves. It is a descriptive name, indicating that they bear witness concerning Jehovah, his Godship, and his purposes. “God,” “Lord,” and “Creator”—like “President,” “King,” and “General”—are titles and may be applied to several different personages. But “Jehovah” is a personal name and refers to the almighty God and Creator of the universe. This is shown at Psalm 83:18, according to the King James version of the Bible: “That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.”\n\nThe Scriptural account that Jehovah’s Witnesses draw on for their name is in the 43rd chapter of Isaiah. There the world scene is viewed as a courtroom drama: The gods of the nations are invited to bring forth their witnesses to prove their claimed cases of righteousness or to hear the witnesses for Jehovah’s side and acknowledge the truth. Jehovah there declares to his people: “Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me. I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.”—Isaiah 43:10, 11, American Standard Version.\n\nSome 6,000,000 persons today who are telling the good news of Jehovah’s Kingdom by Christ Jesus in over 235 lands feel that they properly refer to themselves as Jehovah’s Witnesses.\n\nWith Bible Studies, we will use any Bible that the person may have, King James, America Standard, Catholic, etc, etc, you may have heard that we have our own Bible, and that it is the only one we will use, that is not true, the TRUTH can be found in any Bible, I personally have a King James Bible with me at all times in the Ministry because many people prefer that version of the Bible.",4182

2,"Viagra, Cialis or Levitra? Wich is the best solution for erectile dysfunction? ; I am thinking to use Viagra or Cialis or Levitra since I have heard a lot about these for erectile dysfunction from where I can get it! ; A significant number of men develop impotence from psychological causes that can be overcome. When a physiological cause is treated, subsequent self-esteem problems may continue to impair normal function and performance. Qualified therapists (e.g., sex counselors, psychotherapists) work with couples to reduce tension, improve sexual communication, and create realistic expectations for sex, all of which can improve erectile function. Psychological therapy may be effective in conjunction with medical or surgical treatment. Sex therapists emphasize the need for men and their partners to be motivated and willing to adapt to psychological and behavioral modifications, including those that result from medical or surgical treatment.\n\nMedical Treatment Oral Medication Oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction include selective enzyme inhibitors (e.g., sildenafil Viagra , vardenafil HCl [Levitra], tadalafil [Cialis]) and yohimbine (Yohimbine, Yocon).\n\nSelective enzyme inhibitors are available by prescription and may be taken up to once a day to treat [5]ED. They improve partial erections by inhibiting the enzyme that facilitates their reduction and increase levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP, a chemical factor in metabolism), which causes the smooth muscles of the penis to relax, enabling blood to flow into the corpora cavernosa. Patients taking nitrate drugs (used to treat chest pain) and those taking alpha-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure and benign prostatic hyperplasia) should not take selective enzyme inhibitors.\n\nMen who have had a heart attack or stroke within the past 6 months and those with certain medical conditions (e.g., uncontrolled high blood pressure, severe low blood pressure or liver disease, unstable angina) that make sexual activity inadvisable should not take [6]Cialis®. Dosages of the drug should be limited in patients with kidney or liver disorders.\n\nViagra is absorbed and processed rapidly by the body and is usually taken 30 minutes to 1 hour before intercourse. Results vary depending on the cause of [7]erectile dysfunction, but studies have shown that Viagra is effective in 75% of cases. It helps men with erectile dysfunction associated with diabetes mellitus (57%), spinal cord injuries (83%), and radical prostatectomy (43%).\n\nIn clinical studies, Levitra has been shown to work quickly, provide consistent results, and improve sexual function in most men the first time they take the drug. It also has shown to be effective in men of all ages, in patients with diabetes mellitus, and in men who have undergone radical prostatectomy. Cialis has been shown in clinical trials to stay in the body longer than the other selective enzyme inhibitors. It promotes erection within 30 minutes and enhances the ability to achieve erection for up to 36 hours.\n\nhttp://www.edpills.net/article_viagra_cialis_levitra.php",4199
0,"What does it mean to be Emo? ; Can someone explain it to me. What would someone look like or what activies would they do? Can someone define it. I am a 31 year old housewife and i don't know exactly what this term means. ; Emo is short for emotional.  Now, in the society today, it has turned into a high school stereotype such as jocks, nerds, geeks, goths, and groups like that.  If someone were to be stereotyped as emo, they would generally keep to themselves, be more timid than others, and not really want to do anything about it.  The majority of kids who fit this stereotype generally like to listen to music.  They feel it helps them escape the stresses of reality.  Music has essentially become their anti-drug.  Most kids have jumped into this fad thinking it's cool for guys to wear girl pants and wear black and such, but hey, if they want to express themselves like that, more power to them.  Everyone, to an extent, is ""emo,"" considering it is derived from the word emotional, and if you're not emotional, you're not human.  \n\nLooks:  \n\n""Emo"" girls tend to have shorter hair with sweeping bangs that cover one eye.  \n\nGuys tend to wear tighter jeans with the same hair cut.\n\nPiercings on the face are usually a big thing.

So should I go ahead and try it? ; I was on the same thing for a little while. It is an anti-psychotic drug, but that doesn't mean your prescriber thinks you're psychotic, both anti-depressants and anti-psychotics are used for numerous conditions not just depression or psychosis.\nI stopped taking it because it didn't do a thing, not that I noticed anyway.\nForget any stigma you may think is attached to certain drugs of diagnosis, focus on being well and getting better and improving these things, what may have caused you to be unwell shouldn't be all you focus on, if you do that it can take over your life altogether, believe me I really do know about that, it's what happened to me.\nYou could also get a second opinion, and probably should, it's amazing how doctors diagnosis can vary so much from each other, I think it's worth seeing  another doctor even if only so YOU can look at your situation from a different angle.\nHope this helps a bit and good luck",4215

1,"Please tell me what we did wrong with this proof.  The question is:Let a,b and c be integers such that c.....? ; divides a*b. Then either c divides a or c divides b.\nFirst, we tried a bunch of examples, like when c=3 and ab=27, so a =3 and b=9, and you see that c divides a and c divides b.  Or another one is when c=7 and ab=56, so a=7 and b=8, and we know that 7 divides 56 and also 7 divides 7. Also, if c=12 and a=5 and b=24, then ab=120, and you see that c divides 120, and slo c divides b, which is all we need because the conjecture is an ""or"" statement so we only need one of the conditions to be true.  So we decided that the conjecture is true. Proof: Let a,band c be integers. We will prove the conjecture by contrapositive. So we assume that c doesn't divide a and that c doesn't divide b. We will show that c doesn't divide a*b. Since c doesn't dived a, then we know that a doesn't = c*m. Also, c doesn't divide b, so we know that b doesn't = s*n. So ab doesn't = (cm)(cn)=c(cmn). Now, cmn is an integer q(since c,m and n are all integers).Thus ab doesn't = cq for any int q. So c doesn't divide ab. ; Well, the basic problem you've run into is that the conjecture isn't true.  If a = 6, b = 3, and c = 9, then a*b = 18, and 18/9 = 2, but neither 6 nor 3 is divisible by 9.\n\nTo prove that something is true you must prove it is true for all possible values of the variables, in this case a, b, and c.  However, to prove something is false, you need only supply a single counter-example.  Thus the above example disproves the conjecture that for all integers a, b, and c if a*b is divisible by c then a or b is also divisible by c.\n\nNote that a ≠ cm and b ≠ cn does not imply that ab ≠ c(cmn).  For example, if a = 6, b = 8, c = 2, m = 4, and n = 3, then cm = 2*3 = 8 ≠6 so cm ≠ a, and cn = 2 * 3 = 6 ≠ 8 so cn ≠ b.  However, (cm)(cn) = 2 * 4 * 2 * 3 = 48, and a * b = 6 * 8 = 48, so ab = (cm)(cn).  This proves that you cannot multiply not-equalities (i.e. statements with ""doesn't equal).\n\nAlso, concluding that if c does not divide a or b implies that c does not divide ab is not the same as concluding that if c does divide ab it must also divide a or b.  This logical fallacy is equivalent to the statement that for all plants, not a tree implies not a rock, so being a rock implies being a tree.  The first statement is true: all plants that are not trees are also not rocks.  However, the second statement is clearly false, as no rocks are also trees.",4219

If you think about what things you are eating that cause you to gain weight & cut back on them, as well as maintain a moderate exercise routine, you should start to shed pounds.

Unless unemployment in the US (and Canada for that matter) is at zero percent which it has never been.  then there are 'legal' citizens who need the work, and would pay taxes.

2,"can it be helped? ; can ppl actually grow taller if they jump and stretch alot? ; In theory, it's actually the reverse...it will make you shorter.  Let me explain how it works.  \n\nWhen you jump and stretch (some muscle groups), compressive forces act on your spine and intervertebral disks.  Some of the forces are vertical, some are interdiagonal.  Your disks are collagen packets filled with water. As you jump and stretch (specific muscles) you decrease the amount of water inside the disks part of which help make up the height of your torso.  Throughout the course of the day this happens naturally anyway, however physical activity such as those activities mentioned can accerlate the process.  As you sleep and rest, the water is then reabsorbed.  That's why people are typically up to 0.5 inches taller in the morning.",4267

As forex says - if a predator, like a spider, approaches, some species drop on a line of silk to avoid getting eaten. At other times and with other types of caterpillars, they dangle on a line because they're ready to turn into moths. They need a safer place to make a cocoon and pupate so they dangle until it feels right and then, hopefully, the wind will blow them into a lower, warmer and safer place to spend the winter in their cocoon. In the spring, they turn into moths and lay eggs on the leaves of the same type of tree that they grew up on. They’re usually small moths that nobody ever sees - unless they look.

Here in NZ, Telecom gave money to both main parties before the last election.   What's the point of that?   They""re opponents. ; Its rather easy for people to conclude that political contributions are just bribes of some sort but that really overstates the case.\n\nI have donated money, helped convince others to donate, been a professional fund raiser and, as a candidate for congress, been the recipient of campaign contributions.\n\nWhat do you get when you give money? Not a quid pro quo but access. So, when there is something happening that you're interested in, you can pick up the phone and call a Senator and he will take your call or ask him out for lunch and he'll accept or show up at his office and he'll talk to you. \n\nThat doesn't mean he'll do what you want but obviously its easier to convince someone if you can actually have a serious personal conversation with him.\n\nWhen I was running for congress (I lost by the way), I had all sorts of big corporations contribute to my campaign. Never once did anyone even suggest that they expected a particular vote on a particular matter. \n\nAnd, I might add, there are a lot of people who just like the idea of being able to get a congressman or senator on the phone whenever they want or who expect to get invited to the White House so they can impress their friends.\n\nThis is not to say that contributions that amount to bribes don't ever happen.

Do you take it for granted that you are Christian/Muslim/Jewish / Hindu  ..etc, or have you looked closely at other religions to see if they offer you something you appreciate more? ; Have you examined other religions?\nHere is a true story: A woman was growing up in a very religious home, religion being a part of life for her. When her wonderful mother died too young from overmedication by physicians, she could not believe that there was a God. \n\nLater she studied sacred symbols from around the world and discovered that all ancient healing religions hold truth and have our main energy fields as common concern. She discovered that the Bible is filled with knowledge about our energy fields, nowadays often called ""new age."" She also found these energy fields mentioned in Mayan, Chinese, East Indian, ancient Egyptian, Germanic and other healing religions of yore. \n\nProfessor Herman Wirth Roeper Bosch pointed out that there had been a monotheistic religion in the stone age, the believe in the Great Mother. Of course, in time the role of the father came to mind and the father gods became more common. The question arose, is God male or female?\n\nThe woman thought about God, and concluded that ""he"" was actually ""it"" for if God exists before creation, God was not created, is above and beyond all creation, neither male nor female. Yet, God is also in creation itself. There is deus absconditus of the Hebrews, the God unknowable, the God before creation; and there is the other side of God, God the creator and in all creation.\n\nIt is interesting that the ancient symbols deliver the message the knowledge of which, we, the modern humans, have generally lost together with the faith in the one God and in our holy energy fields.\n\nThe book ""The (W)Hole book on Mimbres Pots"" (by Dr. Bara H. Fischer-Loveland) shows some of the symbolism in connection with some our energy fields, illustrated by ancient Native American symbolism. The book is sometimes available on the Internet (second hand, Amazon or Barnes and Noble). It will soon be available as e-book at www.biochakra.com. Expect more books on sacred symbols and their meaning in e-book form at www.biochakra.com.\n\nI have found a look at and into other religions fascinating! I have visited Russian-orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues, catholic churches, Episcopal churches of England, the domes of Europe, holy stone settings of the Celts, mosques, a stupa, ancient kivas etc. They are all holy places for me from the energy left by the prayers of the many. The holy places have often been built on very ancient sacred sites, and one can feel it!\n\nGod is in all creation.\nCordially,\nIndia.Magica",4461

Any ideas? ; 1. as far as your gall bladder problem, several studies have shown that fatty meals may not play as much of a role in the colicky type of pain associated with either stones or a malfunctioning gall bladder, however all the patients I treat and including myself who has what is called ""cholelithiasis"" find that certain meals will set off an attack. It is probably a good idea when you eat to have several small meals per day rather than the traditional three meals. Smaller portions throughout the day may help with your gall bladder pains.\n2. Now for your diagnosis of IBS. This is usually a diagnosis of exclusion which means you must rule out other more ominous causes, ie. Crohn's Disease, Ulcerative Colitis both can be detected with a colonoscopy. Additionally, you should be tested for what is called ""gluten sensitivity"" and ""celiac sprue"". There are blood tests that can shed light on these disorders such as a test called ""gliadin antibodies"". Your GI doctor may also want to take some biopsies of your colon during the colonscopy so a Pathologist can microscopically determine what type if any inflammation is going on and what the mucosal lining of the intestine looks like. Flattening of the mucosa may be indicative of some of the diseases I mentioned previously. \n3. When you go out to eat, the problem is that if you are allergic to peanuts, many times they will cook with peanut oil and there may even be remnants of peanuts or the oil in preparing your food. This can be very dangerous. I had a patient several years ago who was allergic to peanuts and ate out at McDonalds I believe and there were trace amounts of peanuts or peanut oil which threw him into anaphylactic shock; thank goodness he survived. So you have to be very very careful and let the restaurant know that you are allergic to peanuts, oils, or any by product of peanuts. \nI hope this helps you. You should speak to a Gastroenterologist and have a colonoscopy and some blood work to check for the antibodies. Gluten sensitivity usually goes hand in hand with wheat allergies. There are newer medications that will help with irritable bowel syndrome. Zelnorm is the one that comes to mind. For some reason when it first came to market it was only for women, I assume because most cases of IBS are in females, but more recent studies show that it can be effective in relieving the symptoms of IBS in men too.\nRegards,\nWarren Shaffer, M.D.",4564

We live so far away from everywhere else (even south America and/or Canada for most of the US) that we just have not had the experience. I'm think i am more knowledgable than most ppl i know, on Europe anyway, since my in-laws are from Liverpool and one of my good friends and her hubby are Irish, but i don't think most ppl in the US even know a person that is from another country (that is not a S. Am country). I know if you live in Englad, Germany, Spain, Italy ect...you can fly to another country in a matter of a few hours and it is fairly cheap. Honestly most Americans would love to be able to visit (can I stay at your house lol) but it is to expensive. I think this goes along with the education question. Its not that we don't learn our history, it is just much easier to remember something if you have visited the place (i can give you quite a detailed account of the Alamo) or if your family was involved (Revolution, cilvil war). If you are wondering if we learn about the daily habits (such as food perference, job opportunities, fashion) of the modern English at school no we don't, but I really don't think that it would be the job of the school to teach this.\n\n\nI also think that the reason we love accents is because we rarely hear them!

Cost $22 on average per item.\n\nYou can see a professional hypnotist or a physiatrist who will help you work you through your fear in a safe non threatening environment.  However this option is the most expensive and time consuming because it takes many sessions and time to feel you can trust or open up fully to another person.\n\n\n\n*If you use drugs as a crutch you can become addicted and that would start a whole new problem. \nP.S. the side affects of many tranquilizer drugs are feelings of anxiety and panic which you don’t want anyway.\n\n*The body is affected the same with legal and illicit drugs (downers or relaxants) like tranquillizers, sleeping pills or (marijuana, heroin, and alcohol) \n*Stimulants which are (speed, & cocaine) (cigarettes = nicotine), (tea & coffee =caffeine), and (ice & ecstasy which is often a combination of both stimulants and relaxants). \n*Cigarettes, Alcohol, and Marijuana are most accepted by the general public however they cause the most disease related deaths. Through internal organ diseases, like *Cancers and Blood clots (causing amputations, strokes and heart attacks) \n*Lung diseases from asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and cancer.  \n*Liver diseases from damage trying to alienate the body of toxic poisons and chemicals associated with medications and alcohol over years. \n*Hepatitis, sclerosis, and cancers of the liver.  \n*Marijuana has a chemical THC which our body has receptor in our brain and we also store for long periods in our blood and fat cells; (up to one month each time you smoke just one joint). Regular bong smokers and users will cause many different chronic health problems including lung disease (as the same toxic chemicals are in tobacco and marijuana excepting nicotine which is a stimulant) mental health suffers with paranoia, anxiety, fear, loss of memory, loss of appetite or increased appetite for sweets, loss of motivation, poor health, poor sleeping patterns and a dependency to use marijuana to get to sleep. Personal hygiene problems like sweating, bad breath and rotting teeth and the best for last you only feel mellow for a short time the rest of the time you are short tempered and unbearable to be around.\n*All drugs both legal and illicit have one thing in common the same side affects which is anxiety and withdrawal symptoms.",4735

9,"Has voter apathy ruined the U.K? In a recent survey British politicians were voted more sleazy than estate? ; agents, with that public perception, very few of the population voted and Tony Blair's Labour got another term. Labour is turning Britain into such a police state, that even the Scots want their own country, but arn't the voters to blame as well? Isn't voter apathy destroying the British way of life? ; Voting apathy is only a problem for the elected representatives (MPs and councillors) of the people.  They fear that if not enough of us turn out to vote, they will feel they do not have a mandate to govern.  I think we reached that point about fifty years ago.  If the turn out is under 50 percent, how can any politician legitimately claim to have received a mandate from the people to govern them?\n\nLocal elections are a case in point - the same shipload of cut-throats get re-elected time and time again.  They draw huge expenses (at our expense) and waist their time going on various jamborees abroad to see if the wine is safe for us to drink back home.\n\nMPs are the worse scoundrels.  Many of these thieves draw expenses amounting to £150,000 pa on top of their already bloated salaries of £60,000.  God only knows what government ministers are paid - something resembling a telephone number I should think.\n\nOn the whole I think the British people are let down badly by their representatives most of whom pay little or no attention what so ever to what we the people are saying, once they're elected that is - another five years on the jolly waggon at our expense.  And to cap it all, these people want us to pay for their political parties and their profligate spending.  Oh, never mind, the tax payer will foot the bill.  VOTE NO to that by the way.",4767

Remember that the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world...The question is ""who do you want to rock your child's cradle."" Information is not just learned by giving your child books and telling to read and ask questions but it's who and how teaches them to remember what is being taught. Teach them about safe sex. When you are teaching about safe sex, that doesn't mean that they are going out there to have promiscuous sex but rather to protect themselves should things happen. It's your job as a parent to teach them the rights and wrongs. Christian or not.

DARPA created the Information Processing Technology Office to further the research of the Semi Automatic Ground Environment program, which had networked country-wide radar systems together for the first time. J. C. R. Licklider was selected to head the IPTO, and saw universal networking as a potential unifying human revolution. Licklider recruited Lawrence Roberts to head a project to implement a network, and Roberts based the technology on the work of Paul Baran who had written an exhaustive study for the U.S. Air Force that recommended packet switching to make a network highly robust and survivable. After much work, the first node went live at UCLA on October 29, 1969 on what would be called the ARPANET, the ""eve"" network of today's Internet. \n\nPeople behind it: Licklider, Lawrence Roberts, Paul Baran for the military\nFirst node went live: Oct 29, 1969, UCLA\nBirth place: UCLA campus\n\nThe first TCP/IP wide area network was operational by January 1, 1983 (this is technically the birth of the Internet), when the United States' National Science Foundation (NSF) constructed a university network backbone that would later become the NSFNet. It was then followed by the opening of the network to commercial interests in 1995. Important separate networks that offered gateways into, then later merged into the Internet include Usenet, Bitnet and the various commercial and educational X.25 networks such as Compuserve and JANET. The ability of TCP/IP to work over these pre-existing communication networks allowed for a great ease of growth. Use of Internet as a phrase to describe a single global TCP/IP network originated around this time.\n\nName first given to it: NSFNet\nFirst operational: Jan 1 1983 (birth of internet as we know it)\nNational campuses - birthplace of internet framework\n\nAs of January 2006, over 1 billion people use the Internet according to Internet World Stats",4796

1,"How are Trees able to Suck Water so high, all the way to the Top of the Tree? ; Only Biological Anwers Expected ; Transpiration, the properties of water, and the vascular tissues help the trees to suck water from the very bottom of the roots to the top of the tree leaves. Transpiration is caused when water is sucked from the root tips of the tree and into the vascular tissue called xylem. Because two of the properties of water state that water is adhesive (they stick to stuff) and cohesive (they stick together), these water molecules stick to the xylem as well as each other, using it's bonds to pull each other up the tree. And when the stomata (the hole on the underside of the leaf) opens for gas exchange, one water molecule at a time evaporates from the leaf, thus pulling the chain up one by one. Hope that helps!",4875

Distribution will be completed December 22, but should I sell before or after?  When is best time? ; If you are cashing out, then it would not make a difference if you sell before or after the distrubtion date. However, if you can wait till next year you can differ your capital gains tax.\n\nIf you are putting money into the fund then it is best to invest after the distrubtion date. Typically when a fund pays out (dividends & cap gains) the NAV (Price) drops; however, the number of shares you own increases if you selected for dividend/cap gain reinvestment.

However, the capital gain distrubtions may be taxable (If not in an IRA), and therefore, it is best to differ your taxes to next year (Assuming that you are in the same tax bracket next year)",4878
9,"Anti smokers - are you prepared to give up your cars? ; It is only due to another question regarding smoking that I ask this. The simple fact is more people are affected by pollution from cars than are affected by second smoke.

But they never look at the money that smokers bring into the NHS. Cigarette tax makes up a huge portion of the cost of cigarettes and pays a large amout of NHS costs.\n\nI don't like breathing car exhaust fumes every day and the rise in Asthma has been linked to the replacement of lead in petrol with the lung irritant Benzine.

3,"Propertius Help!!? ; In book III of the Elegies I need help with the poem ""Midnight and A Letter Comes to Me"". Trying to figure out the meaning and or purpose. ; Pound’s knowledge of a foreign tongue became a big red herring in the reception of his next large work, Homage to Sextus Propertius. Its twelve poems, stitched together from separate passages of the Augustan love elegist, contain many “poker-faced misreadings” (Kenner’s phrase) planted to infuriate dons. Pound knew what he was doing, for the results are almost always bilingually funny. In long, loping lines full of the sort of place names and proper names Pound adored stuffing into his verses, he echoes and transmutes the Roman poet’s contempt for high politics and obsession with his girlfriend. “Poem III” (“Midnight, and a letter comes to me from our mistress”) finds the poet on the Via Sciro at night, hoping that “The moon will carry his candle,/ The stars will point out the stumbles.” The familiar Greekoid rhythms are here inflected with a self-deprecating humor. The timorously polysyllabic accents of a cowed male are amusingly caught in VII (“Me happy, night, night full of brightness;/ Oh couch made happy by my long delectations”) and in X (“Light, light of my eyes, at an exceeding late hour I was wandering,/ And intoxicated,/ … There were upon the bed no signs of a voluptuous encounter,/ No signs of a second incumbent”). Uncaught by commentators, “Homage” rises to a sly lewdness: “Bright tips reach up from twin towers,/ Anienan spring water falls into flat-spread pools.” Propertius is an (anti-) war poem in explicitly rejecting public poetry (“And I will also sing war songs when this matter of a girl is exhausted”) and epic poetry (“And if she plays with me with her shirt off,/ We shall construct many Iliads”). Influenced by the Eliot of Prufrock and by Jules Laforgue’s deflating ironies, Homage insists on a separate erotic peace. Ironically, Pound abjured epic with more aplomb and finesse than he later embraced it.",4926

2,"Milk... cancer? ; I happen to hear this rumor about milk being a cause of Cancer.. I looked it up in google and found quite a few links regarding this... it comes to me as a shock... Is it True?? ; Cow's milk doesn't directly cause cancer.\n\nThe worst part about cow's milk is the process it goes through to get from the cow's udder to your grocery store.   Typically, it is altered beyond recognition.  It is standardized, fortified, pasteurized and homongenized.  In other words, it has been taken apart and put back together again, not always in the same proportions. Then it will be cooked and emulsified.\n\nHowever, many humans actually have mild allergies to the substance, which is nutrionally incompatible with their bodies.  In these cases, milk consumption can trigger acne outbreaks, sinusitis, constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\nOn the other hand, those who experience no allergic reactions can drink it with no problems, and will wholeheartedly stand out on the streets and proclaim, ""Milk is good for you!  Drink it by the gallon!""  And for them, it may be.  But it's not for everyone.\n\nSo, what transforms an otherwise  healthy milk products into allergens and carcinogens?  It all starts with modern feeding methods that substitute high-protein, soy-based feeds for fresh green grass; and breeding methods to produce cows with abnormally large pituitary glands so that they produce three times more milk than they a traditional cow.\n\nThen, the cows are given antibiotics to keep them well. Their milk is then pasteruized so that all valuable enzymes are destroyed; lactase, which assimilates lactose; galactose, which  assimilates galactose; phosphatase, for the assimilation of calcium. Literally dozens of precious enzymes are destroyed in the pasteruization process. Without them, milk is very difficult to digest. The human pancreas is not always able to produce these enzymes; over-stress of the pancreas can lead to disease.\n\nHope this helped explain it a little better.  Raw, organic, whole cow's milk is in no way cancer-causing.  It's really more the process it goes through to become store-ready that could, in a sense, contribute to cancer development in some people.",4966

I agree with 'andytheba..' and 'itschris', above.

Tabs sometimes, though rarely, contain some musical information. This is similar  to standard musical notation. A large number of tabs, however, just provide you with the basic information and you use the recording to to reference it.\n\nAn example :  ----0-2-3-5--- played on the A string (second fattest) is telling you to play the notes A, B, C and D. If the numbers read ----0-2-4-5--- they would be telling you to play the notes A, B, C# and D.   Since you already read standard music notation - the piano music - you have a glorious head start but, as I said, alot of Tablature (tabs) dispenses with all the note value notation and provides you with just the 'finger pathway' through the music you listen to or want to learn.

And there's even a girl on there who claims that William and Kate are almost over (which I have read a recent article on William cheating on her) and that William will meet a blond girl soon from his past and basically insinuating she is the future wife. I don't mean to blow anyone's cover, or say that they are impossible or false. But do you really think anybody knows William's future wife?\n\nIf you ask me, I do feel Kate and William may break up soon or in the next two years and that she isn't the one, but it's possible that William has not meet the one. I'm not psychic but I do get gut feelings. ; I actualy get readings myself and found one girl on the net that I have gone to for a number of years that is amazingly acurate for me. So I would have to say that I find some to be accurate and some to be not. \nIf anyone wants to try out the girl I go to you wont be dissapointed.\nhere is the link. \nhttp://weRlive.com/vippath.asp?hnumber=284092\nShe has great feedback that backs up my claims dont take me on my word. and she has been reading on the top sites on the net for years.\nbut as for Prince william only time will tell how true his predictions are, I can only speak for mine.",5000
2,"How easy is it to insert a tampon for the very first time? ; I imagine it would help if you were already masturbating so that you were familiar with your anatomy. ; I think I know why you're asking. Maybe you have a young girlfriend and you're asking for her.\n\nI am talking now of personal experience.\n\nI started masturbating as a child, many years before my period started. When I got my period, I discoverd it while I was masturbating....\n.... that was very disgusting....\nJust as a proof that many girls also masturbate at a young age.\n\nIf a girl masturbates, she knows her body better than a girl that doesn't. I heard many questions like ""where to put the tampon"" - this is just weird. I also just read a question about that here.... and I answered this girl that she should masturbate to learn more about her body.\n\nBut really, using a tampon has nothing to do with masturbation itself. Using a tampon has in general no pleasing factor. It's not really great to use tampons, you just have to.\n\nThe first time, it could hurt a little, but the girl should carefully read the instructions in the box of the tampons.\nThen it will be alright.",5005

9,"How reliable are dogs when they are used in criminal cases? ; I would assume there is some sort of standard....ie a scientific tests of some sort to establish credibilty and reliablity....of both the dog, the handler and the trainer....but is that really an exact science?...wouldn't that allow for a great margin of error?\n\nI have seen dogs go both ways.....do poorly on a case....and ones that have ""found"" the intended target..or whatever the situation may be. I am not talking about drug sniffing dogs.\n\nTwo cases I am thinking of are the Jessica Lunsford(sp) case in FLA...where the dog didnt locate her body in the shallow grave.....and the Scott Peterson case...where the dog handler was allowed to testify( he(the dog..lol) sniffed at the end of the dock...denoting that she was in the water).\n\n\nShould dogs be allowed to be used(sniffing) in criminal cases? Not as a tool or method for law enforcement but should they be able to ""testify"" in court....and of course I don't mean the dog  but the handler re: testimony? ; The actual use of a dog is quite exact. The problem you run into are the training techniques and the fact that certain dogs (and handlers) should not pass the training certs they are required to. Many of the 'good dogs' are almost 100% right and even when they alert, and there is nothing there, there HAS been something there in the past. For example drug and 'people' dogs, those used to find illegal aliens on the border. Many times they will alert to an area and no one or no dope is found. If the dog is good, then you can practically guaruntee that there was something there in the past. Also take for example that bloodhounds are the only dog that can be used for a track and their nose is the only one you can make a warrantless entry. Yet the bloodhounds I worked with couldnt find a bisquit.\nRef testimony: if the dog has an excellent history, I believe that what they alert to should be used in court. Obviously not as the only thing, but is an extremely good indication that something was illegal, there, not right etc. If the dog has a record of mis-alerts then I believe that the 'testimony' of the dog should not be used. Once again, here lies the problem. Its difficult to prove when a dog is mediocre as his failures are rarely reported on, only his successes.",5027

I remember watching the movie I am asking about and I know it wasn't a nightmare movie he was real in this movie the whole time.

5,"whats a good way to improve your time  in swimming ? ; in a meet during the 50 yrd. backsroke and freestyle  how do you improve your time?   especially if your really slow  i wont say how slow.......... ; Be encouraged that if you seriously set a goal to improve your time, then you will!  These are some steps to take along the way.  First, work with experienced and trustworthy tutors to learn swim techniques.  Ask several coaches to watch you swim and accept their corrections and suggestions. Practice what works for you and discard what doesn't.  If possible, select one coach to encourage you, time you, spur you on.  Second, borrow books from the library about swimming, watch video tapes, and you will discover a lot.  Read Total Immersion material. You will be fascinated with your reading.  Also, research your topic on line to find articles about backstroke and freestyle.   Third, working your fast twitch muscles will help you improve time.  As you improve in technique, then -- and only then --practice harder and faster swims each time you get in the water.  Watch the clock and try to improve each week.  Most importantly, have patience with yourself and be less self-critical.  Let go of negative thoughts and stay positive.  A great deal of swimming is mental activity so stay positive.    As you practice new techniques to improve your strokes, you will find yourself improving, getting a better feel for the water.  In the end, you might surprise yourself with an improved attitude and an incredible mind-set about life.",5130

9,"Should Incest be Legalized? ; This one is for all of the fans of gay-marriage.\n\nShould incest between consenting adults who can no longer bear children be legal?  Why or why not? ; Rene underscores the point Bananaman is trying to make here. She finds incest ""disgusting"" and uses that as an argument to support the illegality of incestuous relationships.  What ""disgusts"" one person may not another and thus it can be seen as somewhat hypocritical to support gay marriage but not incestuous marriage which many also find disgusting.\n\nRemember “disgusting” just means tending to repel or sicken people and many supporters of gay marriage are at least somewhat disgusted by many of the sexual acts homosexual couples must engage in (for obvious reasons).  They support gay marriage out of a belief for personal liberty which I find admirable.  But like Bananaman points out, why not extend the same personal liberties for incestuous couples?\n\nChicagoParty points out a better reason in that major birth defects can result from genetic deficiencies caused by intrafamilial intercourse. I personally, like many others, think that it’s unfair to handicap your children in such a profound way.  \n\nBut Banana is making a valid point.\n\n---\n\nOn another note the way we are progressing socially I wouldn't be surprised if incest loses some of it's social sting in the next 30-50 years. I don't think it's something to get worked up over. In the end social deviancy has always existed and accepting it culturally isn’t going to change how I live my life.\n\nRegards,\n\nArmus",5137

Was the doctor wrong? ; You can have symptoms of depression with SAD even in summer months if it is overcast.  People who live in areas of the world that only get sun for limited times during the day or year can sometimes experience the symptoms year round.

If your urine becomes lighter, then it's probable that you simply didn't have enough clear fluid in your system.\n\nIf the urine remains dark amber, and/or if you have other symptoms, like pain or a burning sensation when you urinate, pain or tightness in your stomach, aches in your back where your kidneys are located, etc., you should see a doctor.\n\nDark amber urine may also mean you have some blood in your urine.

I catagorised it under women's health but this time will try politics.  I dont believe I can get in trouble with yahoo by using the health term menstrual cycle.  Briefly she made two bad decisions.  One was appointing a man who has had problems with honesty in the past and the second is taking off the Congressional oversight intelligence committe a highly qualified woman and putting on a man who was fired as a judge for giving police information to criminals.  Could she have had severe menstrual symptoms that caused her to make these decisions.  I don't have a big problem with that just get a little fussy but no major cramps, dissiness etc.  My mom usually gives me more space during those times and is understanding.  The difference is Im not making major policy decisions effecting our country. ; Huff HUFF HUFF! What do you mean you did not get one answer?  I gave you a most excellent answer, enlightened and to the point, and best of all, made in USA.\n\nTHE FOLLOWING IS AN ANSWER:\n\nI think this, ahem, natural process can make women really crabby, and all you'd need is to have Nancy Pelosi doubled over in knots and then give her the slightest provocation and she'd go off like Michael Richards.  This could be a real problem if we had a woman president because all North Korea would have to do is to fire off a missile and if it happened to be that time of the month for her then she'd just up and nuke them. This is why I think that if we had a woman president there would be a new war every month.  She might be going through menopause which could mean the end of life on earth as we know it and might explain all her bad decisions.\n\nTHE PRECEDING WAS AN ANSWER.",5277

Today for the first time I noticed soreness around the injection area and moving toward my lower back.  I'm puzzled why I did not experience soreness before today, and I'm concerned that I may have an infection or abscess.  How do I tell and what are the treatment options? ; I probably shouldn't be advising you about this, but anyway....... Steroids are oil-based, so they will often form a lump when injected (especially if you use the same location all the time).

The 6800XT has GDDR3 memory MOST of the other cards with the AGP interface have GDDR2 memory which is slower.  256MB of GDDR3 memory will outperform 512MB of GDDR2 memory, every time.

As for convincing him to stop, the answer is different for everyone. He will need to want to stop for himself, first, for this is the only effective reason. I went to a councelor about it, and that helped me incredibly.

Freedom from being controled by the addiction.\n\nMy answer to your question is this. Councelors spend their lives learning about this sort of thing. You should find a friend who can recommend a trustworthy councelor for you. Go and see them and explain your delima. Not only will they help you to feel better, they will explain all the things you can do for this person. I promise, this would be your best option.

This ""chrisma"" is given to us at the time we're saved to show we're approved priests.  This annointing includes the giving of spiritual gifts.

It is really unknown what our time is capable of doing. But if we are able to go back in time, it will be a big mistake. A time parodox will happen, and that is not good at all. Say your Mom gets in a wreck and dies, so you build a time machine so that you can go back in time and save her. Well, if you do go back in time and save her, then you would have never had to have built the time machine to save her. She would have never died, so you would not spend your time building the time machine. But if you never had built the time machine then she would have died. If she died, you would have built the time machine to save her, and if you saved her, you would have never had to build the time machine. Thus, a time parodox. Another scenerio, which is broght up in the short story ""A Sound of Thunder"", is that if you go back in time to the age of the Dinosaurs and step on a bug, then all of those bugs children will never be born (and a few billion years down the road, that will be a HUGE decrease in that bug population. If there is a big decrease in that population, then a lot of the animals that survive off of those bugs will die. If those larger animals die, then the animals that eat those animals will die. Eventually, there is not going to be much life on Earth. Either that, or the species will evolve to try to adapt to the decrease in the animal population. They might resort to eating plants. If all of the animals eat only plants, most of the forests would be destroyed, if the forests are destroyed, then there will be less oxygen, then all the animals will die and maybe a new species will arise that can survive in a oxygen lacking environment. See all of the things that can happen if you step on a bug. So if a scientist comes up to you and says ""Do you want to travel back in time?"" Say yes, go over to the machine and either pee on it or hit it with a sledge hammer to destroy it. Then tell them to never build a time machine because you could mess up the Earth.",5545

On the news lately all I hear about are lawsuites, harsh comments be expressed toward our nation, religion, immigration, and many who expect the government to do everything for them, after accusing them of corruption, and just blame them for everything. I have seen much of this, and our government, and the people of America are falling apart, due to all this. If the government set stricter laws that the citizens of america would accept, would it be a benefit to the country if laws were made stricter to those who are not concerned about the welfare of our country?what is your opinion? ; I do not think it is the freedoms that have weakened our country (assuming it IS weakened).  I believe it is the trend toward intolerance that would be having that affect.\n\nOur greatest strength for over 200 years is that we are all a mishmosh of ideas, nationalities, faiths and opinions.  Our ability to allow for another opinion, even one we disagree with and do everything we can to oppose, has always made us strong.

We are now getting to the idea that only one way is the right way and to even THINK otherwise is evil.\n\nThis is showing in the lawsuits (where I WILL agree we need laws limiting them - and none too soon).

Anyone can help me with this, about 200 words because I have only few minutes to talk about this. Thank you very much. ; Try to download the free Visual C# Express 2005 from Microsoft and also check the online documentation of MSDN. \n\nThese are the excerpt from the documentation:\n\n""C# Language\nC# syntax is highly expressive, yet with less than 90 keywords, it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Developers who know any of these languages are typically able to begin working productively in C# within a very short time. C# syntax simplifies many of the complexities of C++ while providing powerful features such as nullable value types, enumerations, delegates, anonymous methods and direct memory access, which are not found in Java. C# also supports generic methods and types, which provide increased type safety and performance, and iterators, which enable implementers of collection classes to define custom iteration behaviors that are simple to use by client code.\n\nAs an object-oriented language, C# supports the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism. All variables and methods, including the Main method, the application's entry point, are encapsulated within class definitions. A class may inherit directly from one parent class, but it may implement any number of interfaces. Methods that override virtual methods in a parent class require the override keyword as a way to avoid accidental redefinition. In C#, a struct is like a lightweight class; it is a stack-allocated type that can implement interfaces but does not support inheritance.\n\nIn addition to these basic object-oriented principles, C# facilitates the development of software components through several innovative language constructs, including:\n\nEncapsulated method signatures called delegates, which enable type-safe event notifications.\n\nProperties, which serve as accessors for private member variables. \n\nAttributes, which provide declarative metadata about types at run time. \n\nInline XML documentation comments.\n\nIf you need to interact with other Windows software such as COM objects or native Win32 DLLs, you can do this in C# through a process called ""Interop.""

1,"number of chromatids per chromosome during cell cycle? ; I need to know how many chromatids per chromosome there are for the stages G1, S, G2, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.\n\nI think its \nG1=1, \nS=2, \nG2=2, \nprophase=2, \nmetaphase=2,\nanaphase=1\ntelophase=2\n\nAm I correct in my thinking or do I have the whole thing messed up or just some of it? ; In G1, there are 46 chromosomes, EACH CONSISTING OF A SINGLE CHROMATID.  You will have two copies of chromosome one (one from mom, the other from dad), two copies of chromosome two, etc.  These pairs are called homologues.  Consequently there are 23 homologous chromosomes in G1 and, again, there is one chromatid per chromosome in this phase.  This gives a total of 46 chromosomes.  You should know that each chromosome is decondensed (not coiled up) at this time. \n\nS phase is the synthesis or replication phase of the cell cycle.  After S phase is complete, the definition of a chromosome changes.  It is now a ""replicated chromosome"" that consists of 2 chromatids (some texts describe these as ""sister chromatids"").  Again, the total number of chromosomes is 46; however, because of the definition change of the S-phase chromosome, each chromosome how includes twice as much DNA due to replication.  After S phase there are two chromatids per chromosome.  These chromosomes are decondensed.\n\nIn G2, there are 46 chromosomes:  2 chromatids per chromosome, decondensed, with the chromosomes existing in homologous pairs.\n\nIn prophase of mitosis, the chromosomes condense to facilitate easy separation into the daughter cells.  Here there are still 2 chromatids per chromosome.\n\nIn metaphase, there are STILL 2 chromatids per chromosome, all smartly arranged at the ""equator"" of the cell, the metaphase plate.\n\nIn anaphase, the replicated chromosomes (i.e., the ""sister chromatids"") are pulled apart.  At the point that they are separated, the definition of a chromosome changes AGAIN, BACK to a single chromatid.  Each daughter cell will receive 46 of these single chromatids and, therefore, will have 46 chromosomes in 23 homologous pairs.  The chromosomes are still condensed at this point.\n\nIn telophase, the chromosome situation is exactly the same.  23 homologous PAIRS of chromosomes (46 single chromatids).  The difference here is that the chromosomes are now decondensing.\n\nSummary:  the number of chromatids per chromosome\n\nG1-1\nafter S- 2\nG2-2\nprophase-2\nmetaphase-2\nlate anaphase-1\ntelophase-1",5666

Bush's ""Sanctity of Marriage"" gay marriage constitutional ban. \nGeorge W. Bush's marital problems have just taken another turn for the worse. Apparently, Mr. Bush has not only engaged in an extra-marital affair with a member of the opposite sex who is also a senior member of his Cabinet, but also a member of the same sex. WMR received the following  release this morning from Leola McConnell, Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada (who has been endorsed by WMR). McConnell is a one-time professional dominatrix.\n""President Bush's speech to the nation Monday. If he doesn't say he's a gay American or at the least a bisexual one then he shouldn't be making one at all. And the notion that it would be in regards to writing bigotry into our nation's Constitution is reprehensible. Too bad it isn't me doing the rebuttal because in 1984, I watched him perform (with the enthusiasm of homosexual male who had done this many times before) a homosexual act on another man, namely Victor Ashe. Victor Ashe is the current Ambassador to the nation of Poland who should also come out like former Governor McGreevey of New Jersey and admit to being a gay American. Other homo-erotic acts were also performed by then private citizen George Bush because I performed one of them on him personally. \n\nI am the woman this website (bushssecretlifein84.tripod.com) speaks of that has been posted on the net nearly two years now. None of this would be the business of anyone but President Bush's little ruse to save his failed presidency by using DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act] to divide Americans one from the other has to be exposed as the act of a desperate closeted homosexual man. The only crime in being GLBT is in the hiding. The President needs to come clean with the American people about his own past sexual behavior before he tries to besmirch the humanity of people in search of sincerely committing to the same bonds of matrimony he's afforded. He violated his own vows of monogamy having a homosexual affair with a long time family friend of whom his wife had no knowledge. His hypocrisy seems to know no bounds. \n\nI had planned to run for governor of Nevada without going into any of this but his planned nationally televised address to the nation makes it necessary for me to address his attempt at division in as public a way as he picked to try this Bushification of reality regarding same sex marriages.\n\nSincerely,\nLeola McConnell\nLiberal Democratic candidate for Governor of Nevada\n --------------------------------------\nNow, aint this special!?",5819

Hubble first described this back in 1925 that the redshift or recession velocity of a galaxy is proportional to the distance in relationship with the viewer.

Try to find out, what's the reason that your hemorrhoids have developed in the first place - constipation, genetical predisposition, liver disease, overweight, pregnancy, too much pressure in the lower part due to heavy lifting, overweight, prolonged sitting. Once you find the reason take proper measures e.g. overweight - lose weight, prolonged sitting - make short breaks, constipation - take care of your bowel movement and make it soft with high fiber diet, drink wheat grass juice, or juice of prune. For genetical predisposition or liver disease contact your doctor.\nIn each case juice of white radish also helps to cure hemorrhoids and/or prevent them from re-appearing.",5966

1,"Why do rabbits have white tails? ; Wild rabbits are really well camouflaged - until they start running, when their little white tails start bobbing - just shouting ""chase me, I'm here"". Is this an evolutionary oversight, or is there a reason behind it? ; One theory is that when feeding in the dusk, rabbits run to their burrows on the least alarm, and that it would be very important for those who were furthest off, and especially for the young, to be able to follow the others without any hesitation in a straight line. The upturned white tail thus serves as a useful guide.",5993
9,"In what year were cannons invented? ; and when did they reach each contient? ; A cannon is any large tubular firearm designed to fire a heavy projectile over a considerable distance. The term can apply to a modern day rifled machine gun with a calibre of 20 mm or more (see autocannon).\n\nCannon also refers to a large, smooth-bored, muzzle-loading gun used before the advent of breech-loading, rifled guns firing explosive shells. Although a variety of such guns are commonly referred to as ""cannon"", the term specifically refers to a gun designed to fire a 42 lb shot as opposed to a ""Demi-cannon"" (32 lb), Culverin (18 lb) or Demi-culverin (9 lb). ""Cannon"" derives from the Latin canna—a tube. Bombard was earlier used for ""cannon"", but from the early 15th century came to refer only to the largest weapons. ""Cannon"" serves both as the singular and plural of the noun.",5994

""When she was young she could eat everything and not gain weight"" This demonstrates there is not much wrong with her genetically as she spent many years eating normally. The reason she cannot stop herself now is as a result of an Anxiety that is similar to the feeling of hunger that she cannot relieve in other ways so she takes the message of hunger and tries to relieve that.

After all, how could there be a snow-capped peak just three degrees south of the equator? But German-speaking explorers were the first Europeans to ever see and climb Kilimanjaro—and establish the mountain's existence.\nKilimanjaro is also the world's highest mountain that can be climbed by hiking (walking), but the lower, more jagged Mawensi volcanic peak (17,564 ft) was not climbed until 1912 and requires mountaineering experience.",6117

Do you believe you too know about your children much more than your children know about themselves? Why? Help please!!! ; I believe she's alluding to the importance of self-introspection. Ralph Waldo Emerson writes some great stuff about this concept(read his ""The American Scholar"").

It was interesting to see that almost everyone spoke both English and Spanish, and nearly all were hispanic. They didnt have alot of radio stations to choose from and I ended up having to listen to Republican talk radio. The guy on said that he was against immigration and that many illegals could easily be caught by their hispanic last names. So i ask:\nSince most people in Laredo are hispanic, yet citizens of the US, how could this Republican's statement be true....is Laredo the only city like this?

9,"Can a bill go directly from the GOP controlled House to the President and skip the Senate? ; No, I don't think so, nice try.\n""I believe that it's law,"" said House Majority Whip Roy Blunt, R-Mo.\nNot so, says Zeigler, a Republican activist.\n""An eighth-grader in civics class knows that a bill cannot become law unless the identical bill passes the House and Senate and is signed by the president,"" Zeigler said.\nThe bill, which Bush signed Feb. 8, tightens rules for Medicaid nursing home eligibility to make it more difficult for those who have transferred their assets to their families or to charities to qualify for Medicaid.\nZeigler, who advises the elderly on eligibility for nursing home care under the Medicaid program for the poor and disabled, filed suit Monday in federal court in Mobile, Ala., naming Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as a defendant. Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller declined comment on the case.\nHouse Democrats, accusing GOP leaders of abusing the legislative process, have asked for another vote. On the last vote Feb. 1, the bill passed by the narrowest of margins, 216-214.\nThere is ample evidence to support the fact that Neocons attack Women, the poor and the elderly at every chance. ; A Bill is introduced in one House or another, if it passes it goes on to the other House, where they either pass the same version or more likely their own version of the Bill.  As both houses have to pass the same version of the same legislation it goes into committee of members of both house's who try to work out a compromise bill.  This is usually where all sorts of things get added to the bill that may have nothing to do with the bill in order to get both sides to agree on the bill.  At this point it goes before both houses again to be passed, if both houses pass the same version of the same bill it goes on to the President, however if any changes have been made between the two houses it goes to committee again.  This is how many pet project's or as it is called Pork Barrel Spending is created.  It is the same thing as the President spoke of as Earmarking in his State of the Union Address.

9,"Parrot talk!  Who taught some- that Americans won't do menial labor? ; Where does this idea come from? Many are maids, farm workers, construction, lawn-its not just the people from Mexico. A guest work pass is fine if companies need more. It would would not drain our system (Aid, schools,housing on them)We need to help the people in our own nation-who need Health-food-housing- its millions (look on web).It seems many do not care about them-so they want them to suffer because of aid to others-what kind of Justice is that? And that excuse is very old. Everyone feels for the poor-but we don't trample on others-so others can get more. Hello- there is not enough money for everyone-it is not an endless pot. If those who want to help others-start a fund. I am not going to see others hurt in your so called humanity efforts that effect other here already. And it does effect them! Educate yourself and quit repeating mindless words. ; The illegal Mexican immigrants are invading this country trying to take it over. It's encouraged by Mexico and the American businesses who use them for cheap labor. Their loyalty is to Mexico. They proved that during one of the first rallies when they took down the American flag, hung up the Mexican flag, and then hung the American flag upside down underneath it. THAT is how they feel about America. \n\nhttp://michellemalkin.com/archives/004869.htm\n\nThen the people who want to appease them pull out the excuses about how people who are not even alive now, and haven't been for hundreds of years, 'stole' the land from the American Indians. Even American politicians are carrying out this traitorous attack on our sovereignty! If this keeps up, the United States of America will become a 3rd world country, just like Mexico! Mexico's problems are not the fault of Americans, but they are becoming our problems because the Mexicans are invading us and bringing their problems with them.\n\nThe illegals make up about 5 % of the work force. The unemployment rate is about 4.5%. Keep in mind that the unemployment rate does NOT represent everyone who is unemployed. It only counts those who are collecting unemployment. Everyone else's plight is ignored. The unemployment rate if everyone was counted would be tremendous. We do NOT have a shortage of labor, we have a large surplus. The more illegals that come in and take our jobs at minimum wage or less (often less) puts more and more Americans out of a job. Most of these Americans are never counted in the unemployment rate if they do not manage to get unemployment benefits. Unemployment benefits are hard to receive.\n\nIllegals draw welfare by stealing people's social security numbers and identities. That means there are a lot of people being directly hurt by these people as well. Innocent people are having their credit ratings ruined, having IRS problems, and social security problems. If someone who has had their social security number stolen gets married, if either spouse dies or become disabled then they can be denied their benefits. \n\nMy family moved to the US before WWII. Those of my family that didn't make it over got killed by the death camps. Our family assimilated to the American culture. We didn't expect the Americans to change to suit us. The illegal immigrants from Mexico are not civilized like that.\n\nThey not only changed the National Anthem to Spanish, they changed the words. They already burn our flag and hang our flag upside down. They waved the Mexican flag during a lot of their protests. Some schools have stopped hanging the American flag and forbidden students from wearing clothes with any part of the American flag on their clothing all to keep from offending the Mexicans. It's nothing short of an attack of our country, not only by the illegal aliens, but those who seek to appease them. \n\nI am tired of the stereotype that Americans wouldn't do the work that illegals do. Illegals do all kinds of jobs for less than minimum wage which drives the wages down for U.S. citizens. Construction jobs are an example. There are lots of illegals doing construction jobs that Americans used to do because the companies can keep more of the profits if they pay less for the workers. All that does is make companies wealthier and Americans poorer. Illegals are stealing jobs that Americans have done for years. \n\n""Mexico is waging war on the U.S. through mass immigration illegal and legal, through the assertion of Mexican national claims over the U.S., and through the subversion of its laws and sovereignty, all having the common end of bringing the southwestern part of the U.S. under the control of the expanding Mexican nation, and of increasing Mexico’s political and cultural influence over the U.S. as a whole. \n\n \nCultural imperialism\n\n \n\nWe experience Mexico’s assault on our country incrementally—as a series of mini-crises, ea",6173

6,"What is a typical advertising budget for companies shown as a percentage of sales? ; what do companies spend on advertising?  What is the percentage of sales that a consumer electronics company spends on advertising? How are advertising budgets decided? ; This is a very broad scoping question.  Each specific industry will spend a different percentage of gross revenue on advertising.  If a company has good exposure to a physical location, lets say they are located on a busy street and they are a retailer, they don't need a large budget for advertising.  Furthermore, product specific companies will fluxuate advertising costs based on where they are in the product life cycle (Educational advertising costs may be larger than other costs).  \n\nThere are two primary ways that a company can decide budgets for advertising; top-down and bottom-up.  Imagine upper management on top and marketers on bottom.  In a bottom up situation, the marketers will design the budget and propose it to management.  In a top-down approach, the management will give marketers a budget cap.  From here, it gets more intricate and complex as to how actual figures are determined, but they are mainly determined by an analysis of your target market and the eficacy of different advertising channels in communicating the marketing message to said audiences.\n\nOverall, advertising is normally one of the largest expenditures that a company makes.  Consumer electronics companies like Sony and Panasonic spend a large amount on marketing.  Advertising is a part of marketing and represents a large portion of the marketing budget.  But, again, it all depends on the specific company and its current exposure and what point on the PLC you are talking about.

1,"Do you work for a company that fabricates pressure vessels or heat exchangers? ; I just got a job with one.  Please tell me all you know about it, including the terminology of all the fabrication parts you work with.  These are the terms I already know:  nuts, bults, rods, flanges, gaskets, blind flanges . . . . that's about it.   Please tell me the names of other parts. ; The parts and fabrication of  both pressure vessels and heat exchangers depends on the medium being stored or cooled. It will also depend on the pressure handled by these components.\n Pressure vessels are not much more than a storage tank and can be fabricated by welding two halfs together with a coupling welded at one end or by welding end caps to a cylinder. They can then be anneald or cryogenicly treated depending on their intended use.Some vessels are expanded after welding in a bath of liquid nitrogen. They are first cooled and then subjected to high internal pressure.This process is to stress relieve an object which will be subjected to an extreem thermal envirorment. Once expanded the temperature is raised at a specific rate untill room temperature is acheaved. Stress relieving can also be done in an oven. In this case the object will be raised in temp, held for a specific time and then cooled at about one degree F untill back at room temperature.\n Some pressure vessels called Acumulators are used to maintain pressure rather than store excess fluid or gas. In this case a blader is built into the vessel and one side is charged to whatever you need. An example of this is the expansion tank in a hydronic heating system.\n  Heat exchangers can be for liquid or gas. In a liquid system either heated or cooled liquid is pumped through the shell while the fluid passes through tubes which are bathed by this liquid.Tubes are welded or brazed to plates which are in turn welde or brazed inside the shell end caps are bolted to the flanges of the shell with couplings for the pipeing. \nHeat exchangers can also be used to convey heat to a room such as a radiator or be air cooled as in an automobile radiator.\n Gas type heat exchangers are used in heating and convey hot flue gasses around which cooler air is passed. This type of design is welded or brazed from stamped sheet metal. I have also seen high volume hot air units in which the shell has an electric heater that the air is passed through. I've only worked with this type once and don't know much about it's manufacture.",6241

6,"I think this government grant program is worth the time? ; but do you?\n  http://www.swapselltrade.com/govgrants.htm ; It is hard to find grants to start a business. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for a for-profit business. And yes, grants mean PAPERWORK - lots and lots of it, that is why a cottage industry of grant writers was born.\n\nNonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nEven if you buy books on ""how to get grants"" or list that supposedly has information on grants -- all of them are mere rehash of what CFDA has, albeit packaged differently. But still the info is the same - hardly any grants for starting a for profit business.\n\nEven SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/expanding/grants.html... \n\n""The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.""\n\nMost of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program \n\nGrants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs \n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs.",6246

9,"Why is there no talk by the newly elected Democrats to reopen a 9/11 investigation? ; There are so may questions surrounding the official 9/11 story that I wonder why the newly elected Democrats are not promising to reopen the investigation. From the video tapes the FBI confiscated from the Sheraton Inn, the gas station and the Virgina DOT cameras that filmed the 911 Pentagon attack, that could clear all the Conspiracy up, to the fact that WTC Bldg 7 fell for NO REASON, one would think that any ELECTED OFFICIAL that was NOT a TRAITOR, would be bound by the laws of NATURAL DECENCY to reopen the 911 investigation.\n\nAt least that is how I see it seeing as how we've started two wars since that have, in total, claimed at the very least, about 6,000 American lives and according to some reliable estimates, upwards of ONE MILLION Iraqi lives.\n\nI think it is prudent to reopen the 9/11 investigation and see those confiscated video tapes to see what exactly hit the Pentagon and then take it from there. ; I appreciate this question and I will rightly scold anyone who gives it a thumbs down. After many hours of careful reading and studying, I have concluded that to deny the unanswered questions of 9/11 makes you no different than those who have denied the Holocaust. \n\nThere are many anomalies surrounding 9/11 and the truth of the matter is that depsite the so-called investigation that took place, no one has been held accountable for the failures that occurred that day. Not one person has been fired for the deaths of 3000 people which could have been prevented. \n\nThink about it. If this were a corporation, heads would have rolled by now. People would have been brought up on charges for criminal negligence. WTC 7 collpased from fire alone. No plane hit it. This is the first time in the history of architecture that you have a skyscraper (a 47-story one at that!) falling from fire alone. \n\nIf you were a engineer, wouldn't you want to know the truth why a skyscraper collapsed from fire alone? \n\nIf you were a fire-marshall, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nIf you were an underwriter for an insurance company, wouldn't you want to know the truth? \n\nThe unexplained circumstances of the WTC 7 collapse was outright ignored, as were the other anomalies surrounding the collapse of the Twin Towers and the attack on the Pentagon. It was as if they had the conclusion set in stone before they gathered all the facts from that fateful day. \n\nIf you read David Ray Griffin's book, ""The New Pearl Harbor,"" it spells out in pure science, sequential logic,  and deductive reasoning the argument that 9/11 was preventable and furthermore, that the root cause of the attacks were essentially covered-up. \n\nThe 9/11 Commission has substantially proven themselves to be more interested in ignoring the more crucial questions. They didn't want to place any blame, except on the alleged hijackers. This was their documented goal from the beginning. They protected those in power who failed to protect us that day. It is undeniable and irrefutable. Standard Operating Procedure for such emergencies were not followed by NORAD, the FBI, the NSA, the FAA, or the CIA. \n\nMore and more people are joining the truth movement. These include engineers, firefighters, police officers, architects, physicists, and other scholars. The victims of 9/11 have also embraced them. \n\nBelow are some links to some films that will enlighten you on the subject. \n\nWarning: if you have your mind made up that the government holds no responsibility whatsoever and if you unconditionally defend those in power despite overwhelming evidence that proves otherwise, don't bother clicking below.

Pros:  working with books and seeing what was new before everyone else; seeing books that I never thought of while shelving; meeting new people while working there and having them recognize me everytime they came into the store; having (for the most part) really great co-workers\nCons:  Standing on your feet all day, getting papercuts when shelving (yes you are tempted to look through books and are allowed to as long as you get everything done lol), getting in the habit of straightening books like they have them in the store...I still find myself going into Barnes and Noble and if they aren't done like how I was trained, I find myself straightening them or putting them back where they belong lol, holiday rushes at the cash stand...talk about feeling pressured, shelving duties meant we had to be there at 7:30am before the store opened which was okay but some mornings that was really hard and you just wanted to sleep in.  I was sorry to have to leave but they cut out the shelving department at my store so I was let go.  If I hear of the store near me here in Atlanta hiring, I may try for a part-time job here as I loved it so much.

Ever noticed that add ons can be attached to that particular browser only. As well it uses ActiveX controls, whether you need it not. which allows your computer to be identified. Both Netscape and the latest versin of Firefox gives you the option to use ActiveX when it's actually needed.\nSecondly, I would not recommend AVG to anyone. It's crappy and useless. Iknow from having to deal with repairs on infected systems that ran AVG. I would recommend AntiVir Personal edition, whic 100% free, updates and all. http://www.free-av.com.\nThis is what Linux users use when compelled to run Windows.\nThe recommendation to use Spybot, I totally agree with, it is the only Spyware/Adware program that identifies and removes Trojans.\nFinally it appears that you are not running a firewall for something like this to have happened. Windows firewall if running on your system is quite effective. You need to ensure that it's on. If you are using a system that doesn't, I personally recommend the stand alone Firewall from Symantec, Norton Personal Firewall 2005. (You can get a free 90 day dwwnload) Will be enough for you for now. The 2005 edition includes an ad blocking software that is not in 2006 that would prevent you from clicking on things that you shouldn't. I hope this helps.\n\nFinally go to the Microsoft site and run an update. That should do it.\n\nAnd young man stop looking at porn, I'm pretty sure thats where it came from.\n\nAnd I wish some of you would read, he's 13 he can't afford to buy anything.",6430

She said she was rubbing the male G spot and said it's the same spot that gay men hit when they have sex together.  I've wondered for years if I was gay because of numerous other reasons and now I get something like this happening.  Am I gay? ; Haha. Someone discovered something new. Hey man, your wife is misinformed. And you, obviously have not thoroughly explored your body...till now. We all have played with ourselves. Though, some slightly more than others. There are lots of ways for a guy to have intense orgasms. Anyway, the media and the gay community is always perpetrating that a man who dresses well, who's too good looking and goes to the gym is gay. And that such men should stop pretending and come out. This hype causes these type of men to question themselves with questions like ""I like it when I/my gf/my wife plays with my anus so am I gay?"" or ""I do envy other males with better physique than mine so am I gay?""...etc. This is overblown. And it doubles as a strategy to confuse and turn the fashion conscious, good looking, gym going men, gay. Yes it works. There men who are ""recruited"" gays. Truth is there's always a reason a man becomes gay. No one is born gay. Anyway the percentage of hetero men is higher than our homo counterparts. Whatever it is, the numerous other reasons n questions that you have, can only be answered by yourself. Some men do experience this phase of self questioning. Some don't. If you like men, lust after men, wanna have sex with men, wanna develop relationships with men or marry or live together. Then you are gay. If you don't, then you're not. Having questions doesn't make you gay. Looking at other guys doesn't make you gay. The decisions and choices do. Simple.\n\nWell now that you've added the details, its certainly more complicated. ok so you've probably had a sort of a gay lifestyle back then. But think of the reality, which is now. Are you happy with your wife and marriage? What about children? do you have children? Do you love your wife? why did you marry her in the first place? think of all the moments that both of you shared. If its all good. Then ending the marriage would destroy her and your children (if you have any). Not ending the marriage, will mean that you're not being honest to your wife and yourself. Either way someone will get hut. It boils down to you. Yes, its really difficult. Think about it and weigh the situations. You could talk to your wife about the problem, maybe with a counsellor too.

PLEASE HELP? ; A system undergoes a process between two fixed states first in a reversible maner and then in an irreversible manner.  For which case is the entropy change greater? and WHY? ; It depends on exactly what you are after here. Is the intention to make the point that since entropy is a thermodynamic property of the system, if the entropy of state 1 is s1 and that of state 2 is s2, then the entropy difference is s2-s1, regardless of how one transits between the states? However, in any real process there is, if one considers both the system and the surroundings, always a net increase in entropy. Of course, reversible processes are ideal constructs. In this sense the irreversible process will have the higher entropy increase.",6521

His SED rate is still 120 after about 5 weeks. What is the therapeutic range everyone is talking about. Yes blood work is getting done to make sure his van levels are ok. Can not re-culture the site of infection. It was or is in his back, they will be taking out the staples tomorrow. So the wound will be closed up. I am just not sure what will determine when or if the infection is gone. He feels good no apparent sign of infection. Red cells are a little low, white cells are good. His iron is down. Any help please ; Sed Rate range differ depending on gender and age.  The best thing for you to do is talk to your doctor about your concerns. Wounds with mrsa that have closed are difficult to detect if the mrsa is gone.  I work in a facility and deal with mrsa from time to time. There are different types of mrsa. from the lungs to the urine. I asked one of our doctors about mrsa in the wound and how someone can tell if the mrsa is gone and she told me that there is no 100% way of knowing. Usually when the wound closes and the patient has been treated properly with antibiotic (usually vancomycin) it is considered to be treated. If the wound heals with no signs and symptoms of infection (no swelling or redness) then there is no infection.  She also told me that everyone has a small amount of mrsa in the body. It is the level of mrsa that the person needs treated.  If his red blood cell count is low and iron is down it might be good to have him on an iron deficiency otc med. He might be anemic.  The best advice I can give you is ask your family physician and also your surgical doctor of your concerns. This is also why they get paid.  I hope I helped you in some way.",6548

I ask because just to say I want to run a business is one thing and to actually do it is something else.\n\nSo I you do have the business experience and savvy and a couple of thousands to invest then check out and research the various types of franchises out there and see which one suits you. Entrepreneur magazine and others of this type should lead you in the right direction.\n\nIf you do not have ""running a business"" experience then let me recommend what a lot experts have been saying. Get into Network Marketing. The reasons being are:\n\n1- The Training - The good companies work with organization who will help you develop you knowledge in all aspects of your business and you before the product or service. This means time and energy will be invested on developing you and a person and business-owner vs pushing you to move products.  Not to say that you shouldn't be moving products, that's why you're in business. \n\n2- Developing a Network - In order to have a strong and prosperous business you need repeat business. These organizations of  business owners will help you in the developing strong networks so that your business keeps moving forward.\n\n3- Global Opportunities - No more do you have to limit your self to just you neighborhood  with the advent of the Internet you now have access to a global marketplace. The larger companies and organizations can help you in expanding you business into the international arena if the opportunity arises for you.\n\n4- Low Risk - Most companies have a low start-up investment\nwhich means that you can work it on a part-time level until you are making enough to go full-time. So you don't have to quit your job or quit school. Also the highly reputable ones have a money-back guarantee.\n\nPoints -\n1- You may of heard for people failing to succeed in this type of business most of it is attributed to  some people fail to treat it like a business. \n\n2-A business is a business and you won't get anything out of it if you don't put anything in it.\n\n3- As a very wealthy man once told me ""Check the fruit on the tree"". Be careful of who you take advice from, check the fruit on their tree. Are they where you want to be or are they even going in that direction. \n\n\nSo keep up in doing your research and the best is yet to come.\n\n\nMy recommendation is Quixtar. They're a 6-billion dollar company. I've dealt with some of the people before. Lovely people. What I like is that they have a wide variety of products and services to offer so a person is not limited to just one or two things. Also they also seem to be on the cutting edge of product technology. Let them help you get in contact with someone in your area who can help you.",6618

Why does that hurt but it doesn't hurt when you are in a bright room and turn the lights off???? ; You have rods and cones in your eyes.  Rods are for darkness and cones are for light.

6,"What is your opinion? ; I live an hour and a half away from work and have to commute every day (Monday - Friday).  It puts a lot of miles and wear and tear on my car, not to mention costs a lot, and takes a lot of time and energy.  I found a house twice as close to work that I am interested in purchasing.\n\nI live with my boyfriend.  I am 19 years old and he is 20 years old.  I have a bit of credit established and he does not at all.  If we are going to purchase this house any time soon (our lease goes up October 1st) it will have to be in my name since I have credit and he does not.\nMy idea is (if I can get pre-approved) that we should go ahead and get the house in my name and put the utilities in his name while he builds credit. Once he has credit built up and/or we are married, we will refinance to put the house in both of our names.\nHis idea is to wait to buy a house until he has established credit.  But in the meantime, it costs me a lot of time, money, and energy to work so far away.\n\nSuggestions? ; I will preface my answer by stating that I am a licensed Realtor® in the state of Arizona.\n\nIt sounds to me like you have your act together even for a person of your age. I commend you for your way of thinking.  \n\nPersonally if it was I and I could make the financing and the payments work I would buy now and start building some equity.  Between the amount you will pay down on the principal on your loan (it won’t be much at first) and the appreciation of the value of your property, you will be able to move into something higher in value in the future.  \n\nI don’t like to get into financing so much as I don’t have the training for it, if you find yourself a good Realtor® and/or lender. They will be able to guide you through the process of getting financing as well as finding the right home for you. \n\nGood luck in your search for your home\n\nP.S.: If your lease is up in October, you will need to get going on the process now, as it usually takes about a month to go through all of the inspections and closing.",6653

It makes it so that a state supreme court would not be able to declare marraige laws unconstitutional, thus sending it to the Supreme Court.  Would the republican advantage hold up there--justices often use the Constitution rather than party lines when making decisions, so it could open the issue to be challenged nationally rather than on the state level. ; Yes they will!\nHere's some logic.

A perfect fit (strap not too tight, no water leaks -- pereferable even when you laugh or grin) is the only real criteria.  Any mask sold by a reputable shop would fit the bill.\n\nFins -- you need to decide between full foot and open heel.  My preference is open heel (more versatile -- especially for shore diving) although some prefer the full foot.  Fit is also hugely important and if you are shore diving in cold water buy your booties first.  My preference is the Apollo bio fins although there are many excellent choices out there.\n\nIn terms of torch, I think that depends on your application.  I like the Ikelite PCA, the UK SL4 and the small UK pocket light.  These would work for tropical night diving.  Anything brighter will overpower the reef.\n\nFor cold water or cave, you probably need to amp up the power a tad bit and I would look at the more heavy duty rechargeables (including canister lights).\n\nI remain a fan of the Suunto Cobra dive computer but there are *many* other great options.  Start with gas type (nitrox or air only), integration (not air integrated, hose air integaration and hoseless air integration), features and budget and go from there.\n\nTons of choices with regualtors -- start with your budget and diving environement.

CIA agents (she was a analyst, not a female James Bond) are not allowed to use assets for private or poltical gains, as her husband was doing, ""outing"" her instead of a reprimand was not right, but better than ""silencing"". The U.S. Constitution does not guarrantee any rights to non-citizens, especially not ones plotting to attack this country or helping those that are. AND you have to show his actions are different not only from any predecessor in the White House, but democrats will be very careful not to impeach him for anything they might want to do themselves. Lying under oath in his depsotion in the Kathleen Willey/Gennifer Flowers sexual harassment suit about Monica Lewinski, and the dress surfaing to prove he lied under oath and thereby thwarted justice, was a criminal act they could PROVE. It was not to defend the country from terrorism, it was to defend Bubba's poor judgement and being arrogant enough to think he was untouchable by justice. Clinton bypassed Congress all the time with things like the ""Kyoto Treaty"" which since Bush was elected (YES he won, no matter how many times they recounted and punched chads out for Gore) has been called the ""Kyoto Accord"" because Clinton tried to enforce it without ratification of Congress, wait and see if democrats pass it, because it gives an unfair advantage to bigger polluters like China and India and gives money to undeveloped countries by allowing them to sell ""pollution credits"" to polluting ones, it penalized the USA more than anyone else, naturally they all want it.  Impeached means put under congressional review. Jim Carville, Al Franken and Bob Shrum are very effective political spinsters, they are not telling ""facts"" they are trying persuade undecided and reaffirm the left wing and democrats for political purposes, that is their job, what they say is not reality, it will not hold up in court .  Compared to things democrat Presidents have done in the past, you would have a hard time presenting your list in court, double standards for dems or reps only works in the media. Havn't you noticed the great concern for exposing Mark Foley or the  Valerie Plame matter can wait for years until an election is coming to be disclosed by the press? It is as much propaganda as anything you accuse Bush of spreading. Stick with facts, learn the history of each President, such as Lincoln, who did more to tamper with the balance of powers than anyone else before or since. The Katrina disaster began with a mayor who had been given billions in federal aid to develope a plan and repair floodwalls but had spent it on a lot of talk and studies and shoddy contractor repairs, that was not Bush's fault, maybe help should have got there sooner but New Orleans was not the only place impacted and both mayor and state governor declined help at first and even while critizing federal response later couldn't coordinate where they needed help, shelter, food supplies or law enforcement , local planning is the job of local officials, the feds will send in what they are asked for where it is needed, but they need to be told first. The locals have to ASK the Feds to come in, and have a plan for the response that fits the specific characteristics of their community. That is what your local taxdollar supported politicians are SUPPOSED to be doing in office. The sad thing is New Orleans  will be no better prepared if hit again tomorrow. It also proved the folly of sending money, aid and resources to tsunami relief in Indonesia and earthquake relief in Pakistan when we had our own disaster and could have used those supplies and donations right here at home.

6,"what is the relationship between interest rates and inflation? ; And what would be the implications for someone thinking about investing in Bonds? ; Interest rates and bond values move inversely. Think of a playground see-saw. Interest rates rise, and existing bond values fall. Inflation is something that has and will cause the federal reserve to raise short-term interest rates, which causes existing bond prices to fall. If you are investing in bonds for the income they generate (regular interest payments from the issuer), then you'll be OK. If you're investing in bonds with the intention of selling them later for a gain, you may not be successful. Of course, even the experts are really bad at predicting interest rate moves, so don't try to predict the future too much. If you buy individual bonds, pay attention to quality and consider building a bond ladder. If you are working with a smaller amount of cash, consider bond funds. Also, be sure to balance this investment with some equity (stock) investments to give you diversification. Good luck!",6852

If you're pissed off about illegal immigration, fine, do something about it: start fining companies that hire illegals huge fines, and the illegal job market will dry up. If you're worried that people don't understand English and won't be able to find a job, then offer free or low-cost English classes at various times and on various days in neighbordhoods where there are lots of immigrants.

So you're saying that in order to avoid becoming like the Chinese, who were able to employ xenophobic, intolerant troops to squelch liberty by killing the protesting Hans, whom they disliked, we should become more intolerant and xenophobic. Does that not seem a little contradictory to you? No, no, no, if we want to avoid the path of the Chinese, we need to encourage TOLERANCE not intolerance.\n\nTo Concerned: Actually, plenty of Americans do move to China and expect to be spoken to in English. My ex-husband travels there all the time and may be transferred there next year. He speaks very little Chinese. Luckily, all the business people in China speak English, so when he's around, they speak English. They would make him an immigrant who doesn't speak the language, dear.\n\nAre you aware that something like 50% of the business in non-English speaking countries in Europe is conducted in English? That's because they're intelligent enough to realize that it's in their best interest to be multilingual. The more languages you speak, the more business you can do with monolinguals, and the more money you make. It's the way of the whole freakin' world. Only citizens of the U.S. seem to think that they should never be forced to speak, or even listen to, another language.

2,"Does lithium have side effects? ; I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar, I was just curious.  I do suffer from depression, though. ; Lithium is like two different medications:  low doses are pretty easy to manage and produce few side effects.  High doses are tricky to manage, require close monitoring to stay safe, and can cause side effects which make people want to consider alternative treatments. \nBecause lithium is very similar to sodium (a ""salt""), taking lithium is like taking small salt tablets: it makes you thirsty. If you don’t drink more water than usual, you can have dry mouth. But when you do drink more, you will also urinate more. During the day this is usually not a problem, but some people have to get up at night to urinate when they did not need to before. Most people taking lithium will notice these effects somewhat, more so at higher doses.\n\nSome people can have nausea from lithium. The slow-release versions (Lithobid, Eskalith) are much less likely to cause this but can cost you more (not generic). After you have been taking lithium without nausea, becoming nauseous is a dangerous sign: your level may have become too high; get a lithium level if this does not get better, or if you get other lithium side effects.\n\nAs the dose and blood level go up, some other side effects can occur. Tremor (usually seen as shaky hands) is common. It can often be controlled with low doses of ""propanolol"", a blood pressure medication, if you and your doctor decide to continue lithium at this dose.\n\nWeight gain can occur with lithium. At first almost everyone will gain a few pounds as their body hangs on to more water (salt effect). Some people can continue to gain weight, though. This is much less of a problem with lithium than with valproate, both in how often it happens and how much weight is gained. Usually at this point we will switch medications, but some people can control the weight issue with regular exercise, wise eating, and avoiding alcohol entirely -- all good health habits anyway.\n\nSome people can have ""edema"", when your body has too much water, which shows up as ankle swelling or feeling ""bloated"". High doses can cause dry skin. At higher doses, loose stool or even diarrhea are frequently noted. Most of the other side effects you will see reported are uncommon.\n\nToo high a dose causes nausea, feeling very unsteady or ""wobbly"", slurring of speech, and confusion. If you notice these, call the on-call physician (she or he may arrange for a lithium blood test, and may lower your dose until the test shows what to do). It is dangerous to continue lithium if you have these side effects.\n\nAre there any serious side effects? (revised 5/05)\n\nVery high lithium levels, such as in overdose or continuing to take too much, can be fatal or cause kidney damage or other problems. Rarely a person can get very high levels when taking the right dose: this usually involves interactions with another medicine such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or blood pressure medications; or becoming severely dehydrated (losing fluids through vomiting and/or diarrhea is the most common; if you are sick, taking no lithium until you can drink--and keep!-- plenty of water can avoid this); or making a mistake with the dosing.\n\nLithium can decrease thyroid hormone in about one out of 10 people taking lithium (common). The gland is generally okay and recovers its usual function if lithium is stopped; the only exception to this may be in families where there are relatives with thyroid problems. Thyroid levels need to be checked at least once a year while on lithium, but several times in the first year. (Some references recommend routine checks twice a year, and a few even more often than that; this is a matter for discussion with your doctor). We usually check your lithium level as well at that time.\n\nLong-term lithium treatment, for a decade or two, can lead to a steady lowering in kidney function. The higher the dose, the greater will be this risk.Presne  It is routine to monitor kidney function while people are taking ",7026
1,"is this even possible to solve and if u can how? ; After the parade, the ppl on the float I was on shook hands with eachother. The Mayor came over and shook hands with only the people he knew. How many people did he know if there were 1625 handshakes altogether? ; The answer is that the mayor knew 29 people. And, although you didn't ask it, there were 57 people on the float.\n\nProof:\nGiven a group of n people, if everybody shakes hands once with every other member of the group then there will be (n(n-1))/2 handshakes in total.\n1. If there were 58 people on the float then there would have been ((58*57)/2)=1653 handshakes. But this is more than the total number of handshakes specified in the question so there must have been less than 58 people on the float.\n2. If there were 56 people on the float then there would have been ((56*55)/2)=1540 handshakes. This would mean that the mayor would have had to shake hands with 85 people in order for the total number of handshakes to equal 1625. But if there were only 56 people on the float then it is impossible for the mayor to shake hands 85 times (assuming he only shakes hands once with each person he knows). So there must be more than 56 people on the float.\n2. If there were 57 people on the float then there would have been ((57*56)/2)=1596 handshakes. If the mayor shakes hands with 29 of the 57 people on the float then there would have been 1596+29=1625 handshakes which is what you wanted to know.\n\nBTW: Next time vote for a female mayor - she might have been gracious enough to shake hands with everybody on the float :)",7033

Tunicate larvae (known as ""tadpole larvae"") _do_ have a notochord that supports their tails. \nThere are many genera and species of Tunicata; so if you do a Google Image search for either ""Tunicata"", ""Urochordata"" ""sea squirt"" or ""salp"" you'll get many good photographs.\nOn the other hand, the lancelets are much less diverse.

McKinley National Park in Alaska is the largest.  \n\nThe park was established as Mount McKinley National Park on February 26, 1917. Ironically, only a portion of Mount McKinley (not even including the summit) was within the original park boundary. The park was designated an international biosphere reserve in 1976. A separate Denali National Monument was proclaimed by Jimmy Carter on December 1, 1978.\n\nMount McKinley National Park, whose name had been subject to local criticism from the onset, and Denali National Monument were incorporated and established into Denali National Park and Preserve by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, December 2, 1980. At this time the Alaska Board of Geographic Names changed the name of the mountain back to ""Denali,"" even though the U.S. Board of Geographic Names maintains ""McKinley"". Alaskans tend to use ""Denali"" and rely on context to distinguish between the park and the mountain. The size of the national park is 4,740,906.73 acres (19,185.78 km²), of which 4,724,735.16 acres are federally owned. The national preserve is 1,334,200 acres (543.09 km²), of which 1,304,132 acres are federally owned. On December 2, 1980, a 2,146,580 acre Denali Wilderness was established within the park.",7211

It was never really discovered at any certain point in time but is known to have been part of civilization for thousands of years. Copper can be used for many things like bronze, watches, guns, pipes and even blue fire works. Copper is an essential nutrient to all higher plants and animals. In animals, it is found in the bloodstream. But large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deathly to organisms. It can also damage marine life from too much copper in water. The effect of this on fish and other creatures is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system. \n\nso many sentences dont sound right, how could i refrase them? ; Firstly, and most importantly, the word 'cuprum' isn't a word, at least not in latin or english, as far as I know, and I study latin. The word for copper in latin is '(h)enus'\n\nSecondly, you need to at least act sure about what you're saying. Write with conviction, even if you don't have any. Don't say ""never really discovered"", either it was or it wasn't. \n\nThirdly, you need punctuation. After ""certain point in time"" add a comma. You also need a comma after pipes in the phrase ""guns, pipes, and even blue fireworks."" Plus, fireworks is one word. You need to turn this from one paragraph into at least two different ones. \n\nRephrase the whole section with the two sentences ""in the bloodstream. But large amounts"" etc. That can be turned into better sentences, or one sentence. \n\nIn the sentence ""But large amounts"" after 'but' add an 'in' and get rid of the comma after amounts. Also, you should change deathly to deadly, or something else. The sentence should look like this:\n\n""But in large amounts copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisims.""\n\nor:\n\n""But, in large amounts, copper can be poisonous or even deadly to organisms.""\n\nYou might also want to add an adjective describing the organisms. \n\n\nWith the next sentence, add 'the' between 'in' and 'water'. \n\n\nRephrase the last setence too- it doesn't really make sense,\nPossibilities:\n\n""The effect of too much copper is damage to gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous systems of fish and other animals.""\n\nIt's too long. you should probably change it into two sentences. \n\n""This has many bad effects on land animals and fish. Some things that could happen are damage to the gills, liver, kidneys, and the nervous system."" \n\n\n\nI hope I helped.",7239

1,"About my last question regarding Maxwell Wheel.? ; In the Maxwell Wheel the angular velocity is w = v/r where r is the pole's radius and v is the translational velocity of the pole. But the v is also the tangential velocity of each point at the surface of the pole. So I understand that these velocities are equal (Why is that?) Furthermore, the angular velocity of the wheel is equal to the angular velocity of the pole, right? But in that case w=V/R, when V supposed to be the translational velocity of the wheel, don't it? But the translational velocities of the wheel and the pole are equal (they're falling together), so V=v,\nbut R!=r (not equal) so this is a paradox. Where am I wrong? ; ok.  call the downward translational velocity of the whole thing v.  this means that the tangential velocity at the edge of the poles (at the radius r) is equal to v.  the reason for this is that the strings are wound AROUND THE POLES, so this winding and the condition that the string has to unwrap for the thing to move, sets the angular velocity w = v/r.\n\nnow, if you look at the main wheel part, the angular velocity has to be equal to the angular velocity of the poles, since they are one solid piece.  however, as you note the radius of the wheel R > r.  so, the fact that v / r = w = V / R implies that V > v.  in other words, the motion of the outer edges of the wheel is faster than the motion of the outer edges of the rods.\n\ni think you are getting confused by saying that V is the translational velocity of the wheel.  it's not.  v is the translational velocity of the wheel, and of the rods.  the fact that the string is wound *around the rods* and not around the wheel sets the angular velocity of the whole apparatus equal to v/r.  V, the tangential velocity of the outer edges of the wheel, is much faster than the translational velocity.\n\nthat clear?",7320

I am unable to get it connected.  My coputer is a Dell.  The internet works when I plug it into the computer, but whenever I plug the internet cord to the router it doesn't get connectd.  Can you help?? ; Do you have a network card in your computer, or included with the existing computer board?  You need to run a host computer and have a network card in it, then it helps to control the router so you can contact other computers.\n\nI run my high-speed Internet connection into my cable router box, and then into my router.  I then run a wire to my PC Computer, and put a wireless card in my notebook.\n\nThis may help:\nThen you need a network card for each machine.  These cards talk with the router, and through it the modem, and then the Internet.  If you buy a wireless router then you will be paying more for that.  You will also need wireless cards to get the wireless benefit.  A wireless network is good if you have a portable machine (notebook) or if you don’t want to feed wires all over your house.  I use a wireless network and a wireless card for my notebook, and then I use a wire and wired card to connect my PC, since I don’t move it around.  I placed the modem near the PC to keep the wire short.  So it is possible to mix a wired connection and a wireless connection if you buy a wireless router.  I use a Linksys system with Linksys cards.  For the best performance I would make sure that my cards and router are from the same company.  (Linksys.com--routers:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_Content_C1&childpagename=US%2FLayout&cid=1115417027773&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper) (Linksys downloads:  http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?childpagename=US%2FLayout&packedargs=c%3DL_Content_C1%26cid%3D1115416835852%26site%3DUS&pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FvisitorWrapper)\n\nThick walls, like brick or concrete blocks, can block a wireless connection but the signal can still get through the walls (or the windows) and be received outside the house.  If this happens then it is possible for someone to hitch hike on your network and get free network access.  If you have a wireless router than it might be wise to get a firewall program to prevent people from entering your machine.  With a wired connection you system will be more secure, but you sacrifice the portability.  If you live in a residential area then few network hounds will try to steal your broadband connection.  I use Zone Alarm, which includes Cookie control and anti-spyware software.  It costs $40 per year (http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_zap.jsp;jsessionid=EuaAEjwOb8Z3Czd62TO1PO38fnQ0zqVFQd5S8NLKVTzzeq3rakI8!1792791820!-1062696904!7551!7552!NONE?dc=12bms&ctry=US&lang=en)\n\nInstall the cards in the computers.  With a notebook computer you can put the network card inside one of the slots on the computer, you don’t have to take it apart.  For a PC you have to take off the cover and plug in the new network card.\n\nThen go to Start > Settings > Control Panel > Network and Dial up Connections > Make new Connection.  Then follow the wizard.  If a driver is required then it will be included with the router, but usually they don’t need drivers.\n\nIf this is beginning to sound too complicated then you should get a computer pro to do it for you.  Best Buy offers the Geek Squad who will come out to your home to set things up, but it will cost more.  It is the best option though.  If you can bring both computers, cards, and router to a dealer then you can set the network up there, in their shop.  Then when you come home you can connect the network router to your modem.  This should work, but I can’t guarantee it.\n\nYou can buy the equipment on-line or buy it through eBay, but you will have to set up the Network yourself.  If you go to a computer store and purchase the equipment there then the salesman can give you advice on which system to buy and some hints on how to set it up.  It would be smart to either bring in your computers or to bring in a card from each machine to make sure that you get the proper network cards.  Most computer stores have an in-store-shop that can set up your network there.\n\nIf y",7406

During the interview  Mr. Tin was asked if the American antiwar movement was important to Hanoi's victory.  Mr. Tin responded ""It was essential to our strategy""  referring to the war being fought on two fronts, the Vietnam battlefield and back home in America through the antiwar movement on college campuses and in the city streets.  He further stated the North Vietnamese leadership listened to the American evening news broadcasts ""to follow the growth of the American antiwar movement."" \nPS:  U.S. Army retired",7434

I have the beginning, can you write the best ending? ; As they looked over the landscape, the sun shone through the clouds, glistening through the mist on the mountain's foothills.  \n\nThis place had over a thousand years of history.  Even through the dense jungle they could see the ruins of ancient temples and rock carvings.  Around them, the parrots were squwaking and the tropical flowers were beaded with morning dew.\n\nSomething was beckening them to venture deeper . . . ; it wasn't a voice, it was the sensations felt by millions of pilgrims to the site, drawing them to their God.  As they drew nearer, the sensations of peace deepened and the awe of the place grew tenfold.  Gazing up at the majestic ruins, they sensed the magnitude of the culture and peoples that built it.  As they wandered through the empty streets, they could hear the whispers of street vendors, of the carts being drawn and the animals bawling out their myriad of sounds.  They kept feeling the draw and the presence of something unseen, urging them deeper within the ruins.  \nAs they neared a building that was left virtually unscathed, they noticed the fine craftsmanship on the building and the magnitude of their emotions blossomed.  They approached it with baited breath and entered with reverence.  All around a central altar, benches circled the entire building.  Above the altar was a simple cross and a few words in the ancient tongue, etched in the stone below.  \nAfter struggling with the translations, they discovered the meaning.  It read simply, ""All who seek peace, may find it here"".  All of a sudden, they were filled with a glorious peace, that filled their entire being, and they knew that they had found the ancient God the natives had worshiped, and their own.",7444

Ifr you see me around smiling you ""NO"" I escaped ha ha.\n\nI know a little boy who just loves those guys who do try to explain the trinity.

Is that not very nice for a non-trinity believer to act ha ha\n\nAnother one of those thoughts from cjkeysjr@yahoo.com.ph ; THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE ""TRINITY""\n\n1st of all Jesus said: He pointed to God as the Source of his life, saying, “I live because of the Father.” According to the context, this meant that his life resulted from or was caused by his Father, even as the gaining of life by dying men would result from their faith in Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.—Joh 6:56, 57.\n\nJesus’ being called the “only-begotten Son” (Joh 1:14; 3:16, 18) does not mean that the other spirit creatures produced were not God’s sons, for they are called sons as well. (Ge 6:2, 4; Job 1:6) However, by virtue of his being the sole direct creation of his Father, the firstborn Son was unique, different from all others of God’s sons, all of whom were created or begotten by Jehovah through that firstborn Son. So “the Word” was Jehovah’s “only-begotten Son” in a particular sense,\n\nJesus is also “Mighty God” and “Eternal Father.” This does not mean that he usurps the authority and position of Jehovah, who is “God our Father.” (2 Corinthians 1:2) “He [Jesus] . . . gave no consideration to a seizure, namely, that he should be equal to God.” (Philippians 2:6) He is called Mighty God, not Almighty God. Jesus never thought of himself as God Almighty, for he spoke of his Father as “the only true God,” that is, the only God who should be worshiped. (John 17:3;\n\nDoes the Bible teach that all who are said to be part of the Trinity are eternal, none having a beginning?\n\nRev. 1:1; 3:14, RS: “The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him .  Why did God have to give Jesus the revelation, if Jesus is God?\n\nDoes the Bible teach that none of those who are said to be included in the Trinity is greater or less than another, that all are equal, that all are almighty? Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\n\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\n\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55 C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. \n\nA person who is really seeking to know the truth about God is not going to search the Bible hoping to find a text that he can construe as fitting what he already believes. He wants to know what God’s Word itself says. He may find some texts that he feels can be read in more than one way, but when these are compared with other Biblical statements on the same subject their meaning will become clear. It should be noted at the outset that most of the texts used as “proof” of the Trinity actually mention only two persons, not three; so even if the Trinitarian explanation of the texts were correct, these would not prove that the Bible teaches the Trinity.\n\nI COULD GO ON & ON WITH SCRIPTURES & EXPLANATIONS, BUT I THINK THIS ALREADY TO LONG FOR SOME PEOPLE.",7486

2,"what can a person take to control cough? ; Without taking a perscription drug. ; HI BARB\n\nHere is the cause and a remedy for you.\n\nCause \nThis is often caused by a stomach disorder that comes from overloading the system with food, wherein fermentation in the stomach causes phlegm. It may also be induced by inflammation in the bronchial tubes due to a neglected cold. Worms may be the cause. Many coughs are from a nervous condition, where coughing may eventually become habitual. Coughs are highly misunderstood. Usually a sore throat and coughing are caused by the sinuses draining the eustachian tubes, which is like pouring acid down the throat. A cough usually comes from a lowered vitality in the system from improper diet, loss of sleep, lack of exercise, and fresh air, improper breathing, poor elimination, or improper night clothing and bedding. \n\nHerbal Aids \n1. Acute coughs can often be relieved with a little honey and onion syrup. When it is the result of an old acute condition, clear out the morbid condition as rapidly as possible without causing irritation. In old cough conditions, comfrey with vervain or mullein are very good. The antispasmodic tincture is also excellent, and it is good to massage the chest area across the back with an antispasmodic tincture during attacks of spasms. Antispasmodic tincture may be used both internally and externally as a liniment on the throat. If this is due to a neglected cold, any of the diaphoretic herbs are excellent. To relieve the coughing spasms, use horehounds, comfrey, or a small amount of lobelia.

8,"Wedding+Distance=Crazy difficult. Ideas? ; My fiance and I are facing an issue with planning a wedding.\nWe live in the lower peninsula of Michigan (Cadillac, if you want to mapquest it or something). My friends and immediate family are local to us currently, as well as 2 hours to the south. His family and closest friends, however, are located in the upper peninsula, close to Wisconsin--about an 8 hour drive. The problem this presents is: Where should we have our wedding? If we did it in one place or the other, it would obviously be difficult for the side furthest away. The idea of doing it somewhere in the middle is possible, but I've been involved in planning two weddings, and I would not look forward to the added difficulty of planning one 3 or 4 hours from the venue.\n   Luckily, our engagement shall be long, so we're not tied to any sort of real deadline right now. Even so, we'd like to work out some solutions before it the date is dangerously close. Anyone who has been through a similar situation, or simply has some ideas? ; Not sure how much money you have budgeted for your wedding, but how about getting married at Castle Farms up in Charlevoix, MI.  I personally have never been there, but the pictures on the website are just beautiful.  You can have both the ceremony and the reception in the same place.  It's about 2 hours north of Cadillac.  You can even go on a virtual tour on the site.  Check it out: http://www.castlefarms.com/index.cfm\n\nIf you don't want to go with a full service place like this somewhere in the middle, I would just recommend having it locally.  It will make your life a whole lot easier.  Most everyone had to drive about 2 hours to get to my wedding.  I probably should have had it over in Muskegon/Grand Haven, where most of my family lives, but I just loved the place I found in Battle Creek.  Plus I live in Battle Creek and it just made my life easier.  \n\nIf you have it far away you will have to transport all of your supplies to that location.  Could be difficult and what if you forget something.  If I forgot something I only need to drive or have someone drive about 10-15 minutes to get it.  So I would think about that in your decision too.\n\nCongratulations! And Good Luck!",7592

In your heart you know that you want to be a Freemason.  Because the fraternity does not evangelize in any way we never ask anyone to become a Mason.  Every member has joined of his own freewill and has not been persuaded to become a member.  Your own Grandfather followed this rule and never asked you to join his lodge.\n\nSearch out the most respected members of your community and you will find that they are probably Freemasons.  Tell your desire to one of these men and he will secure for you a petition to the lodge.  A committee of inquiry will call on you at your home to make sure that your desires are true,  that you are a respected member of the community and worthy to become a Mason.   If the committee approves of you; the entire lodge will be notified and you must pass a unanimous ballot.  If any member of the lodge feels that you are unworthy; you will never become a member of the lodge as long as the objection exists.\n\nAs a member you will be part of the world's oldest and greatest fraternity.  You will find charitable needs and causes, education, fellowship, and friendship.  One of the greatest gifts a man can give to another is to help him become a Mason.

5,"How much less does golf ball fly in cold temperature?  7 iron 150 yards  in 80 F  vs 50 F? ; and the drive  250 yards  in 80  vs 50 F ? ; I could not find any information about distance.  I cut and paste some info I found.  I sent my Titleist Rep an e-mail asking the same question.  I will send you the info.  \n\nGolf balls travel farther when they are warm.\nSomewhat true. Colder temperatures do decrease a ball's velocity more than warm temperatures; although, the air temperature affects distance much more significantly than the temperature of the ball. The moral of the story is don't bother putting the ball in the oven before teeing off. Your pocket will do just fine. A two-piece ball will have a little faster initial velocity off the clubface in cold weather, so keep that in mind next time the frost is on the ground. \n\nThe weather report also influences which ball to choose. Warm conditions can expand balls, calling for players to use a higher compression. A harder ball helps in high humidity or in low sea level areas, where thick air slows the ball down. \n\nConversely, cold weather tends to harden the ball. Players can counteract the effect by choosing lower compression balls. Softer balls also help in high altitudes where air is thinner and there is less resistance",7666

3,"are there in student loans out there to help with the cost college.? ; even though you make a little over the guidelines to quailfy for a student loan? ; try and stay away from loans.  It takes years to pay them back.  I only owed $10,000 coming out of undergrad, and some months I was paying back over $400 a month (I didn't consolidate).  It took me 7 years to pay them, and I made accelerated payments when I could.  7 years paying up to $400 a month is a real dent in your standard of living, and that was only for $10,000!  Nowadays people come out owing a lot more than that.  Try this instead:\n\nThere are tons of scholarships that go unclaimed each year. Many $400, $500 or $1000 scholarships never even get applied for because people think it's chump change and not worth applying for. Well, get a few of those $500 scholarships and it'll really make a dent in your tuition bill.\n\nDo a search on scholarships, search your major, your ethnic heritage, your town, your parents employers, your employer, hobbies, high school, local chamber of commerce/rotary/ lion's club etc. Left-handed? There is a scholarship out there for you! Older woman returning to school? There are scholarships out there for you. Do combined searches on more than one criteria ""hispanic women aviation scholarships"" etc.\n\nGo to the library and ask the reference librarian for a reference book on scholarships. They usually have more than one. There are all kinds of scholarships out there, you just have to start applying yourself and make it your summer career to send out letters everyday for scholarships.

1,"Why do they use salt in the process of making ice cream? ; in the process of making ice cream they use salt and ice to freeze it..what does the salt do? ; While it lowers the mp of water as stated earlier (a colligative property), more importantly, the dissolving process (measured by heat of solvation) is endothermic.  It takes energy to separate the ions in the salt (solute).  That energy comes from the solvent (water).\n\nTherefore, the solution cools.  (BTW, the salt goes into the cooling or refrigerant bath, not the edible product itself).\n\nIf you start with ice water(0 C), then you end up cooler than zero.

2,"can I call different dentists to get an estimate on a root canal? ; I went to the dentist and was told I would need a root canal and crown. I believe his fee is very high. I was wondering if I could get estimates from other dentists. Is it ok to call around and ask what other dentists would charge for the same procedure? ; No you can't call around and get a quote on a root canal from different dentists.  It's not like buying car insurance. You will not be able to get a price from a dentist without him/her seeing you first. By law they can not quote you a price for a procedure without seeing you first. It's the same thing as calling a Dr. you've never seen before and asking them to diagnose your problem over the phone. It can't be done. There are many types of root canals and they all cost different prices. It also depends on what tooth it is and what kind of crown the dentist will put on it. Most people think there's a set fee for this type of procedure but that isn't the case. It is a case by case scenario and if you feel like the price is too high at your current dentist I reccomend getting a copy of your xray and getting a second opinion.  Normally for a root canal and a crown you are looking at spending around $900 for both. Of course, if you have insurance then the price would be drastically less.  Some dentists have payment plans/options and I would look into that if you are paying cash for this. Good luck, I have had a root canal and crown myself and it's not fun!",7732

In July 1994 Deputy Attorney General Jamie S. Gorelick told the House Select Committee on Intelligence that the president ""has inherent authority to conduct warrantless searches for foreign intelligence purposes."" [51] According to Gorelick, the president (or his attorney general) need only satisfy himself that an American is working in conjunction with a foreign power before a search can take place.\n\nAttorney General Reno has already signed off on the warrantless search of an American home on the basis of the dubious ""inherent authority"" theory. [54] The actual number of clandestine ""national security"" searches conducted since 1993 is known only to the White House and senior Justice Department officials. ; Only partially right.\n\nYou're missing an important part. Hmmm. Seems to be missing from the site you posted as well.\n\nFirst, if trying to construct an argument, you may want to pull facts from something other than a conservative spin house. By the way, the same goes for liberals. I'm tired of seeing people posting links to places of strong bias.\n\nAnyway, let's get back to this. The part your missing is when Clinton got the smack layed down on him.\n\nYou see, he had the authority in 1993 but he didn't use it  (or get caught rather) until a few years later. When he did, the courts basically said ""Are you insane?"". After that, Clinton had to go get FISA warrants.\n\nYou may be to young to remember, but there was indeed an uproar over this. At least, amongst the people I knew then (many of them liberals).\n\nMy view on the whole thing is to get rid of it. It's to dangerous in the hands of the executive, especially when said executive has granted himself to power to declare whether or not someone is an enemy.\n\nI don't want to see ANYONE with that power.

1,"Do the infected from 28 Days later qualify as zombies? ; It is my understanding that George Ramero created the first zombies and I guess he is entitled to define what a zombie is.  From what I've gathered Ramero zombies are ""living dead""  which is in direct contradiction with the creatures from 28 days later because they are infected living.  However, I tend to qualify zombies as displaying a certain core set of behaviors characterized chiefly by mindless blood lust and a complete lack of higher reasoning skill.  What do you think? ; As a zombie lover and self proclaimed expert I feel obligated to weigh in here.\n\nWhile Romero makes claims of bring zombies to the cinema and mainstream, stories of zombies predates him by a long shot. While I think he is credited with making them Hollywood stars, even in film they predate him.\n\nThat said, your question was about 28 days later and Night of the Living Dead...\n\nMost dictionary definitions of zombie define them as mindless, and the walking dead. So lets look at 28 days later.\n\nWe have the Rage virus. It first kills its victims then reanimates them as living dead. While they are not totally mindless, they do seem to have lost much of it. So based on the dictionary meaning, I have to say that 28 Days Later does fit the Hollywood definitio of a zombie. \n\nNight of the Living dead, you have zombies that again infect the living through biting. It kills them and they reanimate as the walking dead. Same thing. Who is to say that Romeros zombies are not infected with Rage as well?\n\nIf you go over the genere you will see anything from meterorites, to alien DNA as the cause of zombies.\n\nWhat I find sad is that no one has created a thining man's zombie. While the walking dead is creepy and the sheer numbers poses some problems. In most cases, staying calm and outrunning them seems to work. Why? Because they are all dumb as can be. But what if a zombie retained just half of its reasoning. Imagine a zombie invasion then? You would have cop zombies and military zombies and all sorts of specialty zombies working together to zombify all the living. That is a far scarier situation.\n\n\nI stand firm in thinking that the 28 days later zombies also displayed a core set of behaviors and were chiefly mindless.",8087

I can not explain to you how it felt,more pain than I have ever tried to withstand.I lost 18 pounds in 3 weeks,I slept all the time-at least when I was not crying.\nIt had nothing to do with wanting to be dead-I just wanted the hurt to stop because I could no longer stand it.\nDue to a miracle I was saved (yes, my dr. used that term) and I checked myself into a psychartic hospital for the sucidial where I meet lots of people like me.I was there 2 weeks.\nI learned so much from those people and often think of them.\nIn the hospital was a children's ward and the kids would come to the cafeteria as a group-all those teenage girls some with there wrists bandaged.\nBut one sticks in my mind-the youngest one there-a 3 year old boy who had cut his wrists with a knife. The nurse told me it was not his first attempt.\nSuicidal people do not have the same thought process as ""normal"" people.They can be born that way or have a tramatic experience that ""changes"" there thought process.\nEveryone I met in the hospital said the same thing-not one of us WANTED to die we didn't think we had a RIGHT to die.\nSuicide is about a person being in so much pain,crushing pain,unbearbale pain,non-stop pain that death is a way to relieve the pain.\nYou may use any of this in your paper or email any questions to me.",8175

1,"How do 3M Tattletapes, used on library books, work? ; Tattle Tapes are used by libraries to attach to books and other media.  When you check out books, the librarians would ""desensitize"" the books.  When you return the books, they would ""sensitize"" them.  Do these systems use magnetic fields?  The amazing things about them are that they hold their sensitivity for a long time and these tapes can be desnsitize and resensitize as many times as possible. ; yes, they use magnetic fields.  3m appears to not publicize how the technology works (presumably for good reason, if it was well understood then it would be easy to defeat!)\n\nanyway i found a patent for a detection system that has some background that explains how they work.  basically they are a sandwich of 2 kinds of material.  one is a permanently magnetic material, and the other is a permanently-magnetizable material.  the poles of the two materials are oriented in opposite directions.  when you bring the magnetizable material near a strong magnet, it is magnetized, and the magnetic fields cancel out.\nthis allows them to pass through a detector without setting it off.  then when they are returned, they are exposed to a field that orients the magnetizable material the other way, which makes the fields add up into a strong magnetic field. this makes them set off the detector when you walk through it.\n\nmore info at the link below, which is not a patent for tattle-tape, but a patent for some kind of sensitizing/desensitizing system for tattle-tape:\nhttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1='tattle+tape'&OS=%22tattle+tape%22&RS=%22tattle+tape%22",8308

5,"What are some good streches? ; I have recently started to exercise a bit more, mainly by jogging/running.  I've noticed that I get shin splints just after a little bit of doing either, and it also hurts my calf muscle too.  Can anyone suggest some good streches for me to do before jogging? ; Well shin splints occur from your main calf muscle dominating all those little muscles around your bone. To help that and to prevent it from happening again, make sure to do a lot of calf raises. These strengthen all your calf muscles and also help warm up the calf muscle. \n\nTo stretch the calf muscle, you can do a couple of different stretches. You can get into a push up position on the ground with one leg, and push the heel back and down onto the ground. Feel the stretch along the back of your calf and knee. Then switch legs. You could also stand up against a rail or fence with posts about a foot or a foot and a half away. Put one foot up against the post with the heel on the ground, and sort of sit into it until you feel the pull on the back of your calf and knee. These should loosen up your calves before you run.\n\nMuscles sometimes tighten up due to deficiencies in diet, too. Try to take in more potassium. Bananas are the healthiest way to get more potassium in your diet without all the other extra sugar and yucky stuff found in orange juice or other 'sources' of potassium. If you eat a banana an hour or two before you run, your muscles won't be as prone to tightening up.\n\nHave fun exercising! Running is awesome!",8318

1,"Next Solar System moon to be discovered after Galileo found Io, Ganymede, Europa & Callisto? When? By whom? ; Was it another moon of Jupiter? Or one orbiting another planet in the Solar System? Was it soon afterwards? Or did the Church's condemnation of Galileo's findings inhibit more research from taking place for a long time? ; Titan, the largest moon of Saturn, and after Ganymede, the second-largest moon in the Solar System. Discovered by Christiaan Huygens, a Dutch astronomer on March 25th, 1655 about 45 years later than Galielo's discovery of 7th January 1610.\n\nTwo generations later suggests to me that the church did inhibit research. Telescopes existed, and the thought that if Jupiter had moons, then Saturn might have them, too, must have occurred to the astronomers of the day, Perhaps it inhibited publication more than research? Another factor to consider is that Holland was also less under the sway of Roman Catholicism than Italy had been for Galileo.\n\nHuygens named his discovery simply Saturni Luna (Latin for ""Saturn's moon"", which can also be written Luna Saturni) (De Saturni Luna observatio nova, 1656; XV). Later, Giovanni Domenico Cassini named the four moons he discovered (Tethys, Dione, Rhea and Iapetus) Lodoicea Sidera (""the stars of Louis"") to honour king Louis XIV.\n\nThe name ""Titan"" and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known come from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope, wherein he suggested the names of the Titans, sisters and brothers of Cronos (the Greek Saturn), be used.\n\nJupiter was the Roman equivalent of the Greek Zeus, and Saturn the Roman equivalent of Zeus' father, Cronos (Zeus' mother was Rhea, the name given to another of Saturn's moons).\n\nThe Huygens spacecraft and Cassini probe that explored Titan in 2004 were named after these two astronomers.",8345

If you make a few life style changes you should be able to lose quite a lot of weight by July.  You need to have a deficit of 3500 calories to lose a pound, so don't try to do it too fast. This is a system that has worked well for me and several friends have also been successful with it.\n\n1. Eat three nutritious meals and three snacks everyday. Cut out junk food. You probably need about 1500 to 1800 calories a day. Many people make the mistake of not eating enough when they try to lose weight and then become discouraged.  Use the calculator at one of the links to figure out a sensible number of calories for you.\n\n2. Drink lots of water - at least 8 big glasses as day. Lots of water is essential. Stop drinking soda and other drinks with useless calories. Eat fresh fruit instead of fruit juices - the juices are very high in calories.\n\n3. Begin a simple weight lifting program at home or at a gym. Ordinary household items (tins of soup, for example) can actually serve as weights for beginners. Buy yourself a good weight lifting book for women. Actually the ""dummies"" series of books has done a rather good one.\n\n4. Walk, walk, walk. Buy yourself a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day.  Start by walking around the block if that is what you can do now, and increase a little every day.  \n\n5. Record everything you eat and all your exercise to make sure you have a ""calorie deficit"". Two of the sites I've included will help you do that. Basically burning more calories than you take in leads to weight loss.  Remember you need a deficit of 3500 calories to lose one pound.\n\n6. If you drive, do less of it and park at the back of the parking lot instead of close to the door. Always use stairs - never the elevator or escalator.\n\n7. A mini stepper is an easy piece to equipment to have at home and gives great results. I bought mine at a second hand store for $4.   Even if you use it for a minute or two several times a day it can make a big difference.\n\nI hope these thoughts help. Be strong.  You can do this. Good luck with it.",8356

""I speculate it's because of media portrayals of blacks.""",8361

2,"Carpel Tunnel Syndrome? ; Where I work, I have to use the computer a lot, and working my wrists a lot (office work).\nIf I get CTS, and it gets to a point where it affects my work, can I get comphensation for that (from the company)? Can legal action be taken to get comphensation? ; I'm not sure what the legislation is like where you are from, but in Ontario, Canada you can be compensated for this.\nAs long as your doctor can prove that your work caused your CTS then you can be compensated for it. CTS is also a specific injury to the median nerve in your wrists (whereby it affects the muscles), so if those aren't directly affected you cannot be diagnosed with CTS. \nI'm also not really sure about taking ""legal action"" against your employer. The basic reason a compensation board exists is to protect a worker AND the employer. It protects the worker by allowing them to keep their job if they are injured on the job (in the ""olden days"" workers would lose their jobs if they attempted to put the blame on their employers for an injury), on the other hand, it also protects the employer by compensating workers without worrying about being sued if an injury were to arise.\nIt's best to check this out with your local compensation board. In Canada, each province has their own.\nAlso, recognizing that you might get CTS due to your work is a great step is realizing that your workstation needs to be readjusted (see Ergonomics). If your workstation is giving you pain by the end of the day, ask your supervisor or HR to have an ergonomic assessment done to readjust everything in your workplace, this will help to make things more comfortable for you. And if they don't agree to that, kindly remind them that if your problem gets worse you WILL seek compensation for it and that equals lost time from work!",8393
1,"how do you imagine yourself traveling on the front end of a light ray? ; Einstein said that to understand his relativity theory, one has to be able to imagine that, how do you picture it?\ntalking about physics, if you dont have a sence of physics, don't answer ""uh..... yeah... pretty fast uh, and does the light have seats""? ; The universe, from your reference frame, would be length contracted into a single plane perpendicular to your direction of motion, thus enabling you to cross it by traveling no distance. Time for you would be stopped completely, thus you would travel this no distance in no time, at a speed of precisely c in your reference frame (light does that in every reference frame), despite the fact that by definition you are stopped in your own reference frame. Every other light ray would also travel at c in your reference frame and so would pass you in a finite period of time, except time would never move forward and so it wouldn't actually go anywhere. If you looked outside at the infinitesimally thin slice of universe, you would find that the area no distance ahead of your light ray is in the future of the origin (as viewed from any valid reference frame) and the area no distance behind it would be in the past. The beam you are riding on would have no frequency and would appear as a constant electric or magnetic field. Since the beam you are riding on is still traveling at c, it would therefore have infinite wavelength and so the field in question would permeate out to infinite distance in front of and behind you - not that it matters because there is no universe in either place. Speaking of the universe, every particle in it would appear to you to be infinitely massive and the universe would thus collapse on itself infinitely fast, if only there were time for it to do so.\n\nBy the way, there is a reason the speed of light is not considered a valid reference frame in special relativity.

The more closely you read it the more 'goodies' for various interest groups jump out that weren't even covered in news of the debates.  \n\nAlso, what seems to be holding it up is the guest worker/amnesty discussion.\n\nWhile this discussion continues, the border remains open.  Many have suggested that we at least pass a simple border security bill, not changing penalties or more rigidly criminalizing anyone, for now, and work the rest out at a pace that allows the hard questions to be looked at.  \n\nMe, if I actually had border security would support legalization for screened illegals. However, my concern is total numbers. Schools in border states are already foundering, and I think the guest worker program to keep wages permenantly depressed, on top of amnesty, is too much. They are trying to hard to give everyone everything without stopping to evaluate impact.\n\nWould you support border security first, then figure out the rest? ; I think this is the approach that SHOULD be taken.  How can you even consider guest worker programs or amnesty or ANYTHING, until you have a way to control the #'s?\n\nI too would be FAR more interested in considering some leniency for those here if I was convinced that they would be the LAST coming (from ANYWHERE).\n\nWe are the only country that does NOT have secured borders (and I do not just mean Mexcicans.

Glass conducts heat incredibly well, so you have to have an exceptionally hot, concentrated flame or else the heat that would normally melt the hole will be conducted away from the spot so it would never get hot enough.  Because glass is also very susceptible to expansion due to changes in its temperature, if you heat too quickly in an attempt to get the one spot hot enough to melt a hole, it will most likely crack or shatter before the hole is ever made.\n\nGlass is not a very forgiving thing to work with.

Ironically enough, historically, those people who you and I would really identify as acting in a Christian manner are those on the forefront of the progressive movement today.  For instance, the Christians who were anti-slavery in the 1850's, or those working for desegregation in the 1950's.  The fundamentalists were on the opposite sides back then.

3,"What were 3 main causes of the civil war?? ; I have a test tomorrow in social studies! ; The Civil War was caused by a myriad of conflicting pressures, principles, and prejudices, fueled by sectional differences and pride, and set into motion by a most unlikely set of political events.\n\nAt the root of all of the problems was the institution of slavery, which had been introduced into North America in early colonial times. The American Revolution had been fought to validate the idea that all men were created equal, yet slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies throughout the revolutionary period. Although it was largely gone from the northern states by 1787, it was still enshrined in the new Constitution of the United States, not only at the behest of the Southern ones, but also with the approval of many of the Northern delegates who saw that there was still much money to be made in the slave trade by the Yankee shipping industry. Eventually its existence came to color every aspect of American life.\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention there were arguments over slavery. Representatives of the Northern states claimed that if the Southern slaves were mere property, then they should not be counted toward voting representation in Congress. Southerners, placed in the difficult position of trying to argue, at least in this case, that the slaves were human beings, eventually came to accept the three-fifths compromise, by which five slaves counted as three free men toward that representation. By the end of the convention the institution of slavery itself, though never specifically mentioned, was well protected within the body of the Constitution.\n\nIt seemed to Thomas Jefferson and many others that slavery was on its way out, doomed to die a natural death. It was becoming increasingly expensive to keep slaves in the agrarian society of the south. Northern and Southern members of Congress voted together to abolish the importation of slaves from overseas in 1808, but the domestic slave trade continued to flourish. The invention of the cotton gin made the cultivation of cotton on large plantations using slave labor a profitable enterprise in the deep South. The slave became an ever more important element of the southern economy, and so the debate about slavery, for the southerner, gradually evolved into an economically based question of money and power, and ceased to be a theoretical or ideological issue at all. It became an institution that southerners felt bound to protect.\n\nBut even as the need to protect it grew, the ability, or at least the perceived ability of the South to do so was waning. Southern leaders grew progressively more sensitive to this condition. In 1800 half of the population of the United States had lived in the South. But by 1850 only a third lived there and the disparity continued to widen. While northern industrial opportunity attracted scores of immigrants from Europe in search of freedom the South's population stagnated. Even as slave states were added to the Union to balance the number of free ones, the South found that its representatives in the House had been overwhelmed by the North’s explosive growth. More and more emphasis was now placed on maintaining parity in the Senate. Failing this, the paranoid theory went, the South would find itself at the mercy of a government in which it no longer had an effective voice. Never mind that slavery was protected under the constitution, and that it would have been impossible to make amendments to abolish it. Jefferson Davis, at the time a Senator from Mississippi, summed up the sectionalist argument himself. Speaking, in effect, to the people of the North concerning slavery, “It is not humanity that influences you… it is that you may have a majority in the Congress of the United States and convert the Government into an engine of Northern aggrandizement… you want by an unjust system of legislation to promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.” There, in plain English, is the shrill, accusat",8670

3,"what are methods/ways of encouraging behavior (good OR bad) in the classroom??? ; do you have any creative ideas about how to encourage students in the classroom???  PLEASE, any answers would be greatly appreciated!  thanks! ; Younger children respond very well to short-term, visible goals like using sticker charts and small rewards at the end of a specific amount of time.  Depending on the kid this can be from good behavior during 1 period of class (particularly kids that are restless or have ADD, ADHD) or 1 week of periods.  Whenever you catch a student displaying good behavior in class you should acknowledge it publicly, it motivates that particular kid and it sets the right example for the rest of the class; be careful not to pick the same kid always since it can lead to labels such as ""Teacher's pet, etc"", I think all of our students, no matter their differences, behave good from time to time and we should try to find those instances and reward them.  Something that works really well with my students is sending notes to their houses when they have behaved in a particular good way, and I think parents also appreciate teachers that communicate with them for other than give out complaints about their kids.  I try not to criticize students' bad behavior in front of their classmates, unless it was a serious offense like hitting someone; some students like the attention and it may backfire if you criticize in front of the rest.  I ask them to leave the room with me (try to do it a little later, so you have time to think things through and don't say anything you might regret afterwards) and talk to them in private about their behavior and the consequence it will have.  This year I also had a talk with all of my students about how to solve problems among themselves and we settle on 3 rules to do so:  \n1. They should talk to the kid first and tell them that they don't like the attitude they have and to stop please doing ...whatever.\n2. If the problem continues, the student talks to whichever teacher is present in class at that moment.\n3. If the problem continues or the other teacher dismisses it they should approach the homeroom teacher (me).\nSomething very important is that you should make sure that your students understand that under no circumstances you will scold or criticize the other kid in front of them, sometimes they think that you did nothing and they tell their parents that the teacher did nothing to deal with the other student.\nHope it helps",8788

2,"how to lose weight? ; i am 11 years old and my weight is 40 kg ; It surprises many people how much weight they can lose in just one week if they start paying attention to exactly how they live their lives. Because most of us have such fast paced, busy lives we tend to do the things that are most convenient, but often this is not what is best for our bodies. Fast food, frozen food, and very little exercise is what is usually most convenient. Luckily, there are ways to make eating healthier and to even fit in some exercise, even if you are one of the very busy!\n\nFirst, you need to look at your diet. Sometimes the things that lead to us being over weight are things that we just take for granted or don’t even really think about. Oddly enough, the biggest culprits are not what we even have to chew we simply have to swallow! Drinks! When you are thirsty and you need to grab something quick you just go to the fridge or the soda machine and crack open that can or bottle of soda. While the soda is mildly refreshing, it’s also packed with calories. If you are drinking even two or three regular sodas per day you’ll find that you are adding anywhere from 600 to 1,000 extra calories every day. If you cut out the regular soda you’ll find that the pounds will start dropping within a couple days. Many people find that they can easily lose up to 20 pounds over the course of just a few months when they stop drinking soda, but the initial weight loss is seen the first week.

1,"how can i make a rocket out of common household items? ; must make at least 40 pounds of thrust ; I used to make rockets when I was young. A lot of them exploded, but I used many different oxidiser/fuel combinations - fuels including aluminium,red phosphorous, carbon, icing sugar, etc and oxidisers like ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, nitrocellulose (home made and lots of fun) but these are not readily availible. The easiest way of making a rocket from readily availible items (not really household items but easy to obtain) would be to use gunpowder (made from flowers of sulphur, sulpheter (potassium nitrate) and charcoal powder). Do an internet search for gunpowder. Tips - be very careful (I take no responsiblity if you hurt yourself), grind the powders as fine as possible - the finer the better - use a pestle and motar, use some sort of binder if possible - even if it's sugar). The rocket shell must be strong and light - learn from the rockets in fireworks - it is easiest to use a cardboard shell with a plaster of paris plug at the top and a plaster of paris nozzle on the other end. I tried metal shells - they heat up quickly, weaken and burst open. Ignite electronically from a distance (use a battery, a long cable and fuse wire in the fuel at the exit nozzle of the rocket). \n\nThere are some general guide lines - you will have to experiment with nozzle design, length/diameter ratios of rocket, fuel composition (burn speed) and ways of packing the fuel. One can make a hollow along the center of the rocket from top to bottom to facilitate gas flow and uniform  burning - check out basic solid fuel rocket designs on the google and the net. There are also various types of launch pads you can use to make sure your rocket is going in a straight line with enough velocity to keep on a straight path. You should also put stabilising fins on the base of your rocket. \n\nWhen you get more advanced, you can include some kind of parachute to deploy when the fuel is spent (using a secondary charge to pop open the cone and release it)\n\nBe sure to launch the rockets in an open field of green grass (to avoid possible fires) and away from any houses or people. There are lots of amature rocket clubs. I suggest you join one and get some advice there. They generally buy their rocket engines off the shelf with fixed burn rates, burn times and total thrust. These are more reliable, more consistent and safer than home made engines. You will have to do lots of research to get all the information you need - and the internet is great for that.\n\nGood luck and remember - safety first!",8906

3,"how can a library affect me? (positively) arggg? ; need a paragrahf less then 400 words. about a public library afecting your life. ; A library cannot affect you by itself. You affect yourself by your purposes, methods and goals in using it. Our US public libraries are storage and lending points for all kinds of materials; written, audio, video, lyrical, artistic. Much like a great big toolbox. Having tools and a toolbox doesn't do anything. You, the individual, have to use them.\n\nA guitar player can get sheet music, check out performance videos, see what's written on the history of guitars, find manufacturers, read how to repair or build a guitar and watch a video on it, listen to guitar variations from around the world and throughout recorded history and browse the magazine section to see the latest happenings. Probably check his email at the same time. O.K., that's the library for the guitarist.\n\nNow what about the mechanic, the accountant, the householder, the parent, the physician, the student, the teacher, the aged, the young?\n\nEach of them can make their own individual and unique use of library materials. Entertainment. Knowledge. Pleasure. Utility.\n\nLibraries also are center points for some civic activities. Special interest clubs meet there. Lectures are presented. Readings (oral presentations) are done in libraries, live. Sometimes even drama. Socializing is not thought of as a library function, but it can be. \n\nHow does a library affect you positively? You will have to decide that. The meaning of anything is the meaning you give it. If you decide you want no association with libraries, then they'll still have an affect on you -- by depriving you of meeting people you'd like to know who are going there or by enhancing your life by not meeting people you wouldn't like to know who are going there. Even without going, you decide how the library affects you.\n\n(edit)\nI like that first answer. It's fanciful.",9007

In South Africa, for example, the administrative capital is Pretoria, the legislative capital is Cape Town, and the judicial capital is Bloemfontein, the outcome of the compromise that created the Union of South Africa in 1910.\n\nIn others, the ""effective"" and ""official"" capital may differ for pragmatic reasons, resulting in a situation where a city known as ""the capital"" is not, in fact, host to the seat of government:\n\n-Yamoussoukro was designated the national capital of Côte d'Ivoire in 1983, but as of 2004 most government offices and embassies were still located in Abidjan \n-Sucre is still the constitutional capital of Bolivia, but most of the national government long abandoned that region for La Paz \n-Amsterdam is the nominal national capital of the Netherlands even though the Dutch government and supreme court are both located in The Hague.\n-Kuala Lumpur is the nominal capital of Malaysia even though the Malaysian government is located in Putrajaya.\n \nIn such cases, the city housing the administrative capital is usually understood to be the ""national capital"" among outsiders. For instance, Santiago is understood to be the capital of Chile even though its Congress is in Valparaiso.\n\nHey, this is REALLY REALLY COOL and really answers your question!

In return Zeus gave Amalthea the goat's horn. It had the power to give to the person in possession of it whatever he or she wished for. This gave rise to the legend of the cornucopia. The original depictions were of the goat's horn filled with fruits and flowers: deities, especially Fortuna, would be depicted with the horn of plenty.\nIn modern depiction, the cornucopia is a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket typically filled with various kinds of festive fruit and vegetables. The cornucopia has come to be associated with Thanksgiving.",9122

2,"Do fat people get stomach aches? ; I know when I eat too much I get a stomach ache ; Researchers at the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory have found new clues to how the brain and the stomach interact with emotions to cause overeating and obesity. By looking at how the human brain responds to ""fullness"" messages sent to the brain by an implanted device that stimulates the stomach, the scientists have identified brain circuits that motivate the desire to overeat in the obese -- the same circuits that cause addicted individuals to crave drugs. The scientists have also verified that these circuits play a critical role in eating behaviors linked to soothing negative emotions. The study appears in the October 17, 2006 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, published online in PNAS Early Edition the week of October 2.\n\nThis study opens new territory in understanding how the body and brain connect to each other, and how this connection is tied to obesity,"" said lead author Gene-Jack Wang of Brookhaven Lab's Center for Translational Neuroimaging. ""We were able to simulate the process that takes place when the stomach is full, and for the first time we could see the pathway from the stomach to the brain that turns 'off' the brain's desire to continue eating.""",9139

So explanations are much appreciated as they will help me to understand it a little better. Thank you so much!! ; Let B mean the genotype for dominant black fur and b mean the genotype for brown fur. \n\nRecall that when a gene is dominant, it is always expressed when  it is present. When a gene is recessive then it is ONLY expressed  when there is no alternative.\n\na) Pure black mice would have B1B2 and brown mice must be b1b2 because it is a recessive gene. (I've put in the numbers to act as subscripts so it makes more sense.) Crossing these, you would get offspring that inherit one gene from each parent.\nB1b1 ==> black\nB1b2 ==> black\nB2b1 ==> black\nB2b2 ==> black\n\nSo false because all the offspring from pure black and brown rats would be black. \n\nb) True. Pure black mice have BB. As both parents have BB then there's not a chance for bb to occur!\n\nc) False. Brown mice are always bb (recessive) so bb x bb can never result in Bb or BB. So offspring of 2 brown mice are always brown.\n\nd) Heterozygous black mice are Bb. So crossed with brown mouse bb (b1b2):\nBb1 ==> black\nbb1 ==> brown\nBb2 ==> black\nbb2 ==> brown\nSo you get equal numbers of black and brown offspring. True.",9171

All numbers are in degrees ; cos(a+b) = cos(a) cos(b) - sin(a) sin(b) \nand \nsin(a+b) = sin(a) cos(b) + sin (b) cos(a)\n\nSo first expand sin(x + 150°) into sin(x)cos(150°) +sin(150°)cos(x)\nand expand cos(x + 120°) into cos(x)cos(120°) - sin(x)sin(120°).\nnow sin (150°) is 1/2 and cos(150°) is sqrt(3)/2, sin(120°) is sqrt(3)/2 and cos(120°) is 1/2. So you have cos x - sqrt(3)/2(sin x) - 1/2cos(x) + 1/2cos x - sqrt(3)/2 sin x = cos x -sqrt(3)sin x. I assume you followed the same steps and mixed up a minus sign.

The greatest disservice these people play in society is to present the idea to children that science is somehow seriously flawed and that nothing can ever be proven - unlike their belief system, however, which has a complete video record of god creating the earth in 6 days (sorry, that was sarcasm...something bible literalists will have a hard time understanding).\n\nTo Vangyblue below - that's the biggest pile of nonsense I've read for for at least 30 minutes.

If we fought a military action, I think it would be brief and simple, involving mostly naval and air forces to bomb and destroy Iranian nuclear reactors.\n\nI think the war would also be coalition-based, with UN and EU forces participating. After destroying the reactors, we would probably end the fighting.\n\nThis is similar to the 1981 bombings of that Iraqi nuclear plant by the IDF-AF (Israeli Defense Forces/Air Force). Except this time, we'll be fighting with a coalition.\n\nI am not sure if Israel should participate in this war.

She said it was her favorite holiday and she wanted to do it. I said no problem I just thought it would make things a little easier so that we wouldn't have to go to her house at 12 and my moms at 5. I have no problem doing that but my mother inlaw does. She thinks you should go to one place for the holidays I have always went to 2 familys for thanksgiving and I want to keep it that way. I like to see my family every year as well as my husbands family and I am willing to do both.\nMy mother-in-law is being really selfish she calls last night to talk to my husband and they are discusing Thanksgiving my husband tells her that we won't be eating dinner there we will have appitizers and stay a while but we are eating at my wifes mothers because we ate last year at your house for dinner. This is the problem my mom is flexible she will do lunch or dinn ; My mother-in-law told my husband and I she was not doing Thanksgiving or Christmas this year because of money, because her diabetes is getting worse and because she is tired of her son eating and running.  She does not take into account that her son works at night and has to sleep during the day.  She fixes the meal according to her schedule only.  Since she told us she wasn't cooking, we made our own pans to invite my brother over, as he has no other family in the area except us.  My husband told his mother when she asked later if we ever made other plans.  He told her and she got ill.  She went off on him because her, her husband, and her mother  weren't invited over.  He tried to explain that the seating just isn't there and she said we'd have to make our own plans.  Now she is doing nothing but laying guilt trips on him and it's working...to a point.  She will never change.  Part of it is because she is selfish and needy, though perfectly capable.  She is also jealous because he doesn't spend as much time kissing her butt.   \n\nYou are not alone.  It will either blow over or it won't.  You and your husband need to come up with a plan for the holidays.  The one you have sounds like a good one.

Now that is priceless. Leave everyone to there own religion, just ask your questions, and let peace be with everyone. No matter who there God is, most here have genuine questions. ; It is true that Jehovah's Witnesses are not loved by everyone.\nhttp://jw-media.org/newsroom/human_rights.htm\nSome people hate Jehovah's Witnesses out of ignorance, or over some misunderstanding. A few may have had a bad personal experience with an individual who claimed to be a Jehovah's Witness, and prejudicially extended their animus to this entire Christian religion.\n\nHowever, it seems that the majority of anti-Witness hatred is motivated by religious intolerance and bigotry. A few may even be motivated against their Christian worship by the unseen 'god of this system of things', Satan the Devil.\n\n(2 Corinthians 4:4) the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers\n\nInterestingly, such ""hatred"" should be expected by true Christians in this time of the end, and it actually helps identify Jehovah's Witnesses as Christ's true disciples:\n\n(John 15:19) If you were part of the world, the world would be fond of what is its own. Now because you are no part of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on this account the world hates you.\n\n(Luke 6:22) Happy are you whenever men hate you, and whenever they exclude you and reproach you and cast out your name as wicked for the sake of the Son of man.\n\n(1 Peter 4:4) Because you do not continue running with them in this course to the same low sink of debauchery, they are puzzled and go on speaking abusively of you.\n\n(2 Timothy 4:3-5) For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories. You, though, keep your senses in all things, suffer evil, do the work of an evangelizer, fully accomplish your ministry.\n\nIt seems signficant that the relatively small religion of Jehovah's Witnesses are the ones best known for their worldwide preaching work. Yet Jesus commanded that ALL who would call themselves ""Christian"" perform this public work:\n\n(Matthew 28:19,20) Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. And, look!

WHen the ball bounces back up it gains potential energy and kinetic energy.  In a perfect system with no friction, Pe + Ke at any given time would remain a constant number.  In reality, a little energy is lost due to friction.",9428

3,"can someone help me with the book ""Empire"" by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri? ; what is this book about\ncan someone please summarize Empire from pages 21-41 \nor can you just give me the basic idea of it\nthanks ; Imperialism as we knew it may be no more, but Empire is alive and well. It is, as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri demonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. It is easy to recognize the contemporary economic, cultural, and legal transformations taking place across the globe but difficult to understand them. Hardt and Negri contend that they should be seen in line with our historical understanding of Empire as a universal order that accepts no boundaries or limits. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers. \n\nEmpire identifies a radical shift in concepts that form the philosophical basis of modern politics, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, and people. Hardt and Negri link this philosophical transformation to cultural and economic changes in postmodern society--to new forms of racism, new conceptions of identity and difference, new networks of communication and control, and new paths of migration. They also show how the power of transnational corporations and the increasing predominance of postindustrial forms of labor and production help to define the new imperial global order. \n\nMore than analysis, Empire is also an unabashedly utopian work of political philosophy, a new Communist Manifesto. Looking beyond the regimes of exploitation and control that characterize today's world order, it seeks an alternative political paradigm--the basis for a truly democratic global society. \n\ncc",9588

2,"how can i gain wait????????????????????????????????????????? ; i am a 11 yr old girl, 5ft 1"" and i way 83 lbs. every one says i am 2 skinny \ni no i am but cant get fat i try to gain but very very tough ; Well, I have a bit of the same problem. Like you, I've been lean my whole life. If you feel you are underweight, try going to see a doctor who can check out your thyroid. You may have what I have, hyperthyroid. So we burn off energy faster than the normal person which is why we stay lean. However, to gain weight consists of certain factors. For one, people will tell you to try eating more. Instead, write down what you eat for about a week and then compare it to the food pyramid. Based on what you eat, it will tell you what food to eat more of to gain weight. For me, I realized I needed to eat more carbohydrates. Be careful if people tell you to eat a lot of protein. Everything must be done in moderation. Too much protein can have an effect on female hormonic changes as well as other things not so good. Also, start weight lifting. This will increase muscle as well as weight (What's called BMI; you can look it up online). I hope I've been of some help.",9593

5,"What is the longest home run ball ever hit?? ; Go Tigers!!! ; Their really isn't one correct answer to this question, I'll try to explain. I’ll start with the home run that Mickey Mantle hit at Griffith Stadium in Washington on April 17, 1953. The entire baseball world was led to believe the ball had traveled 565 feet from home plate to the point where it landed.\nIn truth, that figure derived from the distance from home plate to the place where a neighborhood child retrieved the ball. However, the actual distance in the air was probably about 510 feet (most sources still have this as #1). The same process happened again with Mantle on September 10, 1960 at Briggs Stadium in Detroit when a ball he hit was reported to have traveled 643 feet but it is readily apparent once again that the ball had bounced several times before it reached the estimated distance (this is the home run that the ""Guinness Book of Records"" has as #1). When your talking about tape measure home runs you can’t leave out Babe Ruth. It was said that Ruth once hit one 587 feet in an exhibition game against the Giants back in 1919. Also his tremendous blow to right-center field in Detroit on June 8, 1926, has often been reported as traveling 628 feet, but again was it measured where it first landed or where it came to a rest. Included among the other great exaggerations in the history of tape measure home runs are Dave Nicholson’s Comiskey Park rooftopper on May 6, 1964 who’s shot was calculated at 573 feet. The calculations were on the assumption that the ball traveled completely over the left-center-field roof. However, subsequent\ninvestigation indicated that the ball landed on the back of the roof before bouncing out into the night. Also, when Dave Kingman launched his wind-aided blow in Chicago’s Wrigley Field on April 14, 1976, ""The New York Times"" somehow concluded that it had flown 630 feet. It has been confirmed that the ball struck against the third house beyond Waveland Avenue, which is situated about 530 feet from home plate. Yet another claim (by the ""Guinness Book of Records""), has a minor league player by the name of Roy Edward ""Dizzy"" Carlyle having hit one 618 feet at Emeryville Ball Park, CA on July 4, 1929. Mark McGwire hit several home runs over 500 feet and one over 540 and his is measured accurately every time he hits one. I know I didn’t cover everything but I hope I covered enough to satisfy you.\n\nAlso, Mantle's home run off the facade at Yankee Stadium on May 22, 1963 traveled between 370 to 374 feet and was between 115 to 117 feet high. If it was still going up like some people claim it would have traveled an estimated distance of 620 feet if left unimpeded. However, the reality is that the ball was already on its way down, and those reporting the trajectory were victimized by a common optical illusion. It is a scientific fact that if Mantle, or anyone else, had sufficient strength to hit a ball that was still traveling upward when it met the towering facade, he would also have enough strength to clear that same facade by a distance of at least 100 feet. In order for the ball to be rising at roof level, it would have to have been traveling at a lower angle than that which produces maximum distance. If Mantle had provided the same power or velocity, but had launched the ball at a higher and more efficient angle, it would have passed out of Yankee Stadium at a height of over 200 feet! Mantle hit the facade on two or perhaps three occasions, but never cleared it.\nSource(s):\nYou can also go to:\n\nhttp://www.baseball-almanac.com/feats/ar...",9694

Asian and African elephants are in completely genera, and they can produce hybrid offspring.\n\nChimp/human hybrids, despite their questionable existence, even have a name.  They are called chumans or humanzees.

1,"two physics questions, if you could help me step by step that'd be great since my teacher doesn't teach. ; 1) A clerk moves a box of cans down an aisle by pulling on a rope attached to the box. The clerk pulls with a force of 188 N at an angle of 25.0° with the horizontal. The box has a mass of 36.9 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction between box and floor is 0.450. Find the acceleration of the box.\n\n2)A box of books weighing 259 N is shoved across the floor by a force of 435 N exerted downward at an angle of 35° below the horizontal. \n\n(a) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.57, how long does it take to move the box 9 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n(b) If µk between the box and the floor is 0.75, how long does it take to move the box 7 m, starting from rest? (If the box will not move, enter 0.)\n\n--what do the symbols even mean.... so yeah im really lost if u guys could explain how to do these probs so i know in the future, i'd appreciate it a lot. thanks ; 1) The angle of the rope needs to be considered to calculate horizontal and vertical components of the clerk's force. \nFh = 188*cos(25) = 170 N This is what pulls the box.\nFv = 188*sin(25) = 79.5 N This actually lifts the box slightly.\n\nThe symbol for coefficient of kinetic friction is µk. A lower number makes it easier to move the box - if you spilled some olive oil on the floor µk would perhaps go to 0.1. N is normal force. If this was on a slope, normal would be different from weight, but the floor here is level so N = W? \n\nActually no. Because the rope pulls up on the box slightly, the normal force pressing the box to the floor is less than the box's full weight. The box's weight = m*g = 36.9 kg*9.8 m/s^2 = 362 N. The vertical component of the tension in the rope relieves 79.5 N of that so N = 362 - 79.5 N = 282 N. \n\nSo Ff = .450*282 N = 127 N is the force that friction fights with. The horizontal portion of the clerk's pull is 170 N. So there is 43 N left over to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law says\nF = m*a\n43 N = 36.9 kg*a\nso a = 1.17 m/s^2\n\n2) Here the force is directed down at an angle so the vertical component of the force will add to the normal force used in calculating the friction.\nFh = 435 N*cos(35) = 356 N\nFv = 435 N*sin(35) = 250 N\n\nN = the weight of the box + Fv = 259 N + 250 N = 509 N\n\na) Ff = µk*N = .57* 509 N = 290 N This is not enough to hold the box stationary so 356 - 290 N = 66 N are available to accelerate the box. Newton's 2nd law again:\nBut first we need the box's mass. W = m*g\nm = W/g = 259/9.8 N = 26.4 kg. Now\nF = m*a\n66 N = 26.4 kg*a\na = 66/26.4 m/s^2 = 2.5 m/s^2\n\nThis is getting complicated. To move 9 m will take t seconds:\nx = (1/2)*a*t^2 Solve for t.\n\nb) Ff = µk*N = .75* 509 N = 381 N This is more than the horizontal portion of the clerk's push, so the box will resist. The answer is 0.",9800

Thanks!? ; Also, anyone who has a maid, how much do you pay them per hr? ; You can start by reading the article ""Starting a Janitorial and Cleaning Service Business"" at  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol95/janitorial.htm. The article contains information on startup strategies, operational considerations (prices, manpower, finding suppliers), and marketing the business. \n\nFrom the article, here are some tips:\n\n1. The first step to marketing your business is deciding who your potential customers are and determining the types of services you could offer. \n\n2. The best way to market this business is through cold calling. Drive through the area to look for newly opened businesses, buildings or facilities. Then introduce yourself to the landlords ­ your potential clients ­ and request for an opportunity to bid on their cleaning contract. \n\n3. Draw up a better and more professional proposal by learning firsthand the needs of the potential customer, as well as the layout of the facility (e.g. type of carpeting, etc.)\n\n4.  Networking is another effective strategy to get ahead in the janitorial business. Aside from newly opened buildings, get a list of companies that are downsizing or laying off cleaning staffs.\n\n5. Word of mouth is another effective form of advertising a janitorial service. It can be generated through favorable feedback from your existing clients that will hopefully filter to other building owners or entrepreneurs in your area.\n\n6. If you decide to embark on advertising, you can try placing an ad in newspapers or trade journals in your area. \n\n7. You can also try direct mailing to potential customers, sending them information and brochures about your business.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information I suggest you read the following books:\n\n- Janitorial Service Businesses : Strategies for Promoting, Estimating, and Bidding Cleaning Services \n- The Janitorial Contractors Bible \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business \n- Cleaning Up for a Living: Everything You Need to Know to Become a Successful Building Service Contractor \n- Introduction to Janitorial Service Contracting : How to Succeed in Your Own Cleaning Business",9819

4,"amazon.com and amazon marketplace is the same thing? ; if not, whats the difference? ; Amazon Marketplace is is where sellers other than Amazon can sell their used or new items. When you are looking at an item, look to see who it is available from. It can say one or both of the following: Ships from and sold by Amazon.com and/or available from these sellers. In my experience as an employee, I have seen items ship all over the world. If it says ships from and sold by Amazon then it should ship anywhere in the world. If you select an item from a different seller, there is a chance that they will not ship overseas. The great thing about Amazon is that they will post a link to sellers of an item even if they sell it cheaper than Amazon does. That way, you have a choice as to where to go to purchase an item.\n\nOf course, if you are still unsure about shipping to your country, you can always email customer service. The website also lists links to several of their international sites.\n\nThe first link I've listed should take you to a a portion of Amazon's site that lists deadlines for international orders. The second will take you to an Amazon.com help page that will have helpful information on it. Both will have a button on it that you can click on to contact customer service.\n\nHope this helps!",9925
